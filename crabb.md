####aback
**ABACK, BACKWARD, BEHIND, REARWARD, RETROGRADE, SURPRISE.**  
_Aback_, in Anglo-Saxon, _on bœc_, at or on the back, is applied both to persons and localities. A person goes _aback, backward_, or _rearward_, or he _retrogrades_ when in a movement opposite to forward or going ahead, and he goes _behind_ when he passes from the front to the rear, and also when he fails to maintain a set gait in a movement or a course in a study. An object is _behind_ or to the _rearward_ of another object according as it is placed or becomes situated. In navigation, a sail is _aback_ when pressed against a mast. A person _surprised_, taken unawares, or suddenly astonished, confused, or perplexed, is said to be _taken aback._

####abaft 
**ABAFT, AFT, BEHIND, REARWARD, ASTERN.**  
These words abound in nautical language, and, in relation to a given point forward or ahead of something on shipboard, imply localities. _Abaft_, from _a_ (on) and Anglo-Saxon _be-œftan_ (itself a combination of _be_ (by) and _œftan_, an adverb meaning behind or back), is the opposite of _afore._ The original stem of the word appears in the phrase _fore and aft._

####abandon 
**ABANDON, DESERT, FORSAKE, RELINQUISH.**  
The idea of leaving or separating one's self from an object is common to these terms, which vary in the circumstances of the action. _Abandon_, from Old French _à bandon_ (proscription, control, ban), meant originally to put under a public ban, to proscribe utterly. _Desert_, from Late Latin _deserto_, is derived from the privative _de_ and the verb _sero_, meaning bind or join, the root of which also appears in the noun _series._ It therefore signified the breaking of ties, the severing of one's connection with something. _Forsake_, compounded of the prefix _for_ and the Anglo-Saxon _sacan_, to strive, meant to strive against, to take the opposite side, hence to repudiate. _Abandoning_ is a violation of the most sacred ties, and exposes the object to every misery; _desertion_ is a breach of honor and fidelity; it deprives a person of the assistance or the countenance which he has a right to expect; by _forsaking_, the kindly feelings are hurt and the social ties are broken. A bad mother _abandons_ her offspring; a soldier _deserts_ his comrades; a man _forsakes_ his companions.  
Things as well as persons may be _abandoned, deserted_, or _forsaken;_ things only are _relinquished._ To _abandon_ may be an act of necessity or discretion, as a captain _abandons_ a vessel when it is no longer safe to remain in it. _Desertion_ is often a dereliction of duty, as to _desert_ one's post; and often an indifferent action, particularly in the sense of leaving any place which has had one's care and attention bestowed upon it, as people _desert_ a village, or any particular country where they have been established. _Forsaking_ is an indifferent action, and implies simply the leaving something to which one has been attached in one form or another; a person _forsakes_ a certain house which he has been accustomed to frequent; birds _forsake_ their nests when they find them to have been discovered. To _relinquish_ is an act of prudence or imprudence; men often inadvertently _relinquish_ the fairest prospects in order to follow some favorite scheme which terminates in their ruin.  
We may _desert_ or _forsake_ a place, but the former comprehends more than the latter; a place that is _deserted_ is left by all, and left entirely. A place may be _forsaken_ by individuals or to a partial extent.  
**ABANDON, RESIGN, RENOUNCE, ABDICATE.** — The idea of giving up is common to these terms, which signification, though analogous to the former, admits, however, of this distinction, that in the one case we separate ourselves from an object, in the other we send or cast it from us. _Abandon_ (see above). _Resign_, from _re_ and _signo_, signifies to sign away or back from one's self. _Renounce_, in Latin _renuntio_, from _nuntiare_, to tell or declare, is to declare off from a thing. _Abdicate_, from 06, from, and _dicere_, to speak, signifies likewise to call or cry off from a thing.  
We _abandon_ and _resign_ by giving up to another; we _renounce_ by sending away from ourselves; we _abandon_ a thing by transferring it to another; in this manner a debtor _abandons_ his goods to his creditors; we _resign_ a thing by transferring our possession of it to another; in this manner we _resign_ a place to a friend; we _renounce_ a thing by simply ceasing to hold it; in this manner we _renounce_ a claim or a profession. As to _renounce_, signified originally to give up by word of mouth, and to _resign_ to give up by signature, the former is consequently a less formal action than the latter; we may _renounce_ by implication; we _resign_ in direct terms; we _renounce_ the pleasures of the world when we do not seek to enjoy them; we _resign_ a pleasure, a profit, or advantage, of which we expressly give up the enjoyment. To _abdicate_ is a species of informal resignation. A monarch _abdicates_ his throne who simply declares his will to cease to reign; but a minister _resigns_ his office when he gives up the seals by which he held it. We _abandon_ nothing but that over which we have had an entire control; we _abdicate_ nothing but that which we have held by a certain right, but we may _resign_ or _renounce_ that which may be in our possession only by an act of violence; a usurper cannot be said properly to _abandon_ his people or _abdicate_ a throne, but he may _resign_ his power or _renounce_ his pretensions to a throne.  
To _abandon_ and _resign_ are likewise used in a reflective sense; the former in the bad sense, to denote the giving up the understanding to the passion, or the giving up one's self, mind and body, to bad practices; the latter in the good sense, to denote the giving up one's will and desires to one's circumstances or whatever is appointed. The soldiers of Hannibal _abandoned_ themselves to pleasure at Capua. A patient man _resigns_ himself to his fate, however severe that may be. When _resign_ is taken in the bad sense, it is not so complete a giving up of one's self as _abandonment_, which implies a yielding to a passion. See also [waive](entry://waive)

####abase 
**ABASE, HUMBLE, DEGRADE, DISGRACE, HUMILIATE, DEPRESS, LOWER, REDUCE, DEBASE.**  
To _abase_ expresses the strongest degree of self-humiliation; like the French _abaisser_, it signifies literally to bring down or make low, _abaisser_ being compounded of the intensive syllable _α_ or _ad_, and _baisser_, from Low Latin _bassare_, to make low. The root appears in the Latin _basis_, Greek _βάσις_, the lowest part of the column, from the root _βά_, to go, hence, in some cases, to stand, the basis being that on which the rest of the column stands. It implies the laying aside all the high pretensions which distinguish us from our fellow-creatures — the descending to a state comparatively low and mean. To _humble_, in French _humilier_, from the Latin _humilis_, humble, and _humus_, the ground, naturally marks a prostration to the ground, and figuratively a lowering of the thoughts and feelings. According to the principles of Christianity whoever _abaseth_ himself shall be exalted, and according to the same principles whoever reflects on his own littleness and unworthiness will daily _humble_ himself before his Maker. The _abasement_ consists in the greatest possible dejection of spirit which, if marked by an outward act, will lead to the utmost prostration of the body; _humbling_, in comparison with _abasement_, is an ordinary sentiment.  
_Abase_ and _humble_ have regard to persons considered absolutely, _degrade_ and _disgrace_ to their relative situation. To _degrade_ (see [disparage](entry://disparage)) signifies to descend from one rank (Latin _gradus_, rank, English _grade)_ to another. It supposes elevation either in outward circumstances or in public opinion. To _disgrace_, compounded of the privative _dis_ and _grace_, or favor, properly implies to put out of favor, which is always attended with circumstances of more or less ignominy. To _abase_ and _humble_ one's self may be meritorious acts as suited to the infirmity and fallibility of human nature, but to _degrade_ or _disgrace_ one's self is always a culpable act. The penitent man _humbles_ himself, the contrite man _abases_ himself, the man of rank _degrades_ himself by a too familiar deportment with his inferiors, he _disgraces_ himself by his vices. The great and good man may also be abased and humbled without being _degraded_ or _disgraced;_ his glory follows him in his _abasement_ or _humiliation_, his greatness protects him from _degradation_, and his virtue shields him from _disgrace._  
To _degrade_ has most regard to the external rank and condition, _disgrace_ to the moral estimation and character. Whatever is low and mean is _degrading_ for__ those who are not of mean condition; whatever is immoral is _disgraceful_ to all, but most so to those who ought to know better. It is _degrading_ to a nobleman to associate with prize-fighters and jockeys, it is _disgraceful_ for him to countenance a violation of the laws which he is bound to protect. The higher the rank of the individual, the greater is his _degradation;_ the higher his previous character, or the more sacred his office, the greater his _disgrace_ if his acts be inconsistent with its duties.  
Persons may sometimes be _degraded_ and _disgraced_ at the will of others, but with a similar distinction of the words. He who is not treated with the outward honor and respect he deserves is _degraded;_ he who is not regarded with the same kindness as before is _disgraced._  
These terms may be employed with a similar distinction in regard to things, and in that case they are comparable with _debase._ To _debase_, from the intensive syllable _de_ and _base_, signifying to make _base_, is applied to whatever may lose its purity or excellence.  
To _humiliate_ a person implies the doing by another or the occurrence of something that produces mortification, vexation, chagrin, etc. To _depress_, in relation to a person, is to dispirit, discourage, cast down, debilitate; in relation to material objects, it is to press or thrust down, to flatten, from above or vertically; in relation to commerce, it is to bring about a diminution or dullness in trade. To _lower_ is to lessen, bring down, change from a high price (or note in music) to a lesser one, to sink, to rebate. A person _lowers_ himself in another's estimation by a wrongful or unfriendly act. To _reduce_ is to bring into a lower state, to shorten, to condense, to abbreviate (see [abate](entry://abate)). A person is degraded or disgraced by being _reduced_ from one station to a lower one. 

####abash 
**ABASH, CONFOUND, CONFUSE.**  
_Abash_, Old French _esbahir_, an onomatopœtic word formed from the interjection _bah_ of astonishment, meant originally to amaze, astound, but it has been partly confused — with the word _abase_ and is sometimes used as an intensive of it. _Confound_ and _confuse_ are derived from different parts of the same Latin verb _confundo_ and its participle _confusus. Confundo_ is compounded of _con_ and _fundo_, to pour together. To _confound_ and _confuse_ then signify properly to melt together or into one mass what ought to be distinct; and figuratively, to derange the thoughts so that they seem melted together.  
_Abash_ expresses more than _confound_, and _confound_ more than _confuse. Abash_ has regard to the spirit which is greatly abased and lowered, _confound_ has regard to the faculties which are benumbed and crippled; _confuse_ has regard to the feelings and ideas which are deranged and perplexed. The haughty man is _abashed_ when he is humbled in the eyes of others; the wicked man is _confounded_ when his villainy is suddenly detected; a modest person may be _confused_ in the presence of his superiors.  
_Abash_ is always taken in a bad sense; neither the scorn of fools, nor the taunts of the oppressor, will _abash_ him who has a conscience void of offence toward God and man. To be _confounded_ is not always the consequence of guilt; superstition and ignorance are liable to be _confounded_ by extraordinary phenomena; and Providence sometimes thinks fit to _confound_ the wisdom of the wisest by signs and wonders, far above the reach of human comprehension. _Confusion_ is at the best an infirmity more or less excusable according to the nature of the cause: a steady mind and a clear head are not easily _confused;_ but persons of quick sensibility cannot always preserve a perfect collection of thought in trying situations; and those who have any consciousness of guilt, and are not very hardened, will be soon thrown into _confusion_ by close interrogatories.  
**TO SHAME, MORTIFY, DISCONCERT, DISCOMPOSE, DISHEARTEN, BEWILDER.** — These words signify a something done by a person or an occurrence that unpleasantly affects another person. You may _shame_ a person by exposing an act of crime, dishonor, impropriety, or breach of modesty or decorum on his part, and the person may bring the painful sensation of _shame_ upon himself by his own premeditated or incautious action. The acts that _shame_ a person may also _mortify_ him, and in addition actions of himself or others that cause in him a sense of humiliation, vexation, chagrin, or guilt, may also do so. Various substances _mortify_ when their vital functions are destroyed, the root of the word being derived from the Latin _mors, mortis_, death. Gangrene produces _mortification_ of the flesh. Some acts of penance or austerities, imposed as a punishment, are said to _mortify_ the body. To _disconcert_ and _discompose_ are closely allied to _confound_ and _confuse_, specifically meaning to disturb one's composure or self-possession. To _dishearten_ is to do that toward another that will disappoint, discourage, depress, dispirit him; also an untoward occurrence that produces the same effect. To _bewilder_ (Eng. prefix _be_, and Prov. Eng. _wildern_, a wilderness; Ger. _verwildern_, to render wild) implies a stronger action than either _to confound_ or _to confuse_, for it involves in addition to those distractions a sense of extreme perplexity, helplessness, stupefaction, such as would possess a person lost in a wilderness and not knowing which way to turn to get out. 

####abate 
**ABATE, LESSEN, DIMINISH, DECREASE.**  
_Abate_, from the French _abattre_, signified originally to beat down, in the active sense; to come down, in the neuter sense. _Diminish_, from the Latin _de_ and _minuere_, to lessen, and _minus_, less, expresses, like the verb _lessen_, the sense of either making less or becoming less. _Decrease_ is compounded of the privative _de_ and Latin _crescere_, to grow, signifying to grow less.  
_Abate, lessen_, and _diminish_ agree in the sense of becoming less and of making less; _decrease_ implies only becoming less. _Abate_ respects only vigor of action, and applies to that which is strong or violent, as a fever _abates_, pain, anger, etc., _abate; lessen_ and _diminish_ are applied to size, quantity, and number, but _lessen_ is much seldomer used intransitively than _diminish;_ things are rarely said to _lessen_ of themselves, but to _diminish._ The passion of an angry man ought to be allowed to _abate_ before any appeal is made to his understanding. Objects apparently _diminish_ as they recede from the view.  
_Abate_, transitively taken, signifies to bring down — _i.e._, to make less in height or degree by means of force or a particular effort, as to _abate_ pride or to _abate_ misery; _lessen_ and _diminish_, the former in the familiar, the latter in the grave style, signify to make less in quantity or magnitude by an ordinary process, as the size of a room is _lessened_, the credit of a person is _diminished._ We may _lessen_ the number of our evils by not dwelling upon them; nothing _diminishes_ the lustre of great deeds more than cruelty.  
To _decrease_ is to fall off; a retreating army will _decrease_ rapidly when, exposed to all the privations and hardships attendant on forced marches, it is compelled to fight for its safety; some things _decrease_ so gradually that it is some time before they are observed to be _diminished._  
The _decrease_ is the process, the _diminution_ is the result; as a _decrease_ in the taxes causes a _diminution_ in the revenue. The term _decrease_ is peculiarly applicable to material objects which can grow less, _diminution_ is applicable to objects generally which may become or be actually less from any cause.  
**TO REMIT, REBATE, DEDUCT, DECLINE, SLACKEN, SUBSIDE, SUPPRESS, SUBDUE, ALLOW, MITIGATE, ALLEVIATE, QUELL, CALM.** — _Remit, rebate, deduct_, and _allow_ are terms especially common in business transactions. A statement of an account is _remitted_, or sent, by the seller to the purchaser, and a specified discount or reduction in the amount of money called for in the statement is _remitted, rebated, deducted_, or _allowed_ by the seller for a cash payment within a designated period of time. To _decline, slacken, subside_ signify a decrease, a slowing-up, a settling. Stocks, bonds, commodities _decline_ in prices from time to time for various reasons; a person's health _declines_ as it becomes less vigorous than usual; winds, storms, and tides _slacken_ as they dimmish in severity and flow; and storms, disturbances, excitements, anxieties, alarms, fevers, and various physical conditions _subside_ as their causes are brought under control or eliminated. _Suppress, quell_, and _subdue_ are suggestive of riots and their ending; the crushing, overpowering, conquering of discordant or dangerous elements and conditions; all implying the use of force against force. _Subdue_ is the rather stronger term of the trio, for while a disturbance may be _suppressed_ or _quelled_, the resulting condition is not necessarily a finality, as the disturbance is liable to break out anew, whereas the elements of a disturbance that are _subdued_ are presumably forced into submission.  
A harsh legal sentence is _mitigated_ when its severity is reduced in consideration of extenuating circumstances; sickness and untoward conditions are _alleviated_ when made less painful or threatening. _Calm_ stands for. the most benevolent and inspiring condition in human life and nature, being indicative of peace, quiet, tranquillity, serenity, safety. A person, the ocean, the weather, the stock-markets, and countless activities are _calm_ when undisturbed.

####abettor 
**ABETTOR, ACCESSORY, ACCOMPLICE, CONFEDERATE.**  
_Abettor_, or one that abets, gives aid and encouragement by counsel, promises, or rewards. An _accessory_, or one added and annexed, takes an active, though subordinate, part. An _accomplice_, not related to _accomplish_, implies the principal in any plot, who takes a leading part and brings it to perfection. _Abettors_ propose, _accessories_ assist, _accomplices_ execute. The _abettor_ and _accessory_, or the _abettor_ and _accomplice_, may be one and the same person; but not so the _accessory_ and _accomplice._ In every deep-laid scheme there must be _abettors_ to set it on foot, _accessories_ to co-operate, and _accomplices_ to put it into execution; in the Gunpowder Plot there were many secret _abettors_, some noblemen who were _accessories_, and Guy Fawkes the principal _accomplice. Accomplice_, like the other terms, may be applied to other objects besides criminal offences. A _confederate_ assists in an undertaking, and _may_ do so openly or secretly, actively or passively. In criminal matters a _confederate_ is equally guilty with a principal. 

####abhor 
**ABHOR, DETEST, ABOMINATE, LOATHE.**  
These terms equally denote a sentiment of aversion. _Abhor_, in Latin _abhorreo_, compounded of _ab_, from, and _horrere_, to stiffen with horror, signifies to start from with a strong emotion of horror. _Detest_, in Latin _detestor_, compounded of _de_, from or against, and _tester_, I bear witness, signifies to condemn with indignation. _Abominate_, in Latin _abominatus_, participle of _abominor_, compounded of _ab_, from or against, and _ominor_, to fear something as being of ill omen, signifies to hold in religious abhorrence, to detest in the highest possible degree. _Loathe_, Anglo-Saxon _lathian_, is associated with the very common Anglo-Saxon adjective _lath_, hateful, and is allied with the German verb _leiden_, to suffer. It suggests a feeling of intense and even painful physical repulsion.  
What we _abhor_ is repugnant to our moral feelings; what we _detest_ is opposed to our moral principles; what we _abominate_ does violence to our religious and moral sentiments; what we _loathe_ offends our physical taste. We _abhor_ what is base and ungenerous, we _detest_ hypocrisy; we _abominate_ profanation and open impiety; we _loathe_ food when we are sick. In the moral acceptance _loathe_ is a strong figure of speech to mark the abhorrence and disgust which the sight or thought of offensive objects produces. 

####abide 
**ABIDE, SOJOURN, DWELL, LIVE, RESIDE, INHABIT.**  
_Abide_, in Anglo-Saxon _abidan_, signifies to await, to expect. _Sojourn_, in French _séjourner_, from _sub_ and _diurnus_, in the daytime, signifies to pass the _day_ — that is, a certain portion of one's time — in a place. _Dwell_ is from a Teutonic root meaning to wander, to lead astray, to tarry. This was the meaning of the Anglo-Saxon _dwellan;_ the present meaning of the word is a peculiar development in English paralleled only by some uses of the word in the Scandinavian tongues. At the present it implies a stay in a place by way of residence, which is expressed in common discourse by the word _live_, for passing one's life. _Reside_, from the Latin _re_ and _sedere_, to sit down, conveys the full idea of a settlement. _Inhabit_, from the Latin _habito_, a frequentative of _habeo_, signifies to have or occupy for a permanency.  
The length of stay implied in these terms is marked by a certain gradation. _Abide_ denotes the shortest stay; to _sojourn_ is of longer continuance; _dwell_ comprehends the idea of perpetuity in a given place, but _reside_ and _inhabit_ are partial and local — we _dwell_ only in one spot, but we may _reside_ at or _inhabit_ many places. These words have likewise a reference to the state of society. _Abide_ and _sojourn_ relate more properly to the wandering habits of men in a primitive state of society. _Dwell_, as implying a stay under a cover, is universal in its application; for we may _dwell_ either in a palace, a house, a cottage, or any shelter. _Live, reside_, and _inhabit_ are confined to a civilized state of society; the former applying to the abodes of the inferior orders, the latter to those of the higher classes. The word _inhabit_ is never used but in connection with the place _inhabited._  
The Easterners _abode_ with one another, _sojourned_ in a country, and _dwelt_ in tents. The angels _abode_ with Lot that night; Abram _sojourned_ in the land of Canaan; the Israelites _dwelt_ in the land of Goshen. Savages either _dwell_ in the cavities which nature has formed for them, or in some rude structure erected for a temporary purpose; but as men increase in cultivation they build places for themselves which they can _inhabit;_ the poor have their cottages in which they can _live;_ the wealthy provide themselves with superb buildings in which they _reside._

####ability 
**ABILITY, CAPACITY.**  
_Ability_, in French _habilité_, Latin _habilitas_, comes from _able, habile, habilis_, and _habeo_, to have, because possession and power are inseparable. _Capacity_, in French _capacité_, Latin _capacitas_, from _capax_ and _capio_, to receive, marks the abstract quality of being able to receive or hold.  
_Ability_ is to _capacity_ as the genus to the species. _Ability_ comprehends the power of doing in general, without specifying the quality or degree; _capacity_ is a particular kind of _ability. Ability_ may be either physical or mental; _capacity_, when said of persons, is mental only. _Ability_ respects action, _capacity_ respects thought. _Ability_ always supposes something able to be done; _capacity_ is a mental endowment, and always supposes something ready to receive or hold.  
_Ability_ is no wise limited in its extent; it may be small or great; _capacity_ of itself always implies a positive and superior degree of power, although it may be modified by epithets to denote different degrees; a boy of _capacity_ will have the advantage over his school-fellows, particularly if he be classed with those of a dull _capacity. Abilities_, when used in the plural only, is confined to the signification of mental endowments, and comprehends the operations of thought in general; _capacity_, on the other hand, is that peculiar endowment, that enlargement of understanding, that exalts the possessor above the rest of mankind. Many men have the _abilities_ for managing the concerns of others who would not have the _capacity_ for conducting a concern of their own. We should not judge highly of that man's _abilities_ who could only mar the plans of others, but had no _capacity_ for conceiving and proposing anything better in their stead.  
**ABILITY, FACULTY, TALENT.** — These terms all agree in denoting a power. _Ability_ is, as in the preceding case, the general term. _Faculty_, in Latin _facilitas_, changed from _facilitas_ and _facere_, to do, signifying an ability to do; and _talent_, in Latin _talentum_, a Greek coin exceeding one hundred pounds sterling, and employed figuratively, as in _Matthew_ 25, 15, for a gift, possession, or power — denote definite kinds of power.  
_Ability_ relates to human power generally, by which a man is enabled to act; it may vary in degree and quality with times, persons, and circumstances; health, strength, and fortune are _abilities; faculty_ is a gift of nature directed to a certain end and following a certain rule. An _ability_ may be acquired, and consequently is properly applied to individuals, an _ability_ to speak extempore or an _ability_ to write; but a _faculty_ belongs to the species, as a _faculty_ of speech or of hearing, etc.  
_Ability_ being in general the power of doing, may be applied in its unqualified sense to the whole species, without any distinction. _Faculty_ is always taken in a restricted sense, although applied to the species. _Faculty_ and _talent_ are both gifts of nature, but a _faculty_ is supposed to be given in an equal degree to all, a _talent_ in an unequal degree; as the _faculty_ of seeing, the _talent_ of mimics, the _talent_ for music; a _faculty_ may be impaired by age, disease, or other circumstances; a _talent_ is improved by exercise.  
As all these terms may be applied to different objects, they are aptly enough used in the plural to denote so many distinct powers: _abilities_ denote all our powers generally, corporeal and mental, but more especially the latter; _faculties_ relate to the ordinary powers of body and mind, as when we speak of a person's retaining or losing his _faculties; talents_ relate to the particular gifts or powers which may serve a beneficial purpose, as to employ one's _talents_ usefully.  
**ABILITY, DEXTERITY, ADDRESS.** — _Ability_ is, as before observed, a general term, without any qualification. _Dexterity_, from _dexter_, the right hand, signifying mechanical or manual facility, and _address_, signifying a mode of address, are particular terms. _Ability_ may be used to denote any degree, as to do according to the best of one's _ability;_ and it may be qualified to denote a small degree of _ability. Dexterity_ and _address_ are positive degrees of _ability. Ability_ is, however, frequently taken in a restricted sense for a positive degree of _ability_, winch brings it still nearer to the two other terms, from which it differs only in the application; _ability_ in this case refers to intellectual endowment generally, _dexterity_ relates to a particular power or facility of executing, and _address_ to a particular mode or manner of addressing one's self on particular occasions. _Ability_ shows itself in the most important transactions and the general conduct in the highest stations, as a minister of state displays his _ability; dexterity_ and _address_ are employed occasionally, the former in removing difficulties and escaping dangers, the latter in improving advantages and accommodating tempers; the former in directing the course of things, the latter in managing of men.  
**ABLE, CAPABLE, CAPACIOUS.** — These epithets, from which the preceding abstract nouns are derived, have distinctions peculiar to themselves. _Able_ and _capable_ are applied to ordinary actions, but not always indifferently, the one for the other: _able_ is said of the abilities generally, as a child is _able_ or not _able_ to walk; _capable_ is said of one's ability to do particular things, as to be _capable_ of performing a great journey. _Able_ is said of that which one can do, as to be _able_ to write or read; _capable_ is said of that which either a person or a thing can take, receive, or hold; a person is _capable_ of an office, or _capable_ of great things; a thing is _capable_ of improvement. _Able_ may be added to a noun by way of epithet when it denotes a positive degree of ability, as an _able_ commander, an _able_ financier. _Capable_ may be used absolutely to express a mental power.  
_Capable_ and _capacious_, though derived from the same verb _capio_, to take or receive, are distinguished from each other in respect to the powers or properties of the objects to which they are applied, _capable_ being said of powers generally, _capacious_ only of the property of having amplitude of space or a power to take in or comprehend; and men are _capable_ of thought or reason, of life or death, etc.; a hall may be said to be _capacious_, or, figuratively, a man has a _capacious_ mind. 

####abiogenic 
**ABIOGENIC, LIFELESS, SOURCELESS.**  
_Abiogenic_ is a recently coined word that has no real synonyms; _abiogenic_, the adjective of _abiogenesis_, a compound of the Greek _a_, without, _βιός_, life, and _γένεσις_, origin, invented by Huxley, signifies, literally, spontaneous generation, the opposite of sexual generation and _biogenesis_ (which see). _Abiogenic_ pertains to the production of life or living beings under certain physical conditions without the intervention of antecedent living forms, Huxley having propounded the theory that living matter can be produced from that which in itself is not living matter. Hence, it is claimed, as the basis of _abiogenesis_, that certain material objects may be developed from other objects that in themselves are _lifeless_ and, as far as known, _sourceless._  
Biologists at one time held the view that some of the lower animals or plants, or the primordial of one or the other, or both, of the animal and vegetable kingdoms may have sprung from _lifeless_ matter without the intervention of any previously existing parent. On the demonstration that alleged instances of such spontaneous generation were unfounded, the early view was discarded till Haeckel and other evolutionists revived it and Huxley gave it a name. 

####abjure 
**ABJURE, RECANT, RETRACT, RECALL, REVOKE.**  
_Abjure_, in Latin _abjuro_, is compounded of the privative 06 and _juro_, swear, signifying to swear to the contrary, or give up with an oath. _Recant_, in Latin _recanto_, is compounded of the privative _re_ and _canto_, to sing or declare, signifying to unsay, to contradict by a counter declaration. _Retract_, in Latin _retractus_, participle of _retraho_, is compounded of _re_, back, and _traho_, to draw, signifying to draw back what has been let go. _Revoke_ and _recall_ have the same original sense as _recant_, with this difference only, that the word _call_, which is expressed also by _voke_, or in Latin _voco_, implies an action more suited to a multitude than the word _canto_, to sing, which may pass in solitude. We _abjure_ a religion, we _recant_ a doctrine, we _retract_ a promise, we _revoke_ a command, we _recall_ an expression, and, where the initiative, referendum, and recall prevail, an incompetent or unfaithful official.  
What has been solemnly professed is renounced by _abjuration;_ what has been publicly maintained as a settled point of belief is as publicly given up by _recanting;_ what has been pledged so as to gain credit is contradicted by _retracting;_ what has been pronounced by an act of authority is rendered null by _revocation;_ what has been misspoken through inadvertence or mistake is rectified by _recalling_ the words.  
Although Archbishop Cranmer _recanted_ the principles of the Reformation, yet he soon after _recalled_ his words, and died boldly for his faith. Henry IV. of France _abjured_ Calvinism, but he did not _retract_ the promise which he had made to the Calviniste of his protection. Louis XIV. drove many of his best subjects from France by _revoking_ the Edict of Nantes. Interest but too often leads men to _abjure_ their faith; the fear of shame or punishment leads them to _recant_ their opinions; the want of principle dictates the _retracting_ of one's promise; reasons of state occasion the _revoking_ of decrees; a love of precision commonly induces a speaker or writer to _recall_ a false expression. " 

####abolish 
**ABOLISH, ABROGATE, REPEAL, REVOKE, ANNUL, CANCEL.**  
_Abolish_, in French _abolir_, Latin _abolere_, to grow less, is compounded of _ab_, away, and _olere_, to grow. _Abrogate_, in French _abroger_, Latin _abrogatus_, participle of _abrogo_, compounded of _ab_, away, and _rogare_, to ask, signifies to ask away, or to ask that a thing may be done away; in allusion to the custom of the Romans, among whom no law was valid unless the consent of the people was obtained by asking, and in like manner no law was unmade without asking their consent. _Repeal_, in French _rappeller_, from the Latin words _re_ and _appello_, signifies literally to call back or unsay what has been said, which is in like manner the original meaning of _revoke. Annul_, in French _annuller_, comes from Latin _nullus, ne-ullus_, not any, signifying to reduce to nothing. _Cancel_, in French _canceller_, comes from the Latin _cancello_, cut crosswise, signifying to strike out crosswise — that is, to cross out.  
The word _abolish_ conveys the idea of putting a total end to a thing, and is applied properly to those things which have been long in existence and firmly established: an _abolition_ may be effected either by an act of power, as to _abolish_ an institution or an order of men, and the like. Or it may be a gradual act, or effected by indirect means, as to _abolish_ a custom, practice, etc.  
All the other terms have respect to the partial acts of men, in undoing that which they have done. Laws are either _repealed_ or _abrogated_, but _repealing_ is a term of modern use, applied to the acts of public councils or assemblies, where laws are made or unmade by the consent or open declaration of numbers. _Abrogate_ is a term of less definite import; to _abrogate_ a law is to render it null by any act of the legislature; thus, the making of a new law may _abrogate_ the old one.  
_Revoking_ is an act of individual authority — edicts are _revoked; annulling_ is an act of discretion, as official proceedings or private contracts are _annulled; cancelling_ is a species of annulling, as in the case of _cancelling_ deeds, bonds, obligations, etc. None can _abrogate_ but those who have the power to make. Any one who has the power to give his word may also _revoke_ it, if he see reason so to do. Any one who can bind himself or others, by any deed or instrument, may _annul_ or render this null and void, provided it be done for a reasonable cause, and in the proper manner. As _cancelling_ serves to blot out or obliterate what has been written, it may be applied to what is blotted out of the memory. It is a voluntary resignation of right or demand which one person has upon another. 

####abominable 
**ABOMINABLE, DETESTABLE, EXECRABLE.**  
The primitive idea of these terms, agreeable to their derivation (for which see [abominate](entry://abominate), MALEDICTION, and DETEST), is that of badness in the highest degree; conveying by themselves the strongest signification, and excluding the necessity for every other modifying epithet.  
The _abominable_ thing excites aversion; the _detestable_ thing, hatred and revulsion; the _execrable_ thing, indignation and horror.  
These sentiments are expressed against what is _abominable_ by strong ejaculations, against what is _detestable_ by animadversion and reprobation, and against what is _execrable_ by imprecations and anathemas.  
In the ordinary acceptation of these terms, they serve to mark a degree of excess in a very bad thing; _abominable_ expressing less than _detestable_, and that less than _execrable._ This gradation is sufficiently illustrated in the following example. Dionysius, the tyrant, having been informed that a very aged woman prayed to the gods every day for his preservation, and wondering that any of his subjects should be so interested for his safety, inquired of this woman respecting the motives of her conduct, to which she replied, "In my infancy I lived under an _abominable_ prince, whose death I desired; but when he perished, he was succeeded by a _detestable_ tyrant worse than himself. I offered up my vows for his death also, which were in like manner answered; but we have since had a worse tyrant than he. This _execrable_ monster is yourself, whose life I have prayed for, lest, if it be possible, you should be succeeded by one even more wicked. "  
The exaggeration conveyed by these expressions has given rise to their abuse in vulgar discourse, where they are often employed indifferently to serve the humor of the speaker.

####above 
**ABOVE, OVER, UPON, BEYOND.**  
When an object is _above_ another, it exceeds it in height; when it is _over_ another, it extends along its superior surface; when it is _upon_ another, it comes in contact with its superior surface; when it is _beyond_ another, it lies at a greater distance. Trees frequently grow _above_ a wall, and sometimes the branches hang _over_ the wall, or rest _upon_ it, but they seldom stretch much _beyond it._ In the figurative sense, the first is mostly employed to convey the idea of superiority; the second, of authority; the third, of immediate influence; and the fourth, of extent. Every one should be above falsehood, but particularly those who are set _over_ others, who may have an influence _on_ their minds _beyond_ all calculation. 

####abridge 
**ABRIDGE, ABBREVIATE, CURTAIL, CONTRACT.**  
_Abridge_, in French _abréger_, Latin _abbreviare_, is compounded of the intensive syllable _ab_ and _breviare_, from _brevis_, short, signifying to make short. _Abridge_ and _abbreviate_, by derivation, have therefore exactly the same meaning, though they are used in different connections. We _abbreviate_ a word; we _abridge_ a book. _Curtail_, in French _court_, short, and _tailler_, to cut, signifies to diminish in length by cutting. _Contract_, in Latin _contractus_, participle of _contraho_, is compounded of _con_ and _traho_, signifying to draw close together.  
By _abridging_, in the figurative as well as the literal sense, the quantity is diminished; by _curtailing_, the measure or number is reduced; by _contracting_, the compass is reduced. Privileges are _abridged_, pleasures _curtailed_, and powers _contracted._ It is ungenerous to _abridge_ the liberty of any one, or _curtail_ him of lus advantages, while he makes no improper use of them; otherwise it is advisable, in order to _contract_ his means of doing mischief.

**ABRIDGMENT, COMPENDIUM, EPITOME, DIGEST, SUMMARY, ABSTRACT.** — The first four terms are applied to a distinct work, the two latter to parts of a work.  
An _abridgment_ is the reduction of a work into a smaller compass. A _compendium_ is a general and concise view of any science, as geography or astronomy. An _epitome_ is a compressed view of all the substantial parts of a thing, or, in other words, the whole of any matter brought into a small compass. A _digest_ is any materials digested in order. A _summary_ comprehends the heads and subdivisions of a work. An _abstract_ includes a brief but comprehensive view of any particular proceeding. _Abridgments_ often surpass the originals in values when they are made with judgment. _Compendiums_ are fitted for young persons to commit to memory on commencing the study of any science. There is perhaps not a better _epitome_ than that of the Universal History by Bossuet, nor a better _digest_ than that of the laws made by order of Justinian. Systematic writers give occasional _summaries_ of what they have been treating upon. It is necessary to make _abstracts_ of deeds or judicial proceedings. _Epitome_ and _abstract_ are taken for other objects, which contain within a small compass the essence of a thing.

####abrupt 
**ABRUPT, RUGGED, ROUGH.**  
_Abrupt_, in Latin _abruptus_, participle of _abrumpere_, to break off, signifies the state of being broken off. _Rugged_ is a Scandinavian word signifying hairy, hence unshaven, rough. _Rough_, from Anglo-Saxon _run_, hairy, rough, had the same meaning and development.  
These words mark different degrees of unevenness. What is _abrupt_ has greater cavities and protuberances than what is _rugged;_ what is _rugged_ has greater irregularities than what is _rough._ In the natural sense _abrupt_ is _opposed_ to what is unbroken, _rugged_ to what is even, and _rough_ to what is smooth. A precipice is _abrupt_, a path is _rugged_, a plank is _rough._ The _abruptness_ of a body is generally occasioned by a violent concussion and separation of its parts; _ruggedness_ arises from natural, but less violent, causes; _roughness_ is mostly a natural property, although sometimes produced by friction.  
In the figurative or extended application, the distinction is equally clear. Words and manners are _abrupt_ when they are sudden and unconnected; the temper is _rugged_ which is exposed to frequent ebullitions of angry humor; actions are _rough_ when performed with violence and incaution. An _abrupt_ behavior is the consequence of an agitated mind; a _rugged_ disposition is inherent in the character; a _rough_ deportment arises from an undisciplined state of feeling. An habitual steadiness and coolness of reflection is best fitted to prevent or correct any _abruptness_ of manner; a cultivation of the Christian temper cannot fail of smoothing down all _ruggedness_ of humor; an intercourse with polished society will inevitably refine down all _roughness_ of behavior.

####abscond 
**ABSCOND, STEAL AWAY, SECRETE ONE'S SELF. **  
_Abscond_, in Latin _abscondo_, is compounded of _abs_ and _condo_, signifying to hide from the view, which is the original meaning of the other words; to _abscond_ is to remove one's self for the sake of not being discovered by those with whom we are acquainted. To _steal away_ is to get away so as to elude observation. To _secrete one's self_ is to get into a place of secrecy without being perceived. Dishonest men _abscond_, thieves _steal away_ when they dread detection, and fugitives _secrete themselves._ Those who _abscond_ will have frequent occasion to _steal away_, and still more frequent occasion to _secrete themselves._

####absent 
**ABSENT, ABSTRACTED, ABSTRACT, DIVERTED, DISTRACTED.**  
_Absent_, in French _absent_, Latin _absens_, comes from 06, from, and _sum_, to be, signifying away or at a distance from all objects. _Abstracted_, or _abstract_, in French _abstrait_, Latin _abstractus_, participle of _abstraho_, or _abs_, from, and _traho_, to draw, signifies drawn or separated from all objects. _Diverted_, in French _divertir_, Latin _diverto_, compounded of _dis_, asunder, and _vertere_, to turn, signifies turned aside from the object that is present. _Distracted_, of course, implies drawn asunder, by different objects.  
A want of proper attention is implied in all these terms, but in different degrees and under different circumstances. _Absence_ of mind is either a state or a habit; a man may be occasionally _absent._ Or a man may contract an habitual _absence_, either from profound study, or from any other less commendable cause. _Abstraction_ denotes a state, and, for the most part, a temporary state.  
The term _absent_ simply implies not present with one's mind, not observant of present objects, but it does not necessarily imply thinking of anything; a man man be _absent_ who is thinking of nothing.  
_Abstracted_, on the other hand, denotes deep thought of something not present. _Abstract_ may in poetry be used in the sense of _abstracted. Absent_ and _abstracted_ denote an exclusion of present objects; _diverted_ and _distracted_, a misapplied attention to present objects, or to such objects as do not demand attention. An _absent_ man never has his body and mind in the same place; the _abstracted_ man is lost in thinking; a man who is easily _diverted_ seeks to take an interest in every passing object; a _distracted_ man is unable to think properly of anything: it may be good to be sometimes _diverted._ It is bad at any time to be _distracted_, particularly when it arises from passion. 

####absolute 
**ABSOLUTE, DESPOTIC, ARBITRARY, TYRANNICAL.**  
_Absolute_, in Latin _absolutus_, participle of _absolvo_, signifies absolved or set at liberty from all restraint as it regards persons; unconditional, unlimited, as it regards things. _Despotic_, from _despot_, in Greek _δεσπότης_, a master or lord (the same root appears in the word _potent)_, implies being like a lord, uncontrolled. _Arbitrary_, in French _arbitraire_, from the Latin _arbitror_, act as an umpire, decide, implies independence of judgment and will. _Tyrannical_ signifies being like a tyrant.  
_Absolute_ power is independent of and superior to all other power: an _absolute_ monarch is uncontrolled not only by men, but things; he is above all law except what emanates from himself. When this absolute power is assigned to any one according to the constitution of a government, it is _despotic. Despotic_ power is therefore something less than _absolute_ power; a prince is _absolute_ of himself; he is _despotic_ by the consent of others. In the early ages of society monarchs were _absolute_, and among the Eastern nations they still retain the _absolute_ form of government, though much limited by established usage. In the more civilized stages of society the power of _despots_ has been considerably restricted by prescribed laws, in so much that _despotism_ is now classed among the regular forms of government.  
_Absolute_ is a term of a general application in the sense of _absolved_ or freed from all control or limit; in this sense God is said to be absolute. Sometimes it is applied either to the power itself or to the exercise of power, as _absolute_ rule or dominion; _despotic_ is likewise applied to the exercise of the power as well as the power itself, as _despotic_ sway; _arbitrary_ and _tyrannical_ are used only in this last application: the latter is always taken in a bad sense, the former sometimes in an indifferent sense. With _arbitrariness_ is associated the idea of caprice and selfishness. With _tyranny_ is associated the idea of oppression and injustice. Among the Greeks the word _τύραννος_, a tyrant, implied no more than what we now understand by _despot_, or, more properly, one who gained the supreme power in a republic; but from the natural abuse of such power, it has acquired the signification now attached to it, namely, of exercising power to the injury of another. If _absolute_ power come into the hands of any one man or body of men, it is fair to expect that it will be used arbitrarily. In _despotic_ governments the _tyrannical_ proceedings of the subordinate officers are often more intolerable than those of the prince. 

####absolution 
See [forgive](entry://forgive)

####absolve 
**ABSOLVE, ACQUIT.**  
_Absolve_, in Latin _absolve_, is compounded of _ab_, from, and _solvere_, to loose, signifying to loose from that with which one is bound. _Acquit_, in French _acquitter_, is compounded of the intensive syllable _ac_ or _ad_, and _quit, quitter_, from Latin _quietus_, quiet, signifying to make easy by the removal of a charge.  
These terms imply the setting free from guilt or its consequences. _Absolving_ may sometimes be applied to offences against the laws of man, but more frequently to offences against God; _acquitting_ applies solely to offences against man. The conscience is released by _absolution;_ the body, goods, or reputation are set free by an _acquittal._  
See also [forgive](entry://forgive)  
**ABSOLVE, ACQUIT, CLEAR.** — _Absolve_ in this case, as distinguished from the former article, is extended to all matters affecting the conscience generally. _Acquit_ and _clear_, in the sense of making _clear_ or free from, are applied to everything which may call for blame, or the imputation of what is not right. A person may be _absolved_ from his oath,_ acquitted_ or pronounced quit of every charge, and _cleared_ from every imputation. 

####absorb 
**ABSORB, SWALLOW UP, INGULF, ENGROSS, IMBIBE.**  
_Absorb_, French _absorber_ Latin _absorbeo_, is compounded of _ab_ and _sorbeo_, to sup up, in distinction from _swallow up_ — the former denoting a gradual consumption; the latter, a sudden envelopment of the whole object. The excessive heat of the sun _absorbs_ all the nutritious fluids of bodies, animal and vegetable. The gamingtable is a vortex in which the principle of every man is _swallowed up_ with his estate. _Ingulf_, compounded of _in_ and _gulf_, signifies to be enclosed in a great gulf, which is a strong figurative representation for being swallowed up. As it applies to grand and sublime objects, it is used only in the higher style.  
_Engross_, which is compounded of the French words _en gros_, whole, signifies to purchase wholesale, so as to swallow up the profits of others. In the moral application therefore it is very analogous to _absorb._ The mind is _absorbed_ in the contemplation of any subject when all its powers are so bent upon it as not to admit distraction. The mind is _engrossed_ by any subject when the thoughts of it force themselves upon its contemplation to the exclusion of others which should engage the attention.  
_Absorb_ conveys the idea not only of talcing from something, but also of taking to itself; _engross_ conveys the idea of taking to itself, to the exclusion of others; a certain subject _absorbs_ the faculties, and, metaphorically, the roots of plants _absorb_ moisture; a person _engrosses_ the conversation so that others cannot take part in it.  
_Absorb_, and _imbibe_, from _in_ and _bibo_, to drink, both imply the taking in by a gradual process; but the former includes the idea of being taken in so as to be lost, the latter that of being taken in so as to form a part of that by which it is received. So in the improper application, an idea _absorbs_ the mind, and the mind _imbibes_ the idea.

####abstain 
**ABSTAIN, FORBEAR, REFRAIN.**  
_Abstain_, in French _abstenir_, Latin _abstineo_ is compounded of _ab_ or _abs_, from, and _tenere_, to keep, signifying to keep one's self from a thing. _Forbear_ is compounded of the preposition for, or from, and the verb to bear or carry, signifying to carry or take one's self from a thing. _Refrain_, in French _refréner_, Latin _refrœno_, is compounded of _re_, back, and _frœnum_, a bridle, signifying to keep back as it were by a bridle, to bridle in.  
All these terms imply the omission to do anything, but vary in the circumstances and in the motives for the omission. To _abstain_ is the general term, to _forbear_ and _refrain_ are particular modes of _abstaining. Abstaining_ is an act that may require no self-denial, nor oppose any inclination; _forbearing_ and _refraining_ both imply a certain degree of opposition to the will or inclination, the latter much more than the former. We _abstain_ from doing indifferent things from motives of convenience, as to _abstain_ from speaking upon a particular subject, or we _abstain_ from important matters from a sense of duty, as "to _abstain_ from the appearance of evil. " We _forbear_ from prudence or duty to do that which we have motives for doing; as we _forbear_ to do an injury though in return for an injury. We _refrain_, from the same motives, from doing that which we are strongly inclined or impelled to do, as to _refrain_ from expressing the feelings of the moment.  
These words are often coupled with a negative, to show the inability of the agent to omit doing a thing, as when it is said, "I cannot _abstain_ from the gratification, '' or "I cannot _forbear_ mentioning, " etc., or "she was so affected that she could not _refrain"_ from tears.  
_Abstaining_ as a religious duty is mostly said of indulgences as to food or otherwise which are prohibited; as it is the part of the Mohammedan faith to _abstain_ from wine; _forbearing_ is mostly said of that which concerns others. Every one is too liable to offend, not to have motives for _forbearing_ to deal harshly with the offences of others; for being patient, indulgent, long-suffering.  
**ABSTINENCE, FAST, ABSTINENT, SOBER, ABSTEMIOUS, TEMPERATE.** — _Abstinence_ is a general term, applicable to any object from which we abstain; _fast_ is a species of _abstinence_, namely, an _abstaining_ from food. The general term is likewise used in the particular sense, to imply a partial _abstinence_ from particular food; but _fast_ signifies an abstinence from food altogether.  
_Abstinent_ respects everything that acts on the senses, and in a limited sense applies particularly to solid food. _Sober_, from the Latin _sobrius_, compounded of so or _se_, expressing separation (cf. _se_ in separation) and _ebrius_, drunk, implies an abstinence from excessive drinking. _Absternious_, from the Latin _abstemius_, compounded of _abs_ and _temelum_, wine, implies the abstaining from wine or strong liquor in general. _Temperate_, in Latin _temperatus_, participle of _tempero_, to moderate or regulate, implies a well-regulated abstinence in all manner of sensual indulgence.  
The first of the last four terms is generic, the rest specific. We may be _abstinent_ without being _sober, sober_ without being _abstemious_, and all together without being _temperate._ An _abstinent_ man does not eat or drink as much as he could enjoy; a _sober_ man may drink much without being affected; an _abstemious_ man drinks nothing strong; a _temperate_ man enjoys all in a due proportion. A particular passion may cause us to be _abstinent_ either partially or totally; _sobriety_ may often depend upon the strength of the constitution, or be prescribed by prudence: necessity may dictate _abstemiousness_, but nothing short of a well-disciplined mind will enable us to be _temperate._

####abstract 
**ABSTRACT, SEPARATE, DISTINGUISH.**  
_Abstract_, see [abridge](entry://abridge); [absent](entry://absent). _Separate_, in Latin _separatus_, participle of _separo_, is compounded of _se_, apart, and _parare_, to dispose, signifying to put things asunder, or at a distance from each other. _Distinguish_, in French _distinguer_, Latin _distinguo_, is compounded of the separative preposition _dis_ and a root which appears in the Greek _στίγγω_, prick, and in the English _sting, stick_, etc. It may signify the giving of different marks to things, by which they may be known from each other.  
_Abstract_, as compared with the other terms, is used in the moral sense only; _separate_ mostly in a physical sense: _distinguish_ either in a moral or physical sense; we _abstract_ what we wish to regard particularly and individually; we _separate_ what we wish not to be united; we _distinguish_ what we wish not to confound. The mind performs the office of _abstraction_ for itself; _separating_ and _distinguishing_ are exerted on external objects. Arrangements, place, time, and circumstances serve to _separate:_ the ideas formed of things, the outward marks attached to them, the qualities attributed to them, serve to _distinguish._ By the operation of _abstraction_ the mind creates for itself a multitude of new ideas; in the act of _separation_ bodies are removed from each other by distance of place; in the act of _distinguishing_ objects are discovered to be similar or dissimilar. Qualities are _abstracted_ from the subjects in which they are inherent; countries are _separaleaoy_ mountains or seas; their inhabitants are _distinguished_ by their dress, language, or maimers. The mind is never less _abstracted_ from one's friends than when _separated_ from them by immense oceans; it requires a keen eye to _distinguish_ objects that bear a great resemblance to each other. Volatile persons easily _abstract_ their minds from the most solemn scenes to fix them on trifling objects that pass before them: an unsocial temper leads some men to _separate_ themselves from all their companions: an absurd ambition leads others to _distinguish_ themselves by their eccentricities.  
See also **abridgment** under [abridge](entry://abridge)  
**ABSTRACTED, ABSTRACT, ABSTRACTION, ALIENATION, ESTRANGEMENT.** — _Abstracted_, as in the former case (see [absent](entry://absent)), is properly applied to persons or things personal. _Abstract_, which is but a contraction of the former, is most commonly used to denote the qualities of things. A person is said to be _abstracted_ who is in a state of _abstraction;_ or a person may lead an _abstracted_ life or course of life, or follow an abstracted theory, when the mind is altogether _abstracted_ from external or sensible objects; a thing is said to be abstract which is formed by the operation of _abstraction_ or _abstracted_ thinking, as an _abstract_ idea, which is _abstracted_ or separated by the mind from the objects to which they belong or inhere; whiteness is an _abstract_ idea, because it is conceived in the mind _abstracted_ from snow, a wall, or any other substance that is white.  
_Abstraction_ expresses the state of being abstracted as to one's mind or person from any object generally. _Alienation_, the state of being alienated as to one's affections from others. _Estrangement_, the state of being a stranger is unknown to others. _Abstraction_ expresses less than _alienation_ or _estrangement;_ it is simply the abstaining to take a part with others in any matter, as an _abstraction_ from the world, its cares, pursuits, and pleasures. _Alienation_ and _estrangement_ both suppose an altered state of mind toward any object; _alienation_ is where the heart and affections become alien or strange to that on which they have been or ought to be fixed; _estrangement_ is where the person becomes distant from that with which one has been or ought to be intimate. One is said to be _abstracted_ from the thing, but _alienated_ or _estranged_ from the person or the thing.

####abuse 
**ABUSE, MISUSE**  
_Abuse_, in Latin _abusus_, participle of _abutor_, compounded of _ab_, from, and _utor_, to use, signifies to use away or wear away with using; in distinction from _misuse_, which signifies to use amiss.  
Everything is _abused_ which receives any sort of injury; it is _misused_ if not used at all, or turned to a wrong use. Young people are too prone to _abuse_ books for want of setting a proper value on their contents; they do not always avoid _misusing_ them in their riper years, when they read for amusement only instead of improvement. Money is _abused_ when it is clipped or its value any way lessened; it is _misused_ when it is spent in excess and debauchery.  
**ABUSE, INVECTIVE.** — _Abuse_ is here taken in the metaphorical application for ill-treatment of persons by the use of harsh words. _Invective_, from the Latin _inveho_, signifies to bear upon or, in modern slang, to "sail into. " Harsh and unseemly censure is the idea common to these terms; but the former is employed more properly against the person, the latter against the thing. _Abuse_ is addressed to the individual, and mostly by word of mouth; _invective_ is communicated mostly by writing. _Abuse_ is dictated by anger, which throws off all constraint and violates all decency; _invective_ is dictated by party spirit, or an intemperate warmth of feeling in matters of opinion. _Abuse_ is always resorted to by the vulgar in their private quarrels; _invective_ is the ebullition of zeal and ill-nature in public concerns. The more rude and ignorant the man, the more liable he is to indulge in _abuse;_ the more restless and opinionated the partisans, whether in religion or politics, the more ready he is to deal in _invective._

####academic 
**ACADEMIC, CLASSIC, SCHOLASTIC, PEDANTIC.**  
These words all refer to formal learning, but there is a difference in their origin and their application. _Academic_ is derived from Greek _ακαδημέια_, the name of the garden or grove where Plato taught. It referred at first to Plato's school, and then became a general designation. _Academic_, therefore, means according to the methods of the schools, and is sometimes used in a good sense with reference to the life of the scholar in the universities, and sometimes in a derogatory sense to characterize that which merely originates in books, and is unrelated to practical experience. _Classic_, from Latin _classis_, meant originally of the highest class, and referred especially to the works of the Greek and Latin authors as being the highest types of literature. It is usually contrasted with _modem_ and _natural_, as _academic_ is contrasted with _practical._ In a general way, therefore, it is associated with the idea conveyed in _academic_, though not strictly synonymous with it. _Scholastic_, Latin _scholasticus_ (from Greek _σχoλάζειν_, to devote one's leisure to learning, from _σχολή_, leisure), refers especially to the scholars of the Middle Ages, called the _scholastic_ philosophers. It means characterized by the methods of the schools, with special reference to logical procedure and minute analysis. _Pedantic_, from Italian _pédante_, a schoolmaster or _pedagogue_, comes from Greek _παιδεύειν_, to instruct youth, and means characteristic of the schoolmaster. It is used in a derogatory sense to characterize barren learning.

**ACCEPTABLE, GRATEFUL, WELCOME.**  
_Acceptable_ signifies worthy to be accepted. _Grateful_, from the Latin _grains_, pleasing, signifies altogether pleasing; it is that which recommends itself. The _acceptable_ is a relative good; the _grateful_ is positive; the former depends upon our external condition, the latter on our feelings and taste; a gift is _acceptable_ to a poor man, which would be refused by one less needy than himself; harmonious sounds are always _grateful_ to a musical ear.  
_Welcome_ signifies come well or in season for us. _Acceptable_ and _welcome_ both apply to external circumstances, and are therefore relatively employed but the former is confined to such things as are offered for our choice, the latter refers to whatever happens according to our wishes; we may not always accept that which is _acceptable_ but we shall never reject that which is _welcome;_ it is an insult to offer anything by way of a gift to another which is not _acceptable;_ it is a _grateful_ task to be the bearer of _welcome_ intelligence to our friends.  
**ACCEPTANCE, ACCEPTATION.** — Though both derived from the verb _accept_, these terms have this difference, that the former is employed to express the active sense of the verb, the latter the passive sense. _Acceptance_ is the act of accepting, _acceptation_ the state _of_ being accepted, as the _acceptance_ of a favor lays a person under an obligation. A book, or whatever else is offered to us, may be worthy of our _acceptance_ or not; a word acquires its _acceptation_ from the manner in which it is generally accepted by the learned

####accident 
**ACCIDENT, CHANCE.**  
_Accident_, in Latin _accidens_, from _ad_ and _cadens_, falling, and _chance_ (in French _chance_, also connected with _cadens)_, both signify falling out (cf. English _befall) — i.e._, without any design; but the former, by the force of the _ac_ or _ad_, signifies falling out at a given time, or under given circumstances; _chance_, on the other hand, signifies falling out without any qualification or restriction. Both may be employed to denote either the manner or cause of things happening, or the things themselves that so happen; in the first sense, _accident_ and _chance_ may be used indifferently in the colloquial expressions to happen by _chance_ or by _accident_, but otherwise _accident_ is used only in respect to particular events as, it was pure _accident;_ -but _chance_ is employed to denote a hidden senseless cause of things, as opposed to a positive intelligent cause. Atheists ascribe all things to _chance;_ whatever happens by secondary causes hidden from our view we are accustomed to ascribe to _chance_, which is only a mode of confessing our ignorance as to how it happens.  
When taken for the thing that happens, _accident_ is said ordinarily of things that have been; _chance_ of things that are to be. That is an _accident_ which is done without intention; that is a _chance_ which cannot be brought about by the use of means. It is an _accident_ when a house falls; it is a _chance_ when and how it may fall. _Accidents_ cannot be prevented; _chances_ cannot be calculated upon. _Accidents_ may sometimes be remedied; _chances_ can never be controlled. _Accidents_ give rise to sorrow; they mostly occasion mischief: _chances_ give rise to hope; they often produce disappointment; it is wise to dwell upon neither.  
Sometimes _chance_ is used without reference to time for any fortuitous event, and in that case it is more expressive than the word _accident._ The term _accident_ may likewise sometimes be taken for what may happen in the future.

**ACCIDENT, CONTINGENCY, CASUALTY, ACCIDENTAL, INCIDENTAL, CASUAL, CONTINGENT.** — _Accident_ (see above). _Contingency_, in French _contingence_, Latin _contingent_, participle of _contingo_, compounded of _con_, together, and _tangere_, to touch one another, signifies the falling out or happening together, or the thing that happens in conjunction with another. _Casualty_, in French _casualité_, from the Latin _casualis_, and _cado_, to fall or happen, signifies the thing that happens in the course of events.  
All these words imply whatever takes place independently of our intentions. _Accidents_ express more than _contingencies;_ the former comprehend events with their causes and consequences; the latter respect collateral actions, or circumstances appended to events; _casualties_ have regard simply to circumstances. _Accidents_ are frequently occasioned by carelessness, and _contingencies_ by trivial mistakes; but _casualties_ are altogether independent of ourselves. The overturning of a carriage is an _accident;_ our situation in a carriage at the time is a _contingency_, which may occasion us to be more or less hurt; the passing of any one at the time is a _casualty._ We are all exposed to the most calamitous _accidents_, and our happiness or misery depends upon a thousand _contingencies;_ the best-concerted schemes may be thwarted by _casualties_, which no human foresight can prevent.  
_Accidental_, see under ACCIDENT. _Incidental_, from _incident_, in Latin _incidens_ and _incido_, or _in_, on, and _cadere_, to fall upon, signifies belonging to a tiling by chance. _Casual_, see [casualty ](entry://casualty )above. _Contingent_, see [contingency ](entry://contingency )above.  
_Accidental_ is opposed to what is designed or planned; _incidental_ to what is premeditated; _casual_ to what is constant and regular; _contingent_ to what is definite and fixed. A meeting may be _accidental_, an expression _incidental_, a look, expression, etc., _casual_, an expense or circumstance _contingent._ We do not expect what is _accidental;_ we do not suspect or guard against what is _incidental;_ we do not heed what is _casual;_ we are not prepared for what is _contingent._ Many of the most fortunate and important occurrences in our lives are _accidental;_ many remarks, seemingly _incidental_, do in reality conceal a settled intent; a _casual_ remark in the course of conversation will sometimes make a stronger impression on the minds of children than the most eloquent and impressive discourse or repeated counsel; in the prosecution of any plan we ought to be prepared for the numerous _contingencies_ which we. may meet with to interfere with our arrangements.

####accommodator 
**ACCOMMODATOR, ASSISTANT, HELPER.**  
_Accommodator_, from the Latin _accommodatus_ or _accommoda_, that from _ad_, to, and _commodo_, to adapt, signifies, literally, one who accommodates another, who adapts himself or herself to the wishes of another. While the accommodation may be rendered in any desired direction, the term _accommodator_ has recently taken on a new application, and now implies a man or woman who makes a business of hiring out by the hour or day to render whatever assistance or help a housewife may require.  
_Assistant_ (for the derivation see _assist_ under HELP) has a less specialized meaning. It designates any one whose office it is to aid another in his work _— assistant_ secretary, _assistant_ editor, _assistant_ to the president, etc. _Helper_ is more colloquial and informal. We speak of the helpers in any regularly organized business office as _assistants_, but an assistant in certain household duties is often called a "mother's _helper, "_ and country people speak of their "hired _help"_ ratifier than of their "hired _assistants. "_

####accompaniment 
**ACCOMPANIMENT, COMPANION, CONCOMITANT.**  
_Accompaniment_ is properly a collective term to express what goes in company, and is applied only to things; _companion_, which also signifies what is in the company, is applied either to persons or to things. _Concomitant_, from the intensive syllable _con_ and _comes_, a companion, implies what is attached to an object, or goes in its train, and is applied only to things.  
When said in relation to things, _accompaniment_ implies a necessary connection, _companion_ an incidental connection; the former is as a part to a whole, the latter is as one whole to another; the _accompaniment_ belongs to the thing accompanied, inasmuch as it serves to render it more or less complete; the _companion_ belongs to the thing accompanied, inasmuch as they correspond: in this manner singing is an _accompaniment_ to instrumental music; subordinate ceremonies are the _accompaniments_ in any solemn service: but a picture may be the _companion_ of another picture from their fitness to stand together. A _concomitant_ is as much of an appendage as the _accompaniment_, but it is applied only to moral objects; thus morality is a _concomitant_ to religion. 

####accompany 
**ACCOMPANY, ATTEND, ESCORT.**  
_Accompany_, Old French _companie_, Low Latin _companiem_, is compounded of _con_, with, and _punis_, bread, and signifies the breaking of bread together, hence friendly intercourse and society. _Accompany_ is compounded of _ad_, to, and _companiem_, and hence means to give one s society _to_ another. _Attend_, in French _attendre_, compounded of _ad_ and _tendere_, to tend or incline toward, signifies to direct one's notice or care toward any object. _Escort_, in French _escorter_, from the Latin _ex_ and _corrigo_ (set right or correct), meant to guide in the right direction, and referred especially to the band of armed attendants delegated to guide a traveler through a dangerous country.  
We _accompany_ those with whom we wish to go; we _attend_ those whom we wish to serve; we _escort_ those whom we are called upon to protect or guard. We _accompany_ our equals, we _attend_ our superiors, and _escort_ superiors or inferiors. The desire of pleasing or being pleased actuates in the first case; the desire of serving or being served, in the second cafe; the fear of danger or the desire of security, in the last place. One is said to have a numerous _company_, a crowd of _attendants_, and a strong _escort;_ but otherwise one person only may _accompany_ or _attend_, though several are wanting for an _escort._ Friends _accompany_ each other in their excursions; a servant _attends_ his master on a journey; a strong _escort_ is necessary in traveling through unfrequented and dangerous roads.  
_Accompany_ and _attend_ may likewise be said of things as well as persona. In this case the former is applied to what goes with an object so as to form a part of it; the latter to that which follows an object as a dependent upon it. Pride is often _accompanied_ by meanness, and _attended_ with much inconvenience to the possessor. 

####accomplice 
See [abettor](entry://abettor); [confederate](entry://confederate)

####accomplish 
**ACCOMPLISH, EFFECT, EXECUTE, ACHIEVE.**  
_Accomplish_, in French _accomplir_, is compounded of the intensive syllable _ac_ or _ad_, and _complir_, in Latin _compleo_, fill to the top, signifying to finish entirely. _Effect_, in Latin _effectue_, participle of _efficio_, compounded of _ex_, out of or up, and _facere_, to make, signifies to make until nothing remains to be done. (Compare the colloquial phrase "How did you _make out_ with it? ") _Execute_, in Latin _executus_, participle of _exsequor_, compounded of _ex_ and _sequor_, follow, signifies to carry through to the end. — (Compare the business slang _"follow-up_ methods, " etc.) _Achieve_, in French _achever_, from the phrase _venir à chef_, Latin _ad caput venire_, come to a head, expresses the same meaning by another and, to us also, a familiar metaphor.  
To _accomplish_, is properly a mode of effecting, namely, to effect completely, or to the utmost extent proposed; to _accomplish_ an object, therefore, signifies more than simply to _effect_ a purpose, both as to the thing aimed at and the means employed in bringing it about. Extraordinary means are requisite for _accomplishing_, and ordinary means for _effecting._ To _accomplish_ is properly said of that which a person sets before himself; but to _effect, execute_, and _achieve_ do not relate to the views of the person acting, but to the thing brought about. To _effect_ expresses less than _execute_ or _achieve;_ whatever is brought about or into effect is _effected;_ what is _executed_ is complicated in its nature, as to _execute_ a design or project; what is _achieved_ is grand, as to _achieve_ an enterprise. Practical abilities are requisite for _effecting_, skill for _executing_, spirit and talent for _achieving._ Some persons are always striving to attain an end without even _accomplishing_ what they propose. It is the part of wisdom to suit the means to the end when we have any scheme to _effect._ Those who are readiest in forming projects are not always the fittest for carrying them into _execution._ That ardor of character which impels to the _achievement_ of arduous undertakings belongs but to very few. We should never give up what we have the least chance of _accomplishing_, if it be worth the labor; nor pursue any plan which affords us no prospect of _effecting_ what we wish; nor undertake what we do not feel ourselves competent to _execute_, particularly when there is anything extraordinary to _achieve._ See also [fulfil](entry://fulfil)  
**ACCOMPLISHED, PERFECT, ACCOMPLISHMENT, PERFECTION.** — These epithets express an assemblage of all the qualities suitable to the subject; and mark the qualification in the highest degree. _Accomplished_ refers only to the artificial refinements of the mind; _perfect_ is said of things in general, — whether — natural — or — artificial, mental or corporeal.  
An acquaintance with modern languages and the ornamental branches of the arts and sciences constitutes a person _accomplished;_ the highest possible degree of skill in any art constitutes a man a _perfect_ artist.  
An _accomplishment_ is acquired; but a _perfection_ is either acquired or natural.

####accost 
**ACCOST, SALUTE, ADDRESS, GREET, HAIL, WELCOME.**  
_Accost_, in French _accoster_, is compounded of ad, and the Latin _costa_, a rib or side, signifying to come by the side of a person. _Salute_, in Latin _saluto_, from _salus_, health, signifies to bid good-speed. _Address_, in French _adresser_, compounded of _ad_ and _dresser_, from the Low Latin _drictus_, a contracted form of _directus_, straight, signifies to direct one's discourse to a person.  
See also under ABILITY.  
To _accost_ and _salute_ are said of persons on their first meeting; _address_ may be said of those who direct their discourse to others at any time. The leading idea of _accost_ is that of speaking to a person on corning up to him; _salute_ is to notice a person, which may be by words or otherwise: that of _address_ is I to direct one's words to the individual, which may either be personally or by writing. _Accosting_ is an act of familiarity not warranted by anything but an intimate acquaintance, or for purposes of business; _saluting_ is an act of courtesy between friends which cannot be dispensed with; _addressing_ is a matter of convenience or discretion.  
_Greet_, Anglo-Saxon _gretan_, to visit or address, implies a verbal and friendly salute between equals, conveying a good and kind wish. _Hail_, from _heal_ and _health_, denotes a wish for the health and long life of the person addressed, which was a customary form of address among the Eastern nations on approaching their sovereign; the word is now used to denote a similar expression on solemn occasions, particularly by the poets. _Welcome_ denotes an expression of good wishes and kind regards on a person's first arrival; it is therefore confined to strangers or those who have been absent for a time. See also under ACCEPTABLE. 

####account 
**ACCOUNT, RECKONING, BILL.**  
_Account_, compounded of _ad_ and _count_, signifies to count to a person; an account is the thing so counted. _Reckoning_, from the verb to _reckon_, signifies the thing reckoned up. _Bill_, Low Latin _billa_, is derived from Latin _bulla_, a sealed writing fastened with a _bulla_ or a round seal like a knob, knob being the original meaning of the word. (The same root appears in the words _bulletin_, Papal _bull, billet-doux._, etc.) These words, which are very similar in signification, may frequently be substituted for one another.  
_Account_ is the generic, the others the specific terms; a _reckoning_ and _bill_ is an _account_, though not always _vice versa; account_ expresses the details, with the sum of them counted up; _reckoning_ implies the register and notation of the things to be reckoned up; _bill_ denotes the details, with their particular charges. An _account_ should be correct, containing neither more nor less than is proper; a _reckoning_ should be explicit, leaving nothing unnoticed as to dates and names; a _bill_ should be fair. We speak of keeping an _account_, of coming to a _reckoning_, of sending in a _bill._ Customers have an _account_ with their tradespeople; masters have a _reckoning_ with their workpeople; tradesmen send in their _bills_ at stated periods.  
_Account_, from the extensive use of the term, is applicable to everything that is noted down, the particulars of which are considered worthy of notice, individually or collectively: merchants keep their _accounts;_ an _account_ is taken at the Custom-House of all that goes in and out of the kingdom; an _account_ is taken of all transactions, of the weather, of natural phenomena, and whatever is remarkable. _Reckoning_, as a particular term, is more partial in its use; it is mostly confined to the dealings of men with one another; in which sense it is superseded by the preceding term, and now serves to express only an explanatory enumeration, which may be either verbal or written. _Bill_, as implying something charged or engaged, is used not only in a mercantile but a legal sense; hence, we speak of a _bill_ of lading, a _bill_ of parcels, a _bill_ of exchange, a _bill_ of indictment, or a _bill_ in Parliament, Congress, or a Legislature.  
See also [reckon](entry://reckon); [sake](entry://sake)  
**ACCOUNT, NARRATIVE, DESCRIPTION.** — _Account_ is the most general of these terms; whatever is noted as worthy of remark is an _account. Narrative_, from _narrate_, in Latin _narratus_, from _narus_ or _gnarus_, knowing, signifies the thing made known. _Description_, from _describe_, in Latin _describo_, from de, down, and _scribere._ to write, signifies the thing written down.  
_Account_ has no reference to the person giving the account; a _narrative_ must have a narrator; a _description_ must have a describer. An _account_ may come from one or several quarters, or no specified quarter; but a _narrative_ and _description_ bespeak themselves as the production of some individual. _Accounts_ from the armies are anxiously looked for in time of war; he suddenly broke off his _narrative;_ his book is full of _descriptions._  
An _account_ may be given of political events, domestic occurrences, or natural phenomena, but more particularly of matters of temporary and immediate interest; it may be true or false; a _narrative_ is mostly personal, respecting the proceedings, accidents, or adventures of individuals; it may be real or fictitious; a _description_ does not so much embrace occurrences as local circumstances, properties, and characteristics; it is either correct or otherwise.

####accurate 
**ACCURATE, EXACT, PRECISE.**  
_Accurate_, in French _accurate_, Latin _accuratus_, participle of _accuro_, compounded of the intensive _ad_ and _curare_, to take care of signifies done with great care. _Exact_, in French _exacte_, Latin _exactus_, participle of _exigere_, to finish or complete, denotes the quality of completeness, the absence of defect. _Precise_, in French _précis_, Latin _prœcisus_, participle of _prœcidere_, to cut by rule after the manner of carpenters, signifies the quality of doing by rule.  
_Accurate_ refers to the care bestowed upon any matter to make it what it ought to be; _exact_ and _precise_ simply denote the quality of the thing, the former implying completeness, the latter nicety as to the manner of executing anything. From this difference in their meaning arises a difference in their application; a painting, on examination or on observation, is more properly said to be _accurate;_ a model, figure, or measure, to be _exact;_ a line, a rule, or a form, to be _precise._  
These epithets rise in sense upon each other, _exact_ signifying more than _accurate_, and _precise_ a greater degree of minuteness than either. With this distinction they may be applied to the same or similar objects: a description or view may be _accurate_ and _exact_, but in the former case it is only just as far as it goes, in the latter it is fuller of particulars and details.  
In denoting moral qualities or habits, _accuracy_ may be applied to whatever men attempt to do; _exactness_ to matters of economy, prudence, and duty; _precision_, in regard to manners, modes, and forms. _Accuracy_ is indispensable in either business or science, but particularly in commercial and legal transactions; _exactness_ is requisite in the payment of debts and the observance of all obligations. Some men may be very _accurate_ in their particular line who are not very _exact_ in fulfilling their engagements. In some cases, where great results may flow from trifling causes, the greatest _precision_ becomes requisite; we may, however, be too _precise_ when we dwell on unimportant particulars or adhere too tenaciously to forms and modes, but we never can be too _accurate_ or _exact;_ hence the epithet _precise_ is sometimes taken for affectedly _exact._ A man may be _precise_ in his dress who is not remarkable either for _accuracy_ or _exactness_ in his general conduct. A time or a period is said to be _exact_, an hour, a moment, or instant, _precise;_ an expression _accurate;_ the meaning of a word _precise._

####accusation 
See **complaint** under [complain](entry://complain)

####accuse 
**ACCUSE, CHARGE, IMPEACH, ARRAIGN.**  
_Accuse_, in Latin _accuse_, compounded of _ad_ and _causa_, a cause or trial, signifies to bring to trial. _Charge_, like _cargo_, is derived from Low Latin _carrico_, to load a car (Latin _carrus). Impeach_, in French _empêcher_, to hinder or disturb, compounded of _in_ and _pes_, the foot, signifies to entangle the feet in anything. _Arraign_, Old French _aranier, areisnier_, from Latin _ad_ and _ratio_, reason, meant to reason against, to bring a formal charge against another.  
The idea of asserting something to the prejudice of another is common to these terms; but _accuse_ is said of acts, _charge_ of moral qualities constituting the character: we _accuse_ a person of murder; we _charge_ him with dishonesty. _Accuse_ is properly a formal action; _charge_ is an informal action: criminals are _accused_, and their _accusation_ is proved in a court of judicature to be true or false; any person may be _charged_, and the _charge_ may be either substantiated or refuted in the judgment of a third person.  
_Impeach_ and _arraign_ are both species of _accusing;_ the former in application to statesmen and state concerns, the latter in regard to the general conduct or principles; with this difference, that he who _impeaches_ only asserts the guilt, but does not determine it; but those who _arraign_ also take upon themselves to decide: statesmen are _impeached_ for misdemeanors in the administration of government: kings _arraign_ governors of provinces and subordinate princes, and in this manner kings are sometimes _arraigned_ before mock tribunals: our Saviour was _arraigned_ before Pilate; _and_ creatures in the madness of presumption _arraign_ their Creator.  
**ACCUSE, CENSURE.** — _Accuse_, see above. _Censure_, in French _censure_, in Latin _censura_, is derived from _censor_, a Roman magistrate who took cognizance of the morals and manners of the citizens, as also of the domestic arrangements of the city. It signifies not only the office of censor, but, in an extended sense, the act of blaming or punishing offenders against morality, which formed a prominent feature in his office.  
To _accuse_ is only to assert that which is prejudicial to another; to _censure_ is to take the fault for granted. We _accuse_ only to make known the offence, to provoke inquiry; we _censure_ in order to inflict a punishment. An _accusation_ may be false or true; a _censure_ mild or severe. It is extremely wrong to _accuse_ another without sufficient grounds; but still worse to _censure_ him without the most substantial grounds. Every one is at liberty to _accuse_ another of offences which he knows him for a certainty to have committed; but none can _censure_ who are not authorized by their age or Station.

####achievement

####acknowledge 
**ACKNOWLEDGE, OWN, CONFESS, AVOW.**  
The first of these terms, compounded of α and _knowledge_, implies to bring to knowledge, to make known. _Own_ is a familiar figure, signifying to take to one's self, to make one's own; it is a common substitute for _confess. Confess_, in French _confesser_, Latin _confessus_, participle of _confiteor_, compounded of _con_, together, and _fateor_, I speak, signifies to impart to any one. _Avow_, in French _avouer_, Latin _advoveo_, signifies to vow or protest to any one.  
These words all denote the making known to others what relates to one's self, or that in which one has taken a part; _acknowledge_ is used in this general sense in a diversity of applications; the other terms are partially employed, and with various modifications in their meaning. _Acknowledge_ and _own_ are employed either in matters of indifference or those which are blameworthy; _confess_ mostly in such matters as are criminal or in a high degree culpable. A person _acknowledges_ that he was present, or owns that he assisted another, he _confesses_ a theft, or _confesses_ his guilt, or a sinner _confesses_ his sins. To _acknowledge_ and _own_, when applied to culpable matters, may either have respect to particular transactions or general characteristics, as to _acknowledge_ or _own_ the fact, to _acknowledge_ or _own_ one's weakness, fallibility, incapacity, etc.; to _confess_ is mostly said of particular transactions, as to _confess_ the crime laid to one's charge. To _acknowledge_, being a voluntary act, may be either by words or actions, or tacitly without any outward expression; _confessing_, on the other hand, being mostly called for in consequence of an interrogatory or the necessities of the party, must always be by express words.  
To _acknowledge_ and _own_ also signify to admit that a thing belongs to one, but the former denotes only a general relationship, the latter a special ownership; with this distinction we may speak of _acknowledging_ or _owning_ a son; but we may likewise _acknowledge_ many things which we cannot properly _own_, as to _acknowledge_ a woman as one's _wife_, or any particular person as a prince, or any particular state as independent.  
To _acknowledge, own_, and _confess_ are all used in the sense of expressing one's mind or what passes in one's mind, in which application they are comparable with _avow._ In this case to _acknowledge_ is most properly applied to matters of opinion, _own_ to matters of feeling, although they may in many such cases be indifferently employed.  
To _acknowledge_ is to declare in a general manner one's assent to anything; to _confess_ is to declare in a solemn manner one's assent to matters of faith; to _avow_ is to declare the motives or reasons of one's actions, particularly such as might with more propriety be concealed; as to _acknowledge_ the justness of a remark, to _confess_ the faith, to _avow_ one's motives, contempt, scorn, etc.

####acquaintance 
FAMILIARITY; _Intimacy. Acquaintance_, from _acquaint_, is derived from the Old French _acointer_ (Latin _ad_ and _cognitus_, from the verb _cognosco_ which is cognate with the English _know_ and has the same meaning); it signifies being known to another. _Familiarity_ comes from _familiar_, in Latin _familiaris_ and _familia_ (from _famulus_, a servant), signifying known as one of the household. _Intimacy_, from Latin _intimus_, innermost, signifies known to the innermost recesses of the heart. These terms mark different degrees of closeness in the social intercourse; _acquaintance_ expressing less than _familiarity_, and that less than _intimacy. Acquaintance_ springs from occasional intercourse; _familiarity_ is produced by a daily intercourse, which wears off all constraint and banishes all ceremony; _intimacy_ arises not merely from frequent intercourse, but unreserved communication. An _acquaintance_ will be occasionally a guest; but one that is on terms of _familiarity_ has easy access to our table; and an _intimate_ likewise lays claim to a share, at least, of our confidence. An _acquaintance_ with a person affords but little opportunity for knowing his character: _familiarity_ puts us in the way of _seeing_ his foibles, rather than his virtues; but _intimacy_ enables us to appreciate his worth.  
A simple _acquaintance_ is the most desirable footing on which to stand with all persons, however deserving. If it have not the pleasures of _familiarity_ or _intimacy_, it can claim the privilege of being exempted from their pains. "Too much _familiarity, "_ according to the old proverb, "breeds contempt. " The unlicensed freedom which commonly attends _familiarity_ affords but too ample scope for the indulgence of the selfish and unamiable passions. _Intimacies_ begun in love often end in hatred, as ill-chosen friends commonly become the bitterest enemies. A man may have a thousand acquaintances, and not one whom he should make his _intimate._  
These terms may be applied to things as well as persons, in which case they bear a similar analogy. An _acquaintance_ with a subject is opposed to entire ignorance upon it; _familiarity_ with it is the consequence of frequent repetition: and _intimacy_ of a steady and thorough research. In our intercourse with the world we become daily _acquainted_ with fresh subjects to engage our attention. Some men have by extraordinary diligence acquired a considerable _familiarity_ with more than one language and science; but few, if any, can boast of having possessed an _intimate acquaintance_ with all the particulars of even one language or science. When we can translate the authors of any foreign language, we may claim an _acquaintance_ with it; when we can speak or write it freely, we may be said to be _familiar_ with it; but an _intimate acquaintance_ comprehends a thorough critical _intimacy_ with all the niceties and subtleties of its structure. 

####acquiesce 
See [agree](entry://agree). 

####acquire 
**ACQUIRE, OBTAIN, GAIN, WIN, EARN.**  
_Acquire_, Old French _acquérir_, Latin _acquire_, is compounded of _ad_, to, and _quœrere_, to seek, signifying to seek or get for one's self. _Obtain_, in French _obtenir_, Latin _obtineo_, is compounded of _ob_, near, and _tenere_, to hold, signifying to lay hold or secure within one's reach. _Gain_ comes from French _gagne_, from a Teutonic root signifying a pasture, hence something to be desired among shepherd-people, hence success, profit. _Win_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _winnan_, to fight or struggle, hence to succeed in a struggle. _Earn_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _earnian_, allied to German _ernte_, a harvest.  
The idea of getting is common to these terms, but the circumstances of the action vary. We _acquire_ by our own efforts; we _obtain_ by the efforts of others as well as ourselves; we _gain_ or _win_ by striving; we _earn_ by labor. Talents and industry are requisite for _acquiring;_ what we _acquire_ comes gradually to us in consequence of the regular exercise of our abilities; in this manner, knowledge, honor, and reputation are _acquired._ Things are _obtained_ by all means, honest or dishonest; whatever comes into our possession agreeable to our wishes is _obtained;_ favors and requests are always _obtained._ Fortune assists in both _gaining_ and _winning;_ but particularly in the latter case; a subsistence, a superiority, a victory, or battle, is _gained;_ a game or a prize in the lottery is _won._ A good constitution and full employment are all that is necessary for _earning_ a livelihood. Fortunes are _acquired_ after a course of years; they are _obtained_ by inheritance, or _gained_ in trade.  
What is _acquired_ is solid, and produces lasting benefit; what is obtained may often be injurious to one's health, one's interest, or one's morals: what is _gained_ or _won_ is often only a partial advantage, and transitory in its nature; it is _gained_ or _won_ only to be lost; what is _earned_ serves sometimes only to supply the necessity of the moment; it is hardly got and quickly spent. Scholars _acquire_ learning, _obtain_ rewards, _gain_ applause, and _win_ prizes, which are often hardly earned by the loss of health.  
**ACQUIRE, ATTAIN.** — To _acquire_ is a progressive and permanent action. To _attain_, in Latin _attingo_, compounded of _ad_ and _tango_, touch, signifies to touch the goal, to reach the end, and represents a perfect and finished action. We always go on _acquiring;_ but we stop when we have _attained._ What is _acquired_ is something got into one's possession; what is _attained_ is the point arrived at. We _acquire_ a language; we _attain_ to a certain degree of perfection. By abilities and perseverance we may _acquire_ a considerable fluency in speaking several languages; but we can scarcely expect to _attain_ to the perfection of a native in any foreign language. Ordinary powers coupled with diligence will enable a person to _acquire_ whatever is useful; but we cannot _attain_ to superiority without extraordinary talents and determined perseverance. _Acquirements_ are always serviceable; _attainments_ always creditable.  
**ACQUIREMENT, ACQUISITION.** — Two abstract nouns, from the same verb, denoting the thing acquired. _Acquirement_ implies the thing acquired for and by ourselves; _acquisition_, that which is acquired for the benefit of one's self or another. People can expect to make but slender _acquirements_ without a considerable share of industry; and without them they will be no _acquisition_ to the community to which they have attached themselves. _Acquirement_ respects rather the exertions employed; _acquisition_ the benefit or gain accruing. To learn a language is an _acquirement;_ to gain a class or a degree, an _acquisition._ The _acquirements_ of literature far exceed in value the _acquisitions_ of fortune.

####acrimony 
**ACRIMONY, TARTNESS, ASPERITY, HARSHNESS.**  
These epithets are figuratively employed to denote sharpness of feeling corresponding to the quality in natural bodies. _Acrimony_, in Latin _acrimonia_, from _acer_, sharp, is the characteristic of garlic, mustard, and pepper, that is, a biting sharpness. _Tartness_, from _tart_, Anglo-Saxon _teart_, sharp, from _teran_, tear, is associated with the idea of _tearing_ as _bitter_ is associated with that of _biting. Asperity_ is derived from the Latin _asper_, a word of uncertain etymology signifying rough. _Harshness_ is the substantive corresponding to _harsh_, a Scandinavian word signifying rank, unpleasant to the taste, and denotes especially the sharp, rough taste of unripe fruit.  
A quick sense produces _acrimony;_ it is too frequent among disputants, who embitter each other's feelings. An acute sensibility, coupled with quickness of intellect, produces _tartness;_ it is too frequent among females. _Acrimony_ is a transient feeling that discovers itself by the words; _tartness_ is an habitual irritability that mingles itself with the tone and looks. An _acrimonious_ reply frequently gives rise to much ill-will; a _tart_ reply is often treated with indifference, as indicative of the natural temper, rather than of any unfriendly feeling.  
_Asperity_ and _harshness_ respect one's conduct to inferiors; the latter expresses a strong degree of the former. _Asperity_ is opposed to mildness and forbearance; _harshness_ to kindness. A reproof is conveyed with _asperity_, when the words and looks convey strong displeasure; a treatment is _harsh_ when it wounds the feelings and does violence to the affections. Mistresses sometimes chide their servants with _asperity;_ parents sometimes deal _harshly_ with their children. 

####act 
**ACT, DO, MAKE.**  
_Act_, in Latin _actus_, participle of _ago_, Greek _άγω_, drive or impel, signifies literally to move or put in motion. _Do_, in German _thun_, like the Greek _τίθημι_, signifies to put or put in order, to bring to pass. _Make_, Anglo-Saxon _macian_, corresponds to German _machen_, and is allied to _match._  
All these terms imply to exert a power in a given form and manner: _act_, which is the general term, conveys this general idea without any further qualification; the other terms convey this idea with modifications. We always _act_ when we _do_, but we do not always _do_ when we _act._ To _act_ is applied either to persons or things, as a spring or a lock _acts;_ to _do_ applies in this sense to persons only. To _act_ is also mostly intransitive or reflective, as to _act_ well or ill in this or that manner; to _do_ is always transitive, as to _do_ right or wrong, to _do_ one's duty.  
One may either _act_ a part or _do_ one's part, which are essentially different things; to _act_ a part is either really or fictitiously to _act_ in any part; but to _do_ our part is to _do_ that which is allotted to us as our part or duty.  
To _do_ and to _make_, in regard to persons, are both used in the sense of voluntarily exerting a power to bring a thing to pass; but _do_ applies to the ordinary business of life or what is _done_ by a given rule, as to _do_ a work, to _do_ justice; _make_ applies to that which is _done_ by a particular contrivance or for a particular purpose, as to _make_ a pen or a table, etc. What is _done_ once may have been _done_ before, and may be _done_ again; but what is _made_ is at once brought into existence, and, if it be _made_ again, it can only be by imitation.  
To _do_ and to _make_, as applied to things, signify to cause; but the former is used only in the expressions to _do_ good or harm, the latter is ordinarily used, to _make_ room, to _make_ a thing easy, etc.  
**ACT, WORK, OPERATE.** — To _act_ is to exert a simple power, or by simple means, as a wire _acts. Work_, Anglo-Saxon _wyrcan_, like the German _wirken_, etc., is to exert complex powers, or exert power by a gradual process. A machine _works_, but each of its parts is said to _act;_ so beer _works_, and bread _works; acting_ may be accompanied with no particular effect or change in the body that _acts_, but that which _works_ mostly undergoes a change and also produces changes, as medicine which _works_ in the system. Sometimes _act_ as well as _work_ is taken in the sense of exerting a power upon other bodies and producing changes, as the sun _acts_ on the plants.  
To _work_ and _operate_ both imply to _act_, or exert a power in order to bring about some end or purpose; but _operate_ is applied to matters of a general nature in science or morals, as a measure _operates_, or words may _operate_ on the mind, or reasons may _operate_ on the understanding. To _work_ is mostly applied to familiar matters and particular objects, as the hand _works_, the head _works_, the brain _works; operate_ is always intransitive.  
As nouns, _action_ implies either the act of acting or the thing done; _work_, the act or state of working, or what results from the _work_, as to go to _work_ or be at _work_, the _work_ of one's hands; _operation_, either to the act of operating, as the _operation_ of thought or the _operation_ of vegetation, or the mode of operating, as the _operations_ of time are various.  
See also [deal](entry://deal)  
**ACT, ACTION, DEED.** — The words _act, action_, and _deed_, though derived from the preceding verbs, have an obvious distinction in their meaning. _Act_, in French _acte_, Latin _actum_, denotes the tiling done. _Action_, in French _action_, Latin _actio_, signifies doing. _Act_ is a single exercise of power, as an _act of_ the will or an _act_ of the mind, the _act_ of walking, speaking, and the like; _action_, a continued exercise of power, or a state of exercising power, as to be in _action_, as opposed to rest; the _action_ of walking is agreeable in fine weather.  
When these words are taken in the sense of the thing done, they admit of a similar distinction. An _act_ is the single thing done, or what is done by a single effort, as that is your _act_ or his _act;_ an _action_ may consist of more _acts_ than one, or embrace the causes and consequences of the action, as a bold _action_, to judge of _actions_, etc.  
Hence it is that the term _act_ is more proper than _action_ where it is so defined as to imply what is single and simple, as an _act_ of authority, an _act_ of government, an _act_ of folly, and the like; but otherwise the word _action_ is to be preferred where the moral conduct or character is in question. We may enumerate particular _acts_ of a man's life, as illustrative of certain traits in his character, or certain circumstances in his life; but to speak at large of his _actions_ would be to describe has character.  
_Act_ and _deed_ are both employed for what is done; but _act_ refers to the power exerted, and _deed_ to the work performed; as a voluntary or involuntary _act_, a good or bad _deed. Act_ is mostly employed either in an abstract or familiar application; _deed_ is employed for whatever men do in the business of life, particularly in those things which are extraordinary.  
_Acts_ are either public or private, of individuals or of bodies, as _acts_ of government, _acts_ of Parliament; _deeds_ are always private, or what is done by men individually.  
_Acts_ are in their proper sense informal; but _deeds_ may sometimes be formal instruments: when you speak of a thing as a man's _act_ and _deed_, this is not tautology; it is his _act_ as far as he and no one else _acts_ in it, it is his _deed_ as far as it is that which is done completely or is accomplished.  
**ACTION, GESTURE, GESTICULATION, POSTURE, ATTITUDE.** — _Action_, see derivation in preceding group of words; also BATTLE. _Gesture_, Low Latin _gestura_, Latin _gestus_, participle of _gero_, carry, signifies the manner of carrying one's body. _Gesticulation_, in Latin _gesticulatio_, comes from _gesticuler_, to make many gestures. _Posture_, in French _posture_, Latin _positura_, a position, comes from _positus_, participle of _pono_, signifying the manner of placing one's self. _Attitude_, in French _attitude_, Italian _attitudine_, is a doublet of _aptitude_, signifying a propriety in the disposition of one's body.  
All these terms are applied to the state of the body; the three former indicating a state of motion, the two latter a state of rest. _Action_ respects the movements of the body in general; _gesture_ is an _action_ indicative of some particular state of mind; _gesticulation_ is a species of artificial _gesture._ Raising the arm is an _action;_ bowing is a _gesture. Actions_ may be ungraceful; _gestures_ indecent. A suitable _action_ sometimes gives great force to the words that are uttered; _gestures_ often supply the place of language between people of different nations. _Actions_ characterize a man as vulgar or well-bred; _gestures_ mark the temper of the mind. There are many _actions_ winch it is the object of education to prevent from growing into habits; savages express the vehement passions of the mind by vehement _gestures_ on every occasion, even in their amusements. An extravagant or unnatural _gesture_ is termed a _gesticulation;_ a sycophant, who wishes to cringe into favor with the great, deals largely in _gesticulation_ to mark his devotion; a buffoon who attempts to imitate the _gestures_ of another will use _gesticulation;_ and the monkey who apes the _actions_ of human beings does so by means of _gesticulations. Posture_ and _attitude_ both imply a mode of placing the body, but the _posture_ is either natural or assumed; the _attitude_ is always assumed or represented: natural _postures_ are those in which the body places itself for its own conveniences, as sitting, standing, or lying _postures._  
A _posture_, when assumed, may be distorted or ridiculous, to suit the humor of the party, as mountebanks put themselves into ridiculous _postures;_ or they may be artfully contrived to improve the carriage of the body, as the _postures_ of a dancing-master; and, in graver matters, a person may put himself in a _posture_ of defence.  
An _attitude_ is assumed in order to display some grace of the body, or some affection or purpose of the mind, as to stand in a graceful _altitude_, to represent any one in the _attitude_ of prayer.  
These terms may be applied to things personified, with precisely the same distinction. They may also be applied figuratively to other objects besides the body, as an army assumes a menacing _attitude_, a critical _posture_ of affairs.  
**ACTION, AGENCY.** — _Action_ is the effect; _agency_ the cause. _Action_ is inherent in the subject; _agency_ is something exterior; it is, in fact, putting a thing into _action:_ in this manner the whole world is in _action_ through the _agency_ of the Divine Being. 

####active 
**ACTIVE, DILIGENT, INDUSTRIOUS, ASSIDUOUS, LABORIOUS.**  
_Active_, from the verb to _act_, implies a propensity to act, to be doing something without regard to the nature of the object. _Diligent_, in French _diligent_, Latin _diligens_, participle of _diligo_, to choose or like, implies an attachment to an object, and consequent attention to it. _Industrious_, in French _industrieux_, Latin _industrius_, from _indu_, for _in_, and _struere_, to build, make, or do, signifies an inward or thorough inclination to be engaged in some serious work, _Assiduous_, in Latin _assiduus_, is compounded of _ad_ and _siduus_, from _sedere_, to sit, signifying to sit close to a thing. _Laborious_, in French _laborieux_, Latin _laboriosus_, from _labor_, signifies the inclination to labor.  
We are _active_ if we are only ready to exert our powers, whether to any end or not; we are _diligent_ when we are active for some specific end; we are _industrious_ when no time is left unemployed in some serious pursuit; we are _assiduous_ if we do not leave a thing until it is finished; we are _laborious_ when the bodily or mental powers are regularly employed in some hard labor. A man may be _active_ without being _diligent_, since he may employ himself in what is of no importance; but he can scarcely be _diligent_ without being _active_, since _diligence_ supposes some degree of activity in one's application to a useful object. A man may be _diligent_ without being _industrious_, for he may _diligently_ employ himself about a particular favorite object without employing himself constantly in the same way; and he may be _industrious_ without being _diligent_, since _diligence_ implies a free exercise of the mental as well as corporeal powers; but _industry_ applies principally to manual labor. _Activity_ and _diligence_ are, therefore, commonly the property of lively or strong minds, but _industry_ may be associated with moderate talents. A man may be _diligent_ without being _assiduous;_ but he cannot be _assiduous_ without being _diligent_, for _assiduity_ is a sort of persevering _diligence._ A man may be _industrious_ without being _laborious_, but not _vice versa;_ for _laboriousness_ is a severer kind of _industry._  
**ACTIVE, BRISK, AGILE, NIMBLE.** — _Active_, see preceding group. _Brisk_ is of obscure origin, possibly Celtic. _Agile_, in Latin _agilis_, comes from the same verb as active, signifying a fitness, a readiness to act or move. _Nimble_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _niman_ (German _nehmen)_, to take, implying a capacity "to take hold, " to "catch on, " as we say to-day. Compare the name _Nym_, in _Henry V_, signifying thief.  
_Activity_ respects one's transactions; _briskness_ one's sports: men are _active_ in carrying on business; children are _brisk_ in their play. _Agility_ refers to the fight and easy carriage of the body in springing; _nimbleness_ to its quick and gliding movements in running. A rope-dancer is _agile;_ a female moves _nimbly. Activity_ results from ardor of mind; _briskness_ from vivacity of feeling: _agility_ is produced by corporeal vigor and habitual strong exertion; _nimbleness_ results from an habitual effort to move lightly.  
See also [kinetic](entry://kinetic)  
**ACTIVE, BUSY, OFFICIOUS.** — _Active_, same as in the preceding groups. _Busy_, Anglo-Saxon _bysig_, signifies to be actively engaged in some work. _Officious_, in French _officieux_, Latin _officiosus_, from _officium_, duty or service, signifies a propensity to perform some service or office.  
_Active_ respects the habit or disposition of the mind; _busy_ and _officious_, either the disposition of the mind, or the employment of the moment: the former regards every species of employment; the latter only particular kinds of employment. An _active_ person is ever ready to be employed; a person is _busy_ when he is actually employed in any object; he is _officious_ when he is employed for others. _Active_ is always taken in a good, or at least an indifferent sense; it is opposed to lazy: _busy_, as it respects occupation, is mostly in a good sense; it is opposed to being at leisure; as it respects disposition, it is always in a bad sense; _officious_ is seldom taken in a good sense; it implies being _busy_ without discretion. To an _active_ disposition nothing is more irksome than inaction; but it is not concerned to inquire into the utility of the action. It is better for a person to be _busy_ than quite unemployed; but a _busy_ person will employ himself about the concerns of others when he has none of his own sufficiently important to engage his attention; an _officious_ person is as unfortunate as he is troublesome; when he strives to serve he has the misfortune to annoy. 

####actor 
**ACTOR, AGENT.**  
These terms vary according to the different senses of the verb from which they are drawn. _Actor_ is used for one who either acts a part, or who represents the actions and characters of others, whether real or feigned.  
_Agent_ is, in the general sense, an active or acting being, one possessing and exerting the faculty of action, as a free _agent_, a moral _agent._ The _agent_ is properly opposed to the patient in the physical world. _Agent_ is also taken generally for whatever puts in motion.  
_Actor, Player, Performer. -_ — The _actor_ and _player_ both perform on a stage; but the former is said in relation to the part that is acted, the latter to the profession that is followed. We may be _actors_ occasionally, without being players professionally, but we may be _players_ without deserving the name of _actors._ Those who personate characters for their amusement are _actors_, but not _players;_ those who do the same for a livelihood are _players_ as well as _actors;_ hence we speak of a company of _players_, not _actors._ So, likewise, in the figurative sense, whoever acts a part real or fictitious, that is, on the stage of life, or the stage of a theatre, is an _actor;_ but he only is a _player_ who performs the fictitious part; hence the former is taken in a bad or good sense, according to circumstances.  
The _player_ is always taken in a less favorable sense, from the artificiality which attaches to his profession.  
_Performer_ signifies, in its' most general sense, one that performs any act or part; but in a limited sense, one who performs a part in a public exhibition, whether as a singer, actor, dancer, or otherwise. 

####actual 
**ACTUAL, REAL, POSITIVE.**  
_Actual_, in French _actuel_, Latin _actualis_, from _actio_, a deed, signifies belonging to the thing done. _Real_, in French _réel_, Latin _realis_, from _res_, signifies belonging to the thing as it is. _Positive_, in French _positif_, Latin _positivus_, from _pono_, place or fix, signifies the state or quality of being fixed, established.  
What is _actual_ has proof of its existence within itself, and may be exposed to the eye; what is _real_ may be satisfactorily proved to exist; and what is _positive_ precludes the necessity of a proof. _Actual_ is opposed to the supposititious, conceived or reported; _real_ to the feigned, imaginary; _positive_ to the uncertain, doubtful. Whatever is the condition of a thing for the time being is the _actual_ condition; sorrows are _real_ which flow from a substantial cause; proofs are _positive_ which leave the mind in no uncertainty. The _actual_ state of a nation is not to be ascertained by individual instances of poverty, or the reverse; there are but few, if any, _real_ objects of compassion among common beggars; many _positive_ facts have been related of the deception which they have practised. By an _actual_ survey of human life, we are alone enabled to form just opinions of mankind; it is but too frequent for men to disguise their _real_ sentiments, although it is not always possible to obtain _positive_ evidence of their insincerity.

####actuate 
**ACTUATE, IMPEL, INDUCE.**  
_Actuate_, from the Latin _actum_, an action, implies to call into action. _Impel_, in Latin _impello_, is compounded of _in_, toward, and _pellere_, to drive, signifying to drive toward an object. _Induce_, in Latin _induce_, is compounded of _in_, in, and _ducere_, to lead, signifying to lead into an object.  
One is _actuated_ by motives, _impelled_ by passions, and _induced_ by reason or inclination. Whatever _actuates_ is the result of reflection; it is a steady and fixed principle: whatever _impels_ is momentary and vehement, and often precludes reflection: whatever _induces_ is not vehement, though often momentary. One seldom repents of the thing to which one is _actuated;_ as the principle, whether good or bad, is not liable to change: but we may frequently be _impelled_ to measures which cause serious repentance: the thing to which we are _induced_ is seldom of sufficient importance to call for repentance. 

####acute 
**ACUTE, KEEN, SHREWD, SHARP.**  
_Acute_, in French _aigu_, Latin _acutus_, associated with _acus_,__ a needle, signifies the quality of sharpness and pointedness peculiar to a needle. _Keen_ in Anglo-Saxon _cene_, is related to the German _kühn_, bold, and signified originally energy and activity of spirit, hence quickness of mind. _Shrewd_, from the verb _shrewen_, to curse, beshrew, is from Anglo-Saxon _screawa_, a shrew-mouse, whose bite was venomous, and is allied to the word _shrew_, a scolding woman. It meant malicious, cunning, sharp, in the double sense — sharp of temper, and sharp of mind and tongue — hence the modern significance.  
In the natural sense, a fitness to pierce is predominant in the word _acute;_ and that of cutting, or a fitness for cutting, in the word _keen._ The same difference is observable in their figurative acceptation. An _acute_ understanding is quick at discovering truth in the midst of falsehood; it fixes itself on a single point with wonderful celerity: a keen understanding cuts or removes away the artificial veil under which the truth lies hidden from the view: a _shrewd_ understanding is rather quicker at discovering new truths than at distinguishing truth from falsehood. _Acuteness_ is requisite in speculative and abstruse discussions; _keenness_ in penetrating characters and springs of action; _shrewdness_ in eliciting remarks and new ideas. The _acute_ man detects errors, and the _keen_ man falsehoods; the _shrewd_ man exposes follies. Arguments may be _acute_, reproaches _keen_, and replies or retorts _shrewd._ A polemic, or a lawyer, must be _acute_, a satirist _keen_, and a wit _shrewd. Sharp_ primarily signifies a thin edge or fine point; also artful, crafty, subtle. A pain, ache, or retort in conversation may be distressingly _sharp._ An unscrupulous person is often guilty of _sharp practice_ in dealing with others.

####add 
**ADD, JOIN, UNITE, COALESCE.**  
_Add_, in Latin _addo_, compounded of _ad_ and _do_, to give or put, signifies to put one thing to another. _Join_, in French _joindre_, and Latin _jungo_, is in all probability connected with, if not derived from, the Greek, _ξεϋγω_, to yoke, that is, to set one thing in juxtaposition with another. _Unite_, from the Latin _unus_, one, signifies to make into one. _Coalesce_, in Latin _coalesco_, from _con_, together, and _alescere_, to grow, signifies to grow together.  
We _add_ by putting a part to any body so as to form a whole; _we join_ by attaching two whole bodies to each other; we _unite_ by putting two bodies to or into one another, so that they may become one body; things _coalesce_ when their parts mingle together so as to form one substance. _Additions_ may be made to whatever admits of becoming greater in size or quantity; a wing may be _added_ to a building, or a house may be _added_ to a row of houses; _junctions_ may be made of any two bodies which can touch each other in any part; thus two houses may be _joined_, or two countries, lands, kingdoms, etc., may _be joined; unions_ may be formed of any things which admit of being made into one so as to lose their individuality; as, if two houses be made into one, they may be said to be _united;_ things may be said to _coalesce_, the minutest parts of which will readily fall into one another; a _coalition_ is properly a complete _union_, and is applied to the natural process of bodies. _Adding_ is opposed to subtracting or diminishing, _joining_ to separating, _uniting_ to dividing, and _coalescing_ to falling asunder.  
They preserve this distinction in their moral application. One virtue or perfection may be _added_ to another; persons _join_ in matrimony, trade, or other particular act; they _unite_ in families, in mind, or modes of living; qualities may be _joined_ with others in the same substance, without any necessary connection between them; they are _united_ when they belong to or are intimately connected with each other; nations _coalesce_ when they adopt the same language, laws, and manners; parties _coalesce_ when they lay aside their differences and _unite._

####addict 
**ADDICT, DEVOTE, APPLY.**  
_Addict_, from _addico_, or _ad_ and _dico_, to speak or declare in favor of a thing, signifies generally to apply one's self to it. _Devote_, from the Latin _devoveo_, or _de_, on account or behalf of, and _voveo_, to vow, signifies to make a solemn vow or resolution for a thing. _Apply_, in French _appliquer_, and Latin _applico_, from _ap_ or _ad_ and _plico_, signifies to knit or join one's self to a thing.  
To _addict_ is to indulge one's self in any particular practice; to _devote_ is to direct one's powers and means to any particular pursuit; to _apply_ is to employ one's time or attention about any object. Men are _addicted_ to learning; they _devote_ their talents to the acquirement of any art or science; they _apply_ their minds to the investigation of a subject.  
_Addict_ is seldomer used in a good than in a bad sense; _devote_ is mostly employed in a good sense; _apply_ in an indifferent sense. We are _addicted_ to a thing from an irresistible passion or propensity; we are _devoted_ to a thing from a strong, but settled, attachment to it; we _apply_ to a thing from a sense of its utility. We _addict_ ourselves to study by yielding to our passion for it; we _devote_ ourselves to the service of our king and country by employing all our powers to their benefit; we _apply_ to business by giving it all the time and attention that it requires. 

####addition 
See [increase](entry://increase)

####address 
**ADDRESS, APPLY.**  
For the derivation of these words see [accost ](entry://accost )and ADDICT.  
An _address_ is immediately directed from one party to the other, either personally or by writing; an _application_ may be made through the medium of a third person. An _address_ may be made for an indifferent purpose or without any express object; but an _application_ is always occasioned by some serious circumstance. We _address_ those to whom we speak or write; but we _apply_ to those to whom we wish to communicate some object of personal interest. An _address_, therefore, may be made without an _application;_ and an _application_ may be made by means of an _address._ An _address_ may be rude or civil; an _application_ may be frequent or urgent. It is impertinent to _address_ any one with whom we are not acquainted, unless we have any reason for making an _application_ to him. It is a privilege of the British Constitution that the subject may _address_ the monarch, and _apply_ for a redress of grievances. A court is _addressed_ by a suitor or counsel on his behalf; it is _applied_ to by means of legal forms for the redress of grievances. We cannot pass through the streets of the metropolis without being continually _addressed_ by beggars, who _apply_ for the relief of artificial more than of real wants. Men in power are always exposed to be publicly _addressed_ by persons who wish to obtrude their opinions upon them, and to have perpetual _applications_ from those who solicit favors.

**ADDRESS, SPEECH, HARANGUE, ORATION.** — _Address_, see preceding terms for derivation. _Speech_, from Anglo-Saxon _spœc_, the substantive corresponding to _speak_, signifies the thing spoken. _Harangue_, Old French _harangue_, comes from Old High German _hrinc_, whence _ring, rank_, etc., are derived, and signified an address to a circle or _ring_ of listeners. _Oration_, from the Latin _oro_, to beg or entreat, signifies that which is said by way of entreaty.  
All these terms denote a set form of words directed or supposed to be directed to some person: an _address_ in this sense is always written, but the rest are really spoken, or supposed to be so; a _speech_ is in general that which is addressed in a formal manner to one person or more; a _harangue_ is a noisy, tumultuous _speech_ addressed to many; an _oration_ is a solemn _speech_ for any purpose. _Addresses_ are frequently sent up to the throne by public bodies. _Speeches_ in Parliament, like _harangues_ at elections, are often little better than the crude effusions of party spirit. The _orations_ of Demosthenes and Cicero, which have been so justly admired, received a polish from the correcting hand of their authors before they were communicated to the public. 

####adduce 
**ADDUCE, ALLEGE, ASSIGN, ADVANCE.**  
_Adduce_, in Latin _adducere_, compounded of _ad_ and _ducere_, to lead, signifies to bring forward proofs or evidence in support of some statement or proposition already made. _Allege_, in French _alléguer_, in Latin _allegare_, compounded of _ad_ and _legare_, from the stem _lex, legis_, law, signified to send with legal dispatches, hence to affirm authoritatively. _Assign_, in French _assigner_, Latin _assigno_, compounded of _as_ or _ad_ and _signo_, to sign or mark out, signifies to set apart for a purpose. _Advance_, Middle English _avancen_, from French _avant_, Low Latin _ab_ (from) and _ante_ (before), written _abante_, signified to come from the front ranks, to proceed from the front ranks forward.  
An argument is _adduced;_ a fact or a charge is _alleged;_ a reason is _assigned;_ a position or an opinion is _advanced._ What is _adduced_ tends to corroborate or invalidate; what is _alleged_ tends to criminate or exculpate; what is _assigned_ tends to justify or support; what is _advanced_ tends to explain and illustrate. Whoever discusses disputed points must have arguments to _adduce_ in favor of his principles; censures should not be passed where nothing improper can be _alleged;_ a conduct is absurd for which no reason can be _assigned;_ those who _advance_, what they cannot maintain expose their ignorance as much as their folly. We may controvert what is _adduced_ or _advanced;_ we may deny what is _alleged_, and question what is _assigned._ The reasoner _adduces_ facts in proof of what he has _advanced;_ the accuser _alleges_ circumstances in support of his charge; the philosophical investigator _assigns_ causes for particular phenomena.

####adhere 
**ADHERE, ATTACH, ADHESION, ADHERENCE.**  
_Adhere_, from the French _adhérer_, Latin _adhœro_, is compound of _ad_ and _hœro_, to stick close to. _Attach_, in French _attacher_, is compounded of _ad_ and a root which is found in the English word _tack_, meaning peg or small nail, so that to _attach_ was to fasten with a _tack._  
A thing is _adherent_ by the union which nature produces; it is _attached_ by arbitrary ties which keep it close to another thing. Glutinous bodies are apt to _adhere_ to everything they touch; a smaller building is sometimes _attached_ to a larger by a passage, or some other mode of communication. What _adheres_ to a thing is closely joined to its outward surface; but what is _attached_ may be fastened to it by the intervention of a third body. There is a universal _adhesion_ in all the particles of matter one to another; the sails of a vessel are _attached_ to a mast by means of ropes; or bodies are _attached_ by bare locality, or being in the same enclosure.  
In the improper and figurative application, _things_ adhere from a fitness of their natures. Things are _attached_ to each other by political ties.  
_Adherence_ and _attachment_ are both applied to persons in a moral sense; the former as it respects matters of principle, the latter as it respects matters of inclination or interest. _Adherence_ is always marked by a particular fine of conduct; but _attachment_ may exist without any particular expression. A person _adheres_ to a prince or a community so long as he follows the one or co-operates with the other; he is _attached_ to a person whenever the feeling or relation is created.  
In the same manner, a person _adheres_ to matters of opinion, by professing his belief; he is _attached_ to objects from habit or private motives.  
_Adhesion_ and _adherence_ are both derived from the verb _adhere_, one expressing the proper or figurative sense, and the other the moral sense or acceptation. There is a power of _adhesion_ in all glutinous bodies, a disposition for _adherence_ in steady minds.

####adjacent 
**ADJACENT, ADJOINING, CONTIGUOUS.**  
_Adjacent_, in Latin _adjiciens_, participle of _adjicio_, is compounded of _ad_ and _jacio_, to lie near. _Adjoining_, as the word implies,, signifies being joined together. _Contiguous_, Latin _contiguus_, comes from _contingo_, or _con_ and _tango_, signifying to touch close.  
What is _adjacent_ may be separated altogether by the intervention of some third object; what is _adjoining_ must touch in some part; and what is _contiguous_ must be fitted to touch entirely on one side. Lands are _adjacent_ to a house or a town; fields are _adjoining_ to each other; and houses _contiguous_ to each other.

####admit 
**ADMIT, RECEIVE.**  
_Admit_, in French _admettre_, Latin _admitto_, compounded of _ad_ and _mitto_, signifies to send or suffer to pass to. _Receive_, in French _recevoir_, Latin _recipio_, compounded of _re_ and _capio_, signifies to take back or to one's self.  
To _admit is_ a general term, the sense of which depends upon what follows; to _receive_ has a complete sense in itself: we. cannot speak of _admitting_ without associating with it an idea of the object to which one is _admitted;_ but _receive_ includes no relative idea of the _receiver_ or the received. _Admitting_ is an act of relative import; _receiving_ is always a positive measure: a person may be _admitted_ into a house, who is not prevented from entering; he is _received_ only by the actual consent of some individual We may be _admitted_ in various capacities; we are _received_ only as guests, friends, or inmates. Persons are _admitted_ to the tables, and into the familiarity or confidence of others; they are hospitably _received_ by those who wish to be their entertainers.  
When applied to unconscious agents, the distinction is similar: rays of light are _admitted_ into a room, or ideas into the mind, when they are suffered to enter at pleasure; but things _receive_ each other for specific purposes, according to the laws of nature.  
We _admit_ willingly or reluctantly; we _receive_ politely or rudely. Foreign ambassadors are _admitted_ to an audience, and _received_ at court. It is necessary to be cautious not to _admit_ any one into our society who may not be an agreeable and suitable companion; but still more necessary not to _receive_ any one into our houses whose character may reflect disgrace on ourselves. Whoever is _admitted_ as a member of any community should consider himself as bound to conform to its regulations; whoever is _received_ into the service of another should study to make himself valued and esteemed. A winning address and agreeable manners gain a person _admittance_ into the most refined circles; the talent for affording amusement procures a person a good _reception_ among the mass of mankind.  
**ADMIT, ALLOW, PERMIT, SUFFER, TOLERATE.** — _Admit_, see key word preceding. _Allow_, in French _allouer_, from Latin _allaudare_, from _laus, laudis_, praise, signified to give approving consent. Compare _laudatory, laudable_, etc. _Permit_, in French _permettre_, Latin _permitto_, is compounded of _per_, through or away, and _mitto_, to send or let go, signifying to let go its way. _Suffer_, in French _souffrir_, Latin _suffero_, is compounded of _sub_ and _fero_ (cognate with English _bear)_, signifying to bear with. _Tolerate_, in Latin _toleratus_, participle of _tolero_, sustain, signifies to bear or bear with.  
To _admit_ is an involuntary or negative act; to _allow_ is voluntary and positive: we _admit_ by simply not refusing or preventing; we _allow_ by positively granting or complying with; we _admit_ that which concerns ourselves or is dune toward ourselves; we _allow_ that which is for the convenience of others, or what they wish to do: one _admits_ the freedoms or familiarities of those who choose to offer them; one _allows_ an indulgence to a child. To _permit_ is very nearly allied to _allow_, both in sense and application, with this difference, that _permit_ is more formal and positive, being employed in respect to more important matters; as a father _permits_ his son to travel; one man _permits_ another to use his name. To _suffer_ and _tolerate_ are nearly allied to _admit_, but both are mere passive acts, and relate to matters which are more objectionable and serious: what is _admitted_ may be at most but inconvenient; what is _suffered_ may be burdensome to the sufferer, if not morally wrong; what is _tolerated_ is bad in itself, and _suffered_ only because it cannot be prevented: a parent frequently _suffers_ in his children what he condemns in others; there are some evils in society which the magistrate finds it needful to _tolerate._  
A well-regulated society will be careful not to _admit_ of any deviation from good order, which may afterward become injurious as a practice: it frequently happens that what has been _allowed_ from indiscretion is afterward claimed as a right: no earthly power can _permit_ that which is prohibited by the divine law: when abuses are _suffered_ to creep in and to take deep root in any established institution, it is difficult to bring about a reform without endangering the existence of the whole; when abuses, therefore, are not very grievous, it is wiser to _tolerate_ them than run the risk of producing a greater evil.  
**ADMIT, ALLOW, GRANT.** — These terms are here compared only in regard to matters of speculation; and in this case they rise in sense, _allow_ being more voluntary and positive than _admit_, and _grant_ more so than _allow._ What is _admitted_ is that which it is either not easy or possible for a person to deny; certain facts are _admitted_ winch are too clearly proved to be disputed; what is _allowed_ is that which is agreed to from the conviction or feelings of the party _allowing;_ it is said mostly of that in which the interests as well as the opinions of men are concerned; he _allows_ that it would be good, but thinks that it is not practicable; what is _granted_ is agreed upon as true, and is said most properly of abstract or self-evident truths, as to _grant_ that two and two make four, or to take that for _granted_ which is the point in dispute.  
**ADMITTANCE, ADMISSION.** — These words differ according to the different acceptations of the primitive from which they are both derived; the former being taken in the proper sense or familiar style, and the latter in the figurative sense or in the grave style. The _admittance_ to public places of entertainment is, on particular occasions, difficult. The _admission_ of irregularities, however trifling in the commencement, is mostly attended with serious consequences.  
_Admittance_ is properly confined to the receiving a person or a thing into a given place; _admission_ includes in itself the idea not only of receiving, but also the purpose of receiving. Whoever is _admitted_, or has the liberty of entering any place, whether with or without an object, has _admittance;_ but a person has _admission_ to places of trust, or into offices and the like.

####admonish 
**ADMONISH, ADVISE.**  
_Admonish_, in Latin _admoneo_, is compounded of the intensive _ad_ and _monere_, to advise, signifying to put seriously in mind. _Advise_ is compounded of the Latin _ad_ and _visus_, participle of _videre_, to see, signifying to make to see or to show.  
_Admonish_ mostly regards the past; _advise_ respects the future. We _admonish_ a person on the errors he has committed, by representing to him the extent and consequences of his offence; we _advise_ a person as to his future conduct, by giving him rules and instructions. Those who are most liable to transgress require to be _admonished;_ those who are most inexperienced require to be _advised. Admonition_ serves to put people on their guard against evil; _advise_ to direct them in the choice of good.  
**ADMONITION, WARNING, CAUTION.** — _Admonition_ (see [admonish](entry://admonish)). _Warning_, from Anglo-Saxon _warnian_, is allied with the words _wary, ward, guard_, etc., and hence it meant to tell another to _beware_, to be on his _guard. Caution_, from _caveo_, beware, signifies the making beware. A guarding against evil is common to these terms; but _admonition_ expressed more than _warning_, and that more than _caution._  
An _admonition_ respects the moral conduct; it comprehends reasoning and remonstrance: _warning_ and _caution_ respect the personal interest or safety; the former comprehends a strong, forcible representation of the evil to be dreaded; the latter a simple apprisal of a future contingency. _Admonition_ may therefore frequently comprehend _warning;_ and _warning_ may comprehend _caution_, though not _vice versa._ We _admonish_ a person against the commission of any offence; we _warn_ him against danger; we _caution_ him against any misfortune. _Admonitions_ and _warnings_ are given by those who are superior in age and station; _cautions_ by any who are previously in possession of information. Parents give _admonitions;_ ministers of the gospel give _warnings;_ indifferent persons give _cautions._ It is necessary to _admonish_ those who have once offended to abstain from a similar offence; it is necessary to _warn_ those of the consequences of sin who seem determined to persevere in a wicked course; it is necessary to _caution_ those against any false step who are going in a strange path. _Admonitions_ should be given with mildness and gravity; _warnings_ with impressive force and warmth; _cautions_ with clearness and precision. The young require frequent _admonitions;_ the ignorant and self-deluded solemn _warnings;_ the inexperienced timely _cautions. Admonitions_ ought to be listened to with sorrowful attention; _warnings_ should make a deep and lasting impression; _cautions_ should be borne in mind; but _admonitions_ are too often rejected, _warnings_ despised, and _cautions_ slighted.  
_Admonitions_ are given by persons only; _warnings_ and _cautions_ are given by things as well as persons. The young are _admonished_ by the old; the death of friends serves as a _warning_ to the survivors; the unfortunate accidents of the careless serve as a _caution_ to others to avoid the like error.

####adore 
**ADORE, WORSHIP.**  
_Adore_, in French _adorer_, Latin _adoro_ — that is, _ad_ and _or are_, to pray to. _Worship_, in Anglo-Saxon _weorthscype_, is contracted from _worthship_, implying either the object that is worth, or the worth itself: whence it has been employed to designate the action of doing suitable homage to the object which has worth, and, by a just distinction, of paying homage to our Maker by religious rites.  
_Adoration_ is the service of the heart toward a Superior Being, in which we acknowledge our dependence and obedience by petition and thanksgiving; _worship_ consists in the outward form of showing reverence to some supposed superior being. _Adoration_ can with propriety be paid only to the one true God; but _worship_ is offered by heathen to stocks and stones. We may _adore_ our Maker at all times and in all places, whenever the heart is lifted up toward Him; but we _worship_ Him only at stated times and according to certain rules. Outward signs are but secondary in the act of _adoration;_ and in divine _worship_ there is often nothing existing but the outward form. We may _adore_ without _worshipping;_ but we ought not to _worship_ without _adoring._  
**ADORE, REVERENCE, VENERATE, REVERE.** — _Adore_, see key word preceding. _Reverence_, in Latin _reverentia_, reverence or awe, implies to show reverence, from _revereor_, to stand in awe of; from _vereor_, I__ fear, allied with English _wary. Venerate_, in Latin _veneratus_, participle of _veneror_, is allied to _venus_, love, from a root _wan_ signifying to love or win. _Revere_ has the same etymology as _reverence. Adoration_ has been before considered only in relation to our Maker; it may, however, be employed in an improper and extended application to express in the strongest possible manner the devotion of the mind toward sensible objects. Good princes are frequently said to be _adored_ by their subjects.  
_Reverence_ is equally engendered by the contemplation of superiority, whether of the Supreme Being as our Creator, or of any earthly being as our parent: it differs, however, from _adoration_, inasmuch as it has a mixture of fear, arising from the consciousness of weakness and dependence, or of obligations for favors received. _Adoration_ in this case, as in the former, requires no external form; it is properly the homage of the mind: _reverencing_ our Maker is also an inward sentiment; but _reverencing_ our parents, who are invested with a sacred character, includes in it an outward expression of our sentiments by our deportment toward them.  
As sentiments of the mind, there is this distinction between _reverence_ and _veneration_, that the latter has none of the feeling of fear which forms a part of the former. The contemplation of a sacred edifice which combines grandeur with solemnity will awaken _reverence;_ the contemplation of any place rendered sacred by its antiquity awakens _veneration._  
Between the verbs to _revere_ and to _reverence_ there is but a small shade of difference in the sense: the former denotes a sentiment of the mind only; the latter the expression of that sentiment, as well as the sentiment itself. Hence we say with more propriety, to _revere_, not to _reverence_, a name or memory of any one, etc. 

####adorn 
**ADORN, DECORATE, EMBELLISH.**  
_Adorn_, in Latin, _adorno_, is compounded of the intensive syllable ad and _orno_, in Greek _ωραΐος_ beautiful, signifying to dispose for the purpose of ornament. _Decorate_, in Latin _decoratus_, participle of _decora_, from _decus_, an ornament, signifies to make beautiful by the addition of something extraneous. _Embellish_, in French _embellir_, is compounded of the intensive syllable _em or in_ and _bellir_ or _bel_, in Latin _belius_, handsome, signifying to make handsome.  
We _adorn_ by giving the best external appearance to a thing; we _decorate_ by annexing something to improve its appearance; we _embellish_ by giving a finishing stroke to a thing that is well executed, or adding to the beauty of a thing. Females _adorn_ their persons by the choice and disposal of their dress; or gentlemen _adorn_ their estates by giving them the appearance of tasteful cultivation: a head-dress is _decorated_ with flowers, or a room with paintings: fine writing is _embellished_ by suitable flourishes.  
_Adorn_ and _embellish_ are figuratively employed; _decorate_ only in the proper sense. Inanimate objects may be _adorned_, or the mind is _adorned_ by particular virtues which are implanted in it; a narrative is _embellished_ by the introduction of some striking incidents.

####adulate 
**ADULATE, FLATTER, COMPLIMENT.**  
_Adulate_, in Latin _adulatus_, participle of _adulor_, signified to wag the tail as a dog does, to fawn like a dog. _Flatter_, Old French _flater_, to stroke, to soothe, signified to calm with caressing words. _Compliment_, like _comply_, is derived through the Italian _complimento_, civility, from the Latin _compleo_, fill entirely, hence to fulfil expectations, to please.  
We _adulate_ by discovering in our actions as well as words an entire subserviency: we _flatter_ directly by words expressive of admiration; indirectly by actions which convey the same sentiments: we _compliment_ by fair language or respectful civilities. An _adulatory_ address is couched in terms of feigned devotion to the object; a _flattering_ address is filled with the fictitious perfections of the object; a _complimentary_ address is suited to the station of the individual and the occasion which gives rise to it. Courtiers are guilty of _adulation;_ lovers are addicted to _flattery;_ people of fashion indulge themselves in a profusion of _compliments. Adulation_ can never be practised without falsehood; its means are hypocrisy and lying, its motive servile fear, its end private interest: _flattery_ always exceeds the truth; it is extravagant praise dictated by an overweening partiality, or, what is more frequent, by a disingenuous temper: _compliments_ are not incompatible with sincerity, unless they are dictated from a mere compliance with the prescribed rules of politeness or the momentary desire of pleasing. _Adulation_ may be fulsome, _flattery_ gross, _compliments_ unmeaning. _Adulation_ inspires a person with an immoderate conceit of his own importance; _flattery_ makes him in love with himself; _compliments_ make him in good-humor with himself. 

####advance 
**ADVANCE, PROCEED.**  
_Advance_ (see [adduce](entry://adduce)). _Proceed_, in Latin _procedo_, signifies to go forward.  
To _advance_ is to go toward some point; to _proceed_ is to go onward in a certain course. The same distinction is preserved between them in their figurative acceptation. A person _advances_ in the world who succeeds in his transactions and raises himself in society; he _proceeds_ in his business when he carries it on as he has done before. We _advance_ by _proceeding_, and we _proceed_ in order to _advance._ Some people pass their lives in the same situation without _advancing;_ some are always doing without _proceeding._ Those who make considerable progress in learning stand the fairest chance of _advancing_ to dignity and honor.

####advantage 
**ADVANTAGE, BENEFIT, UTILITY.**  
_Advantage_, French _avantage_, for the derivation of which see _advance_ under ADDUCE, signifies that which _advances_ one's interests, improves one's condition. _Benefit_, in French _bienfait_, Latin _benefactum_, compounded of _bene_, well, and _factum_, done, signifies done or made to one's wishes. _Utility_, in French _utilité_, Latin _utilitas_, and _utilis_, useful, from _utor_, to use, signifies the quality of being able to be used.  
_Advantage_ respects external or extrinsic circumstances of profit, honor, and convenience; _benefit_ respects the consequences of actions and events; _utility_ respects the good which can be drawn from the use of any object large house or a particular situation may have its _advantages;_ suitable exercise is attended with _benefit;_ sun-dials have their _utility_ in ascertaining the hour precisely by the sun. Things are sold to _advantage;_ persons ride or walk for the _benefit_ of then health; they purchase articles for their _utility._ good education has always its _advantages_, although every one cannot derive the same _benefit_ from the cultivation of his talents, as all have not the happy art of employing their acquirements to the right objects; riches are of no _utility_ unless rightly employed. It is of great _advantage_ to young people to form good connections on their entrance into fife; it is no less _beneficial_ to their morals to be under the guidance of the aged and experienced, from whom they may draw many _useful_ directions for their future conduct. See also [good](entry://good)  
**ADVANTAGE, PROFIT.** — _Advantage_, see above. _Profit_, in French _profit_, Latin _profectus_, participle of _proficio_, compounded of _pro_ and _facio_, signifies to make an advance.  
The idea common to these terms is of some good received by a person. _Advantage_ is general; it respects everything which can contribute to the wishes, wants, and comforts of life; _profit_ in its proper sense is applied to pecuniary _advantage._ Situations have their _advantages;_ trade has its _profits. Advantage_ may be applied either to the good derived from a thing, as the _advantage_ of dress — that is, the _advantage_ derived from dress — or to the thing from which the good is derived, as, dress is an _advantage_ to the person.  
_Profit_ is always taken for that good which is derived from a thing.  
_Advantage_ implies something annexed to or coming to a thing accidentally; or it may be what a man esteems to be an _advantage; profit_ is that which is real, substantial, and permanent.

####adverse 
**ADVERSE, CONTRARY, OPPOSITE.**  
_Adverse_, in French _adverse_, Latin _adversus_, participle of _adverto_, compounded of _ad_ and _verto_, signifies turning toward or against. _Contrary_, in French _contraire_, Latin _contrarius_, comes from _contra_, against. _Opposite_, in Latin _oppositus_, participle of _oppono_, is compounded of _ob_ and _pono_, signifying placed in the way.  
_Adverse_ respects the feelings and interests of persons; _contrary_ regards their plans and purposes; _opposite_ respects the situation and relative nature of things. Fortune is _adverse;_ an event turns out _contrary_ to what was expected; sentiments are _opposite_ to each other. Circumstances are sometimes so _adverse_ as to baffle the best concerted plans; facts often prove directly _contrary_ to the representations given of them; people with _opposite_ characters cannot be expected to act together with pleasure to either party.  
**ADVERSE, INIMICAL, HOSTILE, REPUGNANT.** — _Adverse_, see above. _Inimical, f_rom the Latin _in amicus_, not friendly, and _hostile_ from Latin _hostis_, an enemy (allied to English _guest_, a stranger), signify belonging to an enemy. _Repugnant_, in Latin _repugnans_, from _repugno_, or _re_ and _pugnare_, to fight against, signifies warring with.  
_Adverse_ may be applied to either persons or things; _inimical_ and _hostile_ to persons or things personal; _repugnant_ to things only. A person is _adverse_, or a thing is _adverse_ to an object; a person, or what is personal, is either _inimical_ or _hostile_ to an object; one thing is _repugnant_ to another. We are _adverse_ to a proposition, or circumstances are _adverse_ to our advancement; partisans are _inimical_ to the proceedings of government, and _hostile_ to the possessors of power. In respect to persons, _adverse_ denotes merely the relation of being opposed; _inimical_, the spirit of the individual in private matters; and _hostile_, the situation, conduct, and temper of individuals or bodies in public matters. Those who are _adverse_ to any undertaking are not likely to use their endeavors to insure success; traders will be _inimical_ to the introduction of anything that threatens to be injurious to their trade; some persons are _hostile_ to establishments in religion.  
In respect to things, what is _adverse_ acts to the hindrance or disadvantage of the thing to which it is opposed; as _adverse_ minds, _adverse_ circumstances. Sickness is _adverse_ to the improvement of youth; what is _inimical_ acts directly to injury, as writings which are _inimical_ to religion, a spirit _inimical_ to learning; what is _repugnant_ is in a state of positive opposition or contrariety, as slavery is _repugnant_ to the mild spirit of Christianity.  
**ADVERSE, AVERSE.** — _Adverse_ (see above), signifying turned against or over against, denotes simply opposition of situation. _Averse_, from α and _versus._ signifying turned from or away from, denotes an active removal or separation from. _Adverse_ is therefore as applicable to inanimate as to animate objects; _averse_ only to animate objects. When applied to conscious agents, _adverse_ refers to matters of opinion and sentiment; _averse_ to matters of feeling. One is _adverse_ to that which he thinks wrong; he is _averse_ to that which opposes his inclinations, habits, or interests.  
**ADVERSITY, DISTRESS.** — _Adversity_ signifies adverse circumstances. _Distress_, from the Latin _distringo_, compounded of _dis_, asunder, and _stringo_, I pull, signified tearing to pieces, hence the state of a mind disorganized by grief or fear.  
_Adversity_ respects external circumstances, _distress_ regards either external circumstances or inward feelings. _Adversity_ is opposed to prosperity; _distress_ to ease. _Adversity_ is a general condition; _distress_ a particular state. _Distress_ is properly the highest degree of _adversity._ When a man's affairs go altogether _adverse_ to his wishes and hopes, when accidents deprive him of his possessions or blast his prospects, he is said to be in _adversity;_ but when in addition to this he is reduced to a state of want, deprived of friends and all prospect of relief, his situation is that of real _distress. Adversity_ is trying, _distress_ is overwhelming. Every man is liable to _adversity_, although few are reduced to _distress_ but by their own fault. 

####advertise 
**ADVERTISE, PUBLISH.**  
_Advertise_, from the Latin _adverto_, compounded of _ad_ and _verto_, to turn to, signifies to turn the attention to a thing. _Publish_, in Latin _publico_ — that is, _facere publicum_ — signifies to make public.  
_Advertise_ denotes the means, and _publish_ the end. To _advertise_ is to direct the public attention to any event by means of a printed circular; _publish_ is to make known either by oral or printed communication. We _publish_ by _advertising_, but we do not always _advertise_ when we _publish._ Mercantile and civil transactions are conducted by means of _advertisements._ Extraordinary circumstances are speedily _published_ in a neighborhood by circulating from mouth to mouth. See also [announce](entry://announce)

####advice 
**ADVICE, COUNSEL, INSTRUCTION.**  
_Advice_ (see [admonish](entry://admonish)). _Counsel_, in French _conseil_, Latin _consilium_, comes from _consilio_ (compounded of _con_ and a root which probably meant to sit), signified to come together to talk over something; and in an extended sense implies deliberation, or the thing deliberated upon, determined, and prescribed. — _instruction_, in French _instruction_, Latin _instructio_, building, signified to build up from within, and is used in this literal sense by Milton: _"Instruct_ me, for Thou knowest, " meaning "Enter into me and build up my spirit from within. "  
The end of all the actions implied by these words is the communication of knowledge, and all of them include the accessory idea of superiority, either of age, station, knowledge, or talent. _Advice_ flows from superior professional knowledge, or an acquaintance with things in general; _counsel_ regards superior wisdom, or a superior acquaintance with moral principles and practice; _instruction_ respects superior local knowledge in particular transactions. A medical man gives _advice_ to his patient; a father gives _counsel_ to his children; a counsellor gives _advice_ to his client in points of law; he receives _instructions_ from him in matters of fact. _Advice_ should be prudent and cautious; _counsel_ sage and deliberative; _instructions_ clear and positive. _Advice_ is given on all the concerns of life, important or otherwise; _counsel_ is employed for grave and weighty matters; _instruction_ is used on official occasions. Men of business are best able to give _advice_ in mercantile transactions. In all measures that involve our future happiness, it is prudent to take the _counsel_ of those who are more experienced than ourselves. An ambassador must not act without _instructions_ from his court. See also **information** under [inform](entry://inform)

_Aeronaut_, in French _aéronaute_, from Latin _aer_, the air, and _nauta_, a sailor, as a general term, any one who navigates the air. _Aerial navigator_ and _aerial pilot_ are terms used to distinguish the one who guides an aircraft from the crew having other duties. _Aviator_ is applied to any one engaged in aerial flights, but is more akin to _aerial navigator. Balloonist_, strictly an aviator who makes ascensions in a balloon or a lighter-than-air craft, usually an elongated or spherical bag inflated with gas — the original flying-machine. 

####aeronautics 
**AERONAUTICS, AEROSTATICS, AEROSTATION, AVIATION, BALLOONING.**  
_Aeronautics_, in French _aéronautique_, the science or art which treats of aerial navigation. _Aerostatic_, in German _aerostatik_, in French _aérostatique_, "standing in the air, " and _aérostation_ both relate to air at rest and specifically to the suspension and control of flying-craft in the air. _Aviation_, from the Latin _avis_, a bird, applies both to the science of aerial flight in general and particularly to the use of machines capable of rising and maintaining themselves in the air without the aid of gas or rarefied air. _Balloon_, allied to _ball_, meant originally a large spherical bag, and _ballooning_ differs from _aviation_ as here defined in that it applies to a machine deriving its ascending and sustaining power from gas or rarefied air contained in a huge bag. A _captive balloon_ is one used for observation purposes over a limited area, and is attached by a rope or cable to a holding object on the ground. It was formerly used for scouting in warfare, but has given way to other forms of aircraft.

####affable 
**AFFABLE, COURTEOUS.**  
_Affable_, in Latin _affabilis_, from _af_ or _ad_, to, and _fari_, to speak, signifies ready to speak or be spoken with, and is particularly applied to persons in a higher condition; princes and nobles are commonly said to be _affable_ when they converse freely with those not in the same condition.  
_Affability_ is properly confined to verbal communications; but _courteousness_, from the word _court_, signifying after the manner of a court or courtier, refers to actions and manners; _affability_ flows from the natural temper; _courteousness_ from good breeding, or the acquired temper. 

####affair 
**AFFAIR, BUSINESS, CONCERN.**  
_Affair_, in French _affaire_, is formed from the phrase _à faire_, corresponding to English _do_, etc., in such phrases as "much _ado, "_ "a great _to do, "_ etc. _Business_, from _busy_ (see [active](entry://active)), signifies the thing that makes or interests a person or with which he is busy or occupied. _Concern_, in French _concerner_, Latin _concerne_, compounded of _con_ and _cernere_, to sift, cognate with Greek _κρίνειν_, whence our words _critic, criticism_, are derived, signifies the sifting out of things that belong together.  
An _affair_ is what happens; a _business_ is what busies; a _concern_ is what is felt. An _affair_ is general; it respects one, many, or all: every _business_ and _concern_ is. an _affair_, though not _vice versa. Business_ and _concern_ are personal; _business_ is that which engages the attention; _concern_ is that which interests the feelings, prospects, and condition, advantageously or otherwise. An _affair_ is important; a _business_ is serious; a _concern_ momentous. The usurpation of power is an _affair_ which interests a nation; the adjusting a difference is a _business_ most suited to the ministers of religion; to make one's peace with one's Maker is the _concern_ of every individual. _Affairs_ are administered; _business_ is transacted; _concerns_ are managed. The _affairs_ of the world are administered by a Divine Providence. Those who are in the practice of the law require peculiar talents to fit them for transacting the complicated _business_ which perpetually offers itself. Some men are so involved in the _affairs_ of this world as to forget the _concerns_ of the next, which ought to be nearest and dearest to them. 

####affect 
**AFFECT, CONCERN.**  
_Affect_, in French _affecter_, Latin _affectum_, participle of _afficio_, compounded, of _ad_ and _facere_, to do or act, signifies to act upon. _Concern_, for derivation see under AFFAIR.  
Things _affect_ us which produce any change in our outward circumstances; they _concern_ us if connected with our circumstances in any shape. Whatever _affects_ must _concern;_ but all that _concerns_ does not _affect._ The price of corn _affects_ the interest of the seller; and therefore it concerns him to keep it up, without regard to the public good or injury. Things _affect_ either persons or things; but they _concern_ persons only. Rain _affects_ the hay or corn; and these matters _concern_ every one more or less.  
_Affect_ and _concern_ have an analogous meaning likewise when taken for the influence on the mind. We are _affected_ by things when our _affections_ only are awakened by them: we are _concerned_ when our understanding and wishes are engaged. We may be _affected_ either with joy or sorrow: we are _concerned_ only in a painful manner. People of tender sensibility are easily _affected:_ irritable people are _concerned_ about trifles. It is natural for every one to be _affected_ at the recital of misfortunes; but there are people of so cold and selfish a character as not to be _concerned_ about anything which does not immediately _affect_ their own persons or property.  
**AFFECT, ASSUME.**  
_Affect_, in this sense, derives its origin immediately from the Latin _affecto_, desire eagerly, signifying to aim at or aspire after. _Assume_, in Latin _assume_, compounded of _ad_ and _sumere_, to take, signifies to take to one's self.  
To _affect_ is to use forced efforts to appear to have that which one has not; to _assume_ is to appropriate to one's self that which one has no right to have. One _affects_ to have fine feelings, and _assumes_ great importance. _Affectation_ springs from the desire of appearing better than we really are; _assumption_ from the thinking ourselves better than we really are. We _affect_ the virtues which we have not; we _assume_ the character which does not belong to us. An _affected_ person is always thinking of others; an _assuming_ person thinks only of himself. The _affected_ man strives to gain applause by appearing to be what he is not; the _assuming_ man demands respect upon the ground of what he supposes himself to be. Hypocrisy is often the companion of _affectation_, self-conceit always that of _assumption._  
To _affect_ is always taken in a bad sense; but to _assume_ may be sometimes an indifferent action at least, if not justifiable. Men always _affect_ that which is supposed to please others, in order to gain their applause; but they sometimes _assume_ a name or an authority which is no more than their just right.  
**AFFECT, PRETEND.** — _Affect_, see above. _Pretend_, in Latin _pretendo_ — that is, _prœ_ and _tendo_ — signifies to hold or stretch one thing before another by way of a blind.  
These terms are synonymous only in the bad sense of setting forth to others what is not real: we _affect_ by putting on a false air; we _pretend_ by making a false declaration. Art is employed in _affecting;_ assurance and self-complacency in _pretending._ A person _affects_ not to hear what it is convenient for him not to answer; he _pretends_ to have forgotten what it is convenient for him not to recollect. One _affects_ the manners of a gentleman, and _pretends_ to gentility of birth. One _affects_ the character and habits of a scholar; one _pretends_ to learning. To _affect_ the qualities which we have not spoils those which we have; to _pretend_ to attainments which we have not made obliges us to have recourse to falsehoods in order to escape detection.

**AFFECTED, DISPOSED.** — _Affected_ signifies moved or acted upon by any particular circumstance, as to be _affected_ at any spectacle. _Disposed_, from _dispose_, to settle or put in order, signifies settled or determined as to one's purpose; as _disposed_ to do a good turn.  
_Affected_ likewise signifies to be _affected_ with a particular sentiment, which brings it nearer to the sense of _disposed_ in denoting a state of mind, but _disposed_ in this case implies a settled if not an habitual temper, _affection_ a temporary and partial state: subjects are either well or ill _affected_ to their government; people are either well or ill _disposed_ as regards their moral character or principles.

####affection 
**AFFECTION, LOVE.**  
_Affection_, from the verb _affect_, denotes the state of being kindly _affected_ toward a person. _Love_, German _liebe_, like the English _lief_, German _lieb_, dear or pleasing, is connected with the Latin _libet_, it is pleasing, signifying the state of holding a person dear.  
These two words are comparable, inasmuch as they denote a sentiment toward any object: they differ both in the nature of the object and the nature of the sentiment. _Affection_ is private or confined to one or more particular individuals; _love_ is either general or particular: it either embraces all objects capable of awakening the sentiment, or it is confined to particular objects: in the former case _love_ expresses the sentiment of the Divine Being toward all His creatures, and also that of man to the rest__ of his fellow-creatures.  
When applied to particular objects, _love_ is a much warmer sentiment than _affection._ The latter subsists between persons of the same sex, the former in a particular manner between persons of a different sex. _Affection_ is a tender and durable sentiment, a chastened feeling under the control of the understanding which promises no more pleasure than it gives; _love_ is an ardent sentiment which, as between the sexes, has all the characteristics of a passion, being exclusive, restless, and fluctuating. _Love_ may subsist before marriage, but it must terminate in _affection_ in order to insure happiness after marriage.  
Between the words _affection_ and _love_ there is this further distinction, that the former did not always imply a kindly or favorable sentiment; there may be an ill as well as a good _affection:_ the _affections_ of a people to a government may be various; the _affection_ of a prince may change from favor to disfavor toward a subject.   
See also [attachment](entry://attachment)  
**AFFECTIONATE, KIND, FOND.** — _Affectionate_, from _affection_ (see above), denotes the quality of having _affection. Kind,_ from the word _kind_, kindred or family, denotes the quality or feeling engendered by the family tie. _Fond_ is the past participle of Middle English _fonnen_, to be weak, to act like a fool.  
_Affectionate_ characterizes the feeling; _kind_ has mostly a reference to the action: _affectionate_ is directed to a particular object; _kind_ to objects generally. Relations are _affectionate_ to one another, persons may be _kind_ to any one, even to mere strangers.  
So toward animals generally we may be _kind_, and toward favorite animals _affectionate._  
As epithets, these words observe the same distinction; a mother or a child is _affectionate_, a master _kind;_ looks, or whatever serve to express _affection_, are said most appropriately to be _affectionate;_ offices, or any actions prompted by the general sentiment of _kindness_, arc called kind.  
_Affectionate_ and _kind_ are always taken in the good sense for a proper sentiment; _fondness_ is an excess of liking for any object, which, whether it be a person or a thing, is more or less reprehensible; children are always _fond_ of whatever affords them pleasure or of whoever gives them indulgences. 

####affinity 
See ALLIANCE; KIN-deed. 

####affirm 
**AFFIRM, ASSEVERATE, ASSURE, VOUCH, AVER, PROTEST.**  
_Affirm_, in French _affirmer_, Latin _affirmo_, compounded of _ad_ and _firmo_, strengthen, signifies to give strength to what has been said. _Asseverate_, in Latin _asseveratus_, participle of _assevero_, compounded of _ad_ and _severus_, signifies to make a serious statement. _Assure_, in French _assurer_, is compounded of the intensive syllable _as_ or _ad_ and _securus_ (English secure), safe, signifying to make sure. _Vouch_ is probably changed from _vow. Aver_, in French _avérer_, is compounded of the intensive syllable _a_ or _ad_ and _verus_, true, signifying to bear testimony to the truth. _Protest_, in French _protester_, Latin _proteste_, is compounded of _pro_ and _tester_, to call to witness as to what we think about a thing. All these terms indicate an expression of a person's conviction.  
In one sense, to _affirm_ is to declare that a thing is, in opposition to denying or declaring that it is not; in the sense here chosen, it signifies to declare a thing as a fact on our credit. To _asseverate_ is to declare it with confidence. To _vouch_ is to rest the truth of another's declaration on our own responsibility. To _aver_ is to express the truth of a declaration unequivocally. To _protest_ is to declare a thing solemnly, and with strong marks of sincerity. _Affirmations_ are made of the past and present; a person _affirms_ what he has seen and what he sees. _Asseverations_ are strong _affirmations_, made in cases of doubt to remove every impression disadvantageous to one's sincerity. _Assurances_ are made of the past, present, and future; they mark the conviction of the speaker as to what has been, or is, and his intentions as to what shall be; they are appeals to the estimation which another has in one's word. _Vouching_ is an act for another; it is the supporting of another's _assurance_ by our own. _Averring_ is employed in matters of fact; we _aver_ as to the accuracy of details; we _aver_ on positive knowledge that sets aside all question. _Protestations_ are stronger than either _asseverations_ or _assurances_, they are accompanied with every act, look, or gesture that can tend to impress conviction on another.  
_Affirmations_ are employed in giving evidence, whether accompanied with an oath or not; liars deal much in _asseverations_ and _protestations._ People _asseverate_ in order to produce a conviction of their veracity; they _protest_ in order to obtain a belief of their innocence; they _aver_ where they expect to be believed. _Assurances_ are altogether personal; they are always made to satisfy some one of what they wish to know and believe. We ought to be sparing of our _assurances_ of regard for another. Whenever we _affirm_ anything on the authority of another, we ought to be particularly cautious not to _vouch_ for its veracity if it be not unquestionable.

**AFFIRM, ASSERT.** — _Affirm_ (see above). _Assert_, in Latin _assertus_, participle of _assero_, compounded of _ad_ and _sero_, to connect, signifies to connect words into a proposition. To _affirm_ is said of facts; to _assert_, of opinions; we _affirm_ what we know; we assert what we believe. Whoever _affirms_ what he does not know to be true is guilty of falsehood; whoever _asserts_ what he cannot prove to be true is guilty of folly. We contradict an _affirmation;_ we confute an _assertion._

####affix 
**AFFIX, SUBJOIN, ATTACH, ANNEX.**  
_Affix_, in Latin _affixus_, participle of _affigo_, compounded of _af_ or _ad_ and _figo_, to fix, signifies to fix to a thing. _Subjoin_ comes from Latin _sub_, under, and _jungere_, to join, and means to join to the lower or farther extremity of a body. _Attach_ (see [adhere](entry://adhere)), to _adhere. Annex_, in Latin _annexus_, participle of _annecto_, compounded of _an_ or _ad_ and _necto_, to knit, signifies to knit or tie to a thing.  
To _affix_ is to put anything as an essential to any whole; to _subjoin_ is to put anything as a subordinate part to a whole: in the former case, the part to which it is put is not specified; in the latter, the syllable _sub_ specifies the extremity as the part: to _attach_ is to make one person or thing _adhere_ to another by a particular tie, mostly in the moral sense; to _annex_ is to bring things into a general connection with each other. A title is _affixed_ to a book; a few fines are _subjoined_ to a letter by way of postscript; we _attach_ blame to a person; a certain territory is _annexed_ to a kingdom. Letters are _affixed_ to words in order to modify their sense, or names are _affixed_ to ideas; it is necessary to _subjoin_ remarks to what requires illustration; we are apt from prejudice or particular circumstances to _attach_ disgrace to certain professions which are not only useful, but important; papers are _annexed_ by way of appendix to some important transaction. 

####afflict 
**AFFLICT, DISTRESS, TROUBLE.**  
_Afflict_, in Latin _afflictus_, participle of _affligo_, compounded of _ad_, to, and _fligere_, to dash, signifies to strike to the ground. For _distress_ see **adversity** under [adverse](entry://adverse). _Trouble_ signifies to causé a tumult, from the Latin _turba_, Greek _τύρβη_, a tumult.  
When these terms relate to outward circumstances, the first expresses more than the second, and the second more than the third. People are _afflicted_ with grievous maladies. The mariner is _distressed_ for want of water in the midst of the wide ocean; or an embarrassed tradesman is _distressed_ for money to maintain his credit. The mechanic is _troubled_ for want of proper tools, or the head of a family for want of good domestics.  
When they respect the inward feelings _afflict_ conveys the idea of deep sorrow; _distress_ that of sorrow mixed with anxiety; _trouble_ that of pain in a smaller degree. The death of a parent _afflicts;_ the misfortunes of our family and friends _distress;_ crosses in trade and domestic inconveniences _trouble._ In the season of _affliction_ prayer affords the best consolation and surest support. The assistance and sympathy of friends serve to relieve _distress._ We may often help ourselves out of our _troubles_, and remove the evil by patience and perseverance. _Afflictions_ may be turned to benefits if they lead a man to turn inwardly into himself and examine the state of his heart and conscience in the sight of his Maker. The _distresses_ of human life often serve only to enhance the value of our pleasures when we regain them. Among the _troubles_ with which we are daily assailed, many of them are too trifling for us to be _troubled_ by them.  
**AFFLICTION, GRIEF, SORROW.** — _Affliction_ (see [afflict](entry://afflict)). _Grief_, Old French _grief_, comes from Latin _gravus_, heavy, burdensome, sad. _Sorrow_, in German _sorge_, etc., originally signified care, as well as sorrow.  
All these words mark a state of suffering which differs either in the degree or the cause, or in both. _Affliction_ is much stronger than _grief;_ it lies deeper in the soul, and arises from a more powerful cause; the loss of what is most dear, the continued sickness of our friends, or a reverse of fortune, will all cause _affliction;_ the misfortunes of others, the failure of our favorite schemes, the troubles of our country, will occasion us _grief. Sorrow is_ less than grief; it arises from the untoward circumstances which perpetually arise in life. A disappointment, the loss of a game, our own mistake, or the negligence of others causes _sorrow. Affliction_ lies too deep to be vehement; it discovers itself by no striking marks in the exterior; it is lasting, and does not cease when the external causes cease to act; _grief_ may be violent, and discover itself by loud and indecorous signs; it is transitory, and ceases even before the cause which gave birth to it: _sorrow_ discovers itself by a simple expression; it is still more transient than _grief_, not existing beyond the moment in which it is produced. A person of a tender mind is _afflicted_ at the remembrance of his sins; he is _grieved_ at the consciousness of his fallibility and proneness to error; he is _sorry_ for the faults which he has committed. _Affliction_ is allayed: _grief_ subsides: _sorrow_ is soothed.

####afford 
**AFFORD, YIELD, PRODUCE.**  
_Afford_, Anglo-Saxon _geforthian_ (a__ being a corruption of _ge_, pronounced _ye_, a verbal prefix, added to _forth_, the present English _forth_), meant to cause to come forth, to promote, etc. _Yield_, German _gelten_, in Anglo-Saxon _gildan, gieldan_, means to give the value of something. _Produce_, in Latin _produce_, compounded of _pro_, forth, and _ducere_, to bring, signifies to bring out or into existence.  
With _afford_ is associated the idea of communicating a part or property of some substance to a person, by way of supply to his wants: meat _affords_ nourishment to those who make use of it; the sun _affords_ light and heat to all living creatures.  
To _yield_ is the natural operation of any substance to give up or impart the parts or properties inherent in it; it is the natural surrender which an object makes of itself: trees _yield_ fruit; the seed _yields_ grain; some sorts of grain do not _yield_ much in particular soils, and in an extended application trees may be said to _yield_ a shade.  
_Produce_ conveys the idea of one thing causing another to exist, or to spring out of it; it is a species of creation, the formation of a new substance: the earth _produces_ a variety of fruits; confined air will _produce_ an explosion.  
In the moral application they are similarly distinguished: nothing _affords_ so great a scope for ridicule as the follies of fashion; nothing _yields_ so much satisfaction as religion; nothing _produces so_ much mischief as the vice of drunkenness.  
See also [give](entry://give)  
**AFFORD, SPARE.** — _Afford_ (see above)  
_Spare_, in German _sparen_, Latin _parco_, signifies laying aside for some particular use.  
The idea of deducting from one's property with convenience is common to these terms; but _afford_ respects solely expenses which are no more than commensurate with our income; _spare_ is said of things in general, which we may part with without any sensible diminution of our comfort. There are few so destitute that they cannot _afford_ something for the relief of others who are more destitute. He who has two things of a kind may easily _spare_ one. 

####affray 
See [quarrel](entry://quarrel)

####affront 
**AFFRONT, INSULT, OUTRAGE.**  
_Affront_, in French _affronte_, from the Latin _ad_ and _frons_, the forehead, signifies flying in the face of a person. _Insult_, in French _insulte_, comes from the Latin _insulto_, meaning literally "to jump on. " The former of these actions marks defiance, the latter scorn and triumph. _Outrage_ is compounded of the French adverb _outre_ and the suffix _rage_, and signifies to go beyond bounds.  
An _affront_ is a mark of reproach shown in the presence of others; it piques and mortifies: an _insult_ is an attack made with insolence; it irritates and provokes: an _outrage_ combines all that is offensive; it wounds and injures. An intentional breach of politeness is an _affront;_ if coupled with any external indication of hostility, it is an _insult;_ if it break forth into personal violence, it is an _outrage._ Captious people construe every innocent freedom into an _affront._ When people are in a state of animosity they seek opportunities of offering one another _insults._ Intoxication or violent passion impels men to the commission of _outrages._  
See also [offence](entry://offence)

####afraid 
**AFRAID, FEARFUL, TIMOROUS, TIMID.**  
_Afraid_ is changed from _afeard_, signifying in a state of fear. _Fearful_, as the words of which it is compounded imply, signifies full of fear. _Timorous_ and _timid_ come from the Latin _timidus_, fearful, _timor_, fear, and _timere_, to fear.  
The first of these epithets denotes a temporary state, the last three a habit of the mind. _Afraid_ may be used either in a physical or moral application, either as it relates to ourselves Duly or to others; _fearful_ and _timorous_ are applied only physically and personally; _timid_ is mostly used in a moral sense. It is the character of the _fearful_ or _timorous_ person to be _afraid_ of what he imagines would hurt himself; it is not necessary for the prospect of danger to exist in order to awaken fear in such a disposition; it is the characteristic of the _timid_ person to be _afraid_ of offending or meeting with something painful from others; a person of such a disposition is prevented from following the dictates of his own mind. Between _fearful_ and _timorous_ there is little distinction, either in sense or application, except that we say _fearful_ of a thing, not _timorous_ of a thing. 

####after 
**AFTER, BEHIND.**  
_After_ respects order; _behind_ respects position. One runs _after_ a person, or stands _behind_ his chair. _After_ is used either figuratively or literally; _behind_ is used only literally. Men hunt _after_ amusements; misfortunes come _after_ one another; a garden lies _behind_ a house; a thing is concealed _behind_ a bush.

####aggravate 
**AGGRAVATE, IRRITATE, PROVOKE, EXASPERATE, TANTALIZE.**  
_Aggravate_, in Latin _aggravatus_, participle of _aggrave_, compounded of the intensive syllable _ad_ and _gravo_, make heavy, signifies to make very heavy. _Irritate_, in Latin _irritatus_, participle of _irrito_, snarl, is a word of uncertain origin. It may be a frequentative of _irrire_, to snarl like a dog, which is possibly an imitative word. _Provoke_, in French _provoquer_, Latin _provoco_, compounded of _pro_, forth, and _voco_, call, signifies, to challenge or defy. _Exasperate_, Latin _exasperatus_, participle of _exaspère_, is compounded of the intensive syllable _ex_ and _asper_, rough, signifying to make things exceedingly rough. _Tantalize_, in French _tantaliser_, Greek _ταντάλιζω_, comes from _Tantalus_, a Icing of Phrygia, who, having offended the gods, was destined, by way of punishment, to stand up to his chin in water, with a tree of fair fruit hanging over his head, both of which, as he attempted to allay his hunger and thirst, fled from his touch. All these words, except the first, refer to the feelings of the mind, and in familiar discourse that also bears the same signification, but otherwise respects the outward circumstances. The crime of robbery is _aggravated_ by any circumstances of cruelty; whatever comes across the feelings _irritates;_ whatever awakens anger _provokes;_ whatever heightens this anger extraordinarily _exasperates;_ whatever raises hopes in order to frustrate them _tantalizes._ An appearance of unconcern for the offence and its consequences _aggravates_ the guilt of the offender; a grating, harsh sound _irritates_, if long continued and often repeated; angry words _provoke_, particularly when spoken with an air of defiance: when to this are added bitter taunts and multiplied provocations, they _exasperate;_ the weather, by its frequent changes, _tantalizes_ those who depend upon it for amusement. Wicked people _aggravate_ their transgression by violence; susceptible and nervous people are most easily _irritated;_ proud people are quickly _provoked;_ hot and fiery people are soonest _exasperated;_ those who wish for much, and wish for it eagerly, are oftenest _tantalized._

####aggressor 
**AGGRESSOR, ASSAILANT.**  
_Aggressor_, from the Latin _aggressus_, participle of _aggredior_, compounded of _ag_ or _ad_ and _gradi_, to step, signifies one stepping up to, falling upon, or attacking. _Assailant_ comes from _assail_, in French _assaillir_, compounded of _ad_ and the Latin _salio_, to leap upon, and signifies one leaping upon or attacking any one vehemently. Compare the origin of _insult._  
The characteristic idea of _aggression is_ that of one person going up to another in a hostile manner, and by a natural extension of the sense commencing an attack: the characteristic idea of _assailing_ is that of one committing an act of violence upon another. An _aggressor_ offers to do some injury either by word or deed; an _assailant_ actually commits some violence: the former commences a dispute; the latter carries it on with a vehement and direct attack. An _aggressor_ is blamable for giving rise to quarrels: an _assailant_ is culpable for the mischief he does. Were there no _aggressors_, there would be no disputes; were there no _assailants_, those disputes would not be serious. An _aggressor_ may be an _assailant_, or an _assailant_ may be an _aggressor_, but they are as frequently distinct.

####agitation 
**AGITATION, TREPIDATION, TREMOR, EMOTION.**  
_Agitation_, in Latin _agitatio_, from _agito_, a frequentative of _ago_, act, signifies the state of being _agitated_ or put into action. _Trepidation_, in Latin _trepidatio_, from _trepidare_, to tremble, signifies the condition of trembling in all one's limbs from head to foot. _Tremor_, from the Latin _tremor_, signifies originally the same state of trembling. _Emotion_, in Latin _emotio_, from _emotus_, participle of _emoveo_, compounded of _e_, out of, and _movere_, to move, signifies the state of being moved out of rest or put in motion.  
_Agitation_ is a violent action backward and forward and in different ways. It may be applied either to the body or the mind; the body may be _agitated_ or thrown into violent and irregular motion, cither by external action upon it, or by the operations of grief, terror, or any other passion; the mind is _agitated_ when the thoughts or the feelings are put into any violent or irregular motion. _Trepidation_, like the former, is an irregular motion of the body, but differs both in the manner and cause of the motion; _trepidation_ is the hurried trembling motion of the limbs in performing their functions, whence we speak of doing a tiling with _trepidation_, or that there is a _trepidation_ in a person's manner: in all cases it arises from a sentiment of fear or alarm.  
_Agitation_ and _trepidation_ may be both applied to bodies of men as well as individuals, with a similar distinction.  
_Tremor_ is a trembling motion of the body, differing from the two former either in the force or the causes of the action: it is not violent nor confined to any particular part, like _trepidation_, and may, like _agitation_, arise either from physical or mental causes. There may be a _tremor_ in the whole body, or a _tremor_ in the voice, and the like.  
_Emotion_ refers solely to the movements of the mind, and is therefore to be compared only with _agitation. Emotion_ is the movement of a single feeling, varying with the object that awakens it; there may be _emotions_ of pleasure as well as of pain; _agitation_ may be the movement of one or many feelings, but those always of the painful land. _Emotions_ may be strong, but not violent: _agitation_ will always be more or less violent.

_Agree_, from the Old French phrase _à gre_, at pleasure, from Latin _gratia_, signifies to be in a pleasant relation to another, to like something. _Accede_, in Latin _accedo, ac_ or _ad_ and _cedo_, go or come, signifies to come toward another. _Consent_, from _consentie_, or _con, cum_, with, together, and _sentio_, think or feel, signifies to think or feel in unison. _Comply_, in French _complaire_, Latin _compleo_ (for derivation see [compliment](entry://compliment)), signifies to fulfil all expectations, to satisfy the demands of another. _Acquiesce_, in Latin _acquiesco_, or _ac, ad_, to or with, and _quiesco_, be quiet, signifies rest contented with.  
All of these terms denote the falling in of any one or more persons in any matter that comes before their notice. _Agree_ expresses this general idea without any qualifications; all the other terms express different modes of _agreeing._ All may _agree_ in the same thing, or one may _agree_ to that which is proposed; _acceding, complying_, and _acquiescing_ are the acts of persons individually, _consenting_ is properly the act of numbers, but it is also the act of individuals; one _accedes_ to, _complies_ with, or _acquiesces_ in a thing. _Agreeing_ is often a casual act not brought about by the parties themselves; the other terms denote positive acts, varying in the motives and circumstances. We _accede_ by becoming a party to a thing: those who _accede_ are on equal terms; one objects to that to which one does not _accede;_ we _consent_ to a thing by authorizing it, we _comply_ with a tiling by allowing it; those who _consent_ or _comply_ are not on equal terms with those in whose favor the _consent_ is given or _compliance_ made; _consenting_ is an act of authority, _complying_ an act of good nature or weakness; one refuses that to which one does not _consent_, or with which one does not _comply;_ to _acquiesce_ is quietly to admit; it is a passive act, dictated by prudence or duty; one opposes that in which one does not _acquiesce._  
To _agree_ is to be of the same mind in matters of opinion or feeling; it is well for those who act together to be able to _agree._  
The term _agree_ is, however, commonly used in regard to acting, as well as thinking, in the ordinary transactions of life.  
To _accede_ and the other terms are with very few exceptions employed in practical matters, but sometimes otherwise; to _accede_ is mostly said in regard to that which is in a special manner proposed, if not recommended; as a private individual _accedes_ to a proposition; a plenipotentiary _accedes_ to a__ treaty.  
To _consent_, as far as it is a universal act, is applied to moral objects; as customs are introduced by the _consent_ of the community; but as the act of one or more individuals, it is applied to such practical matters as interest the parties for themselves or others; the parliament _consents_ to the measures of the ministry; a parent _consents_ to the marriage of a child. Equals _consent to_ that in which they have a common interest.  
_Complying_ is used in the sense of yielding to the requests, demands, or wishes of another for the sake of conformity, and sometimes in the general sense of yielding to the wishes of the community.  
To _acquiesce_ is applied in the sense of yielding or agreeing to that which _is_ decided upon by others. In this sense we _acquiesce_ in the dispensations of Providence.  
**AGREE, ACCORD, SUIT.** — _Agree_ is here used in application to things only. _Accord_, in French _accord_, from the Latin _cors, cordis_, heart, signifies literally "heart to heart, " in hearty agreement. _Suit_, from the Latin _secutus_, participle of _sequor_, follow, signifies to be in a fine, in the order a thing ought to be.  
An _agreement_ between two things requires an entire sameness; an _accord_ once supposes a considerable resemblance; a _suitableness_ implies an aptitude to coalesce. Opinions _agree_, feelings _accord_, and tempers _suit._ Two statements _agree_ which are in all respects alike; that _accords_ with our feelings which produces pleasurable sensations; that _suits_ our taste which we wish to adopt, or, in adopting, gives us pleasure. Where there is no _agreement_ in the essentials of any two accounts, their authenticity may be greatly questioned: if a representation of anything _accords_ with what has been stated from other quarters, it serves to corroborate it: it is advisable that the ages and stations as well as tempers of the parties should be _suitable_ who look forward for happiness in a matrimonial connection.  
**AGREE, COINCIDE, CONCUR.** — _Agree_ is here taken in its application to both persons and things. It is as before the general term. _Coincide_, from the Latin _con_, together, and _incido_, fall, means literally "to fall in with. " _Concur_, from _con_, together, and _curro_, run, implying a running in the same course, an acting together on the same principles, or modes of agreeing.  
In respect to persons, they _agree_ either in their general or particular opinions; they _coincide_ and _concur_ only in particular opinions. A person _coincides_ in opinion with another in regard to speculative matters, but _concurs_ with another in regard to practical matters; to _coincide_ is only to meet at the same point, but to _concur_ is to go together in the same road or in the same course of conduct.  
In respect to things, they _agree_ in one, many, or every point, as the accounts of different persons, times, modes, and circumstances _agree;_ things _coincide_ or meet at one point, as where two circumstances fall out at the same time; this is a _coincidence;_ things _concur_ if they have the same tendency or lead to the same point; several circumstances must sometimes _concur_ to bring about any particular event. The _coincidence_ is mostly accidental, the _concurrence_ depends upon the nature of things.

####agreeable 
**AGREEABLE, PLEASANT, PLEASING.**  
The first two of these epithets approach so near in sense and application that they can with propriety be used indifferently, the one for the other; yet there is an occasional difference which may be clearly defined. The _agreeable_ is that which agrees with or suits the character, temper, and feelings of a person; the _pleasant_ that which pleases; the _pleasing_ that which is adapted to please. _Agreeable_ expresses a feeling less vivid than _pleasant;_ people of the soberest and gravest character may talk of passing _agreeable_ hours, or enjoying _agreeable_ society, if those hours were passed _agreeably_ to their turn of mind, or that society suited their taste; but the young and the gay will prefer _pleasant_ society, where vivacity and mirth prevail, suitable to the tone of their spirits. A man is _agreeable_ who by a soft and easy address contributes to the amusement of others; a man is _pleasant_ who to this softness adds affability and communicativeness. _Pleasing_ marks a sentiment less vivid and distinctive than either. A _pleasing_ voice has something in it which we like; an _agreeable_ voice strikes with positive pleasure upon the ear. A _pleasing_ countenance denotes tranquillity and contentment; it satisfies us when we view it: a _pleasant_ countenance bespeaks happiness; it gratifies the beholder, and invites him to look upon it.

####agreement 
**AGREEMENT, CONTRACT, COVENANT, COMPACT, BARGAIN.**  
_Agreement_ signifies what is agreed to. _Contract_, in French _contrat_, from the Latin _contractus_, participle of _contraho_, draw close together or bind, signifies the thing thus contracted or bound. _Covenant_, in Old French _covenant_, from the present participle of _convenio_, meet together, signifies the point at which several meet, that is, the thing agreed upon by many. _Compact_, in Latin _compactus_, participle of _compingo_, bind close, signifies the thing to which people bind themselves close. _Bargain_ comes from Late Latin _barcaniare_, to change about. Its remote origin is unknown.  
An _agreement_ is general, and applies to transactions of every description, but particularly such as are made between single individuals, in cases where the other terms are not so applicable; a _contract_ is a binding _agreement_ between individuals; a simple _agreement_ may be verbal, but a _contract_ must be written and legally executed: _covenant_, in the technical sense, is an _agreement_ by deed, but in the general sense a solemn _agreement;_ a _compact_ is an _agreement_ among numbers; a _covenant_ may be a national and public transaction; a _compact_ respects individuals as members of a community, or communities with each other who are _compacted_ together: a _bargain_, in its proper sense, is an _agreement_ solely in matters of trade, but applies figuratively in the same sense to other objects. The simple consent of parties constitutes an _agreement;_ certain solemnities are necessary to make a _contract_ or _covenant_ valid; a tacit sense of mutual obligation in all the parties gives virtue to a _compact;_ an assent to stipulated terms of sale may form a _bargain._  
Friends make an _agreement_ to meet at a certain time; two tradesmen enter into a _contract_ to carry on a joint trade; and if it be under hand and seal, the stipulations therein contained are technically called _covenants;_ in the Society of Freemasons, every individual is bound to secrecy by a solemn _compact;_ the trading part of the community are continually striking _bargains._

####aim 
**AIM, OBJECT, END, VIEW.**  
_Aim_ is mostly derived from the Latin _œstimare_, to put a value on, signifying the thing valued, consequently the particular point to which one's efforts are directed, which is held always in view, and to the attainment of which everything is made to bend. _Object_, from the Latin _objectus_, participle of _ob_ and _jacio_, throw in the way, is more vague; it signifies the thing that lies before us; we pursue it by taking the necessary means to obtain it; it becomes the fruit of our labor. _End_, Anglo-Saxon _ende_, a Teutonic word meaning termination, is still more general, signifying the thing that ends one's wishes and endeavors; it is the result not only of action, but of combined action; it is the consummation of a scheme; we must take the proper measures to arrive at it.  
The _aim_ is that which the person has in his own mind: it depends upon the character of the individual whether it; be good or bad, attainable or otherwise; the _object_ lies in the thing; it is a matter of choice, it depends upon accident as well as design, whether it be worthy or unworthy; the _end_ is that which follows or terminates any course or proceeding; it depends upon the means taken whether the _end_ is arrived at or not. It is the _aim_ of the Christian to live peaceably; it is a mark of dullness or folly to act without an _object;_ it is sophistry to suppose that the _end_ will justify the means.  
_Aim_ and _view_, from _video_, to see or look at, are both acts of the mind, but the _aim_ is that which the mind particularly sets before itself as a thing to be obtained; the _view_ is, generally speaking, whatever the mind sets before itself, whether by way of opinion or motive; a person's _views_ may be interested or disinterested, correct or false. The _aim_ is practical in its operations; the _view_ is a matter rather of contemplation than of practice.

**AIM, POINT, LEVEL.** — _Aim_, signifying to take aim, is to direct one's aim toward a point. _Point_, Latin _punctum_, from _pungere_, to prick (compare _pungent)_, signifies to direct the sharp end or point of an implement toward something. _Level_ comes from Old French _livel_, from Latin _libella_, a diminutive of _libra_, a balance, and signified an instrument for determining that a thing is horizontal. _Level_, from the adjective _level_, signifies to put one thing on a level or in a line with another.  
_Aim_ expresses more than the other two words, inasmuch as it denotes a direction toward some minute point in an object, and the others imply direction toward the whole objects them selves. We _aim_ at a bird; we _point_; a cannon against a wall; we _level_ a cannon at a wall. _Pointing_ is of course used with most propriety in reference to instruments that have points; it is likewise a less decisive action than either _aiming_ or _leveling._ A stick or a finger may be _pointed_ at. a person, merely out of derision; but a blow is _leveled_ or _aimed_ with an express intent of committing an act of violence.  
The same analogy is kept up in their figurative application. The shafts of ridicule are but too often _aimed_ with little effect against the follies of fashion: remarks which seem merely to _point_ at others, without being expressly addressed to them, have always a bad tendency; it has hitherto been the fate of infidels to _level_ their battery of sneers, declamation, and sophistry against the Christian religion, only to strengthen the conviction of its sublime truths in the minds of mankind at large.  
**AIM, ASPIRE.** — _Aim_ includes efforts as well as views, in obtaining an object. _Aspire_, from _as_ or _ad_, to or after, and _spiro_, breathe, comprehends views, wishes, and hopes to obtain an object.  
We _aim_ at a certain proposed point by endeavoring to gain it; we _aspire_ after that which we think ourselves en-titled to, and flatter ourselves with gaining. Many men _aim_ at riches and honor: it is the lot of but few to _aspire_ to a throne. We _aim_ at what is attainable by ordinary efforts; we _aspire_ after what is great and unusual, and often improper. 

####air 
**AIR, MANNER.**  
_Air_, Latin _aer_, Greek _άήρ_, signifies the atmosphere; and thence, figuratively, the enveloping atmosphere of a personality created by appearance, manner, etc. _Manner_, Old French _manière_, allied to the verb _manier_, to handle, from Latin _manus_, hand, signifies the way of handling something, hence a way of doing.  
_Air_ lies in the whole person; _manner_ is confined to the action or the movement of a single limb. A man has the _air_ of a common person; it discovers itself in all his _manners._ An _air_ strikes at the first glance, whether the person be in motion or at rest; the _manner_ can only be seen when the person is in action; it develops itself on closer observation. Some people have an _air_ about them which displeases; but their _manners_ afterward win upon those who have a further intercourse with them. An _air_ is indicative of a state of mind; it may result either from a natural or habitual mode of thinking: a _manner_ is indicative of the education; it is produced by external circumstances. An _air_ is noble or simple, it marks an elevation or simplicity of character: a _manner_ is rude, rustic, or awkward, for want of culture, good society, and good example. We assume an _air_, and affect a _manner._  
See also [appearance](entry://appearance)  
**AIR, MIEN, LOOK.** — _Air_ (see above). _Mien_ is a word of unknown origin, possibly Celtic, adopted into English from the French. _Look_ signifies properly a mode of looking or appearing (for derivation see [look](entry://look)).  
The exterior of a person is comprehended in the sense of all these words. _Air_ depends not only on the countenance, but the stature, carriage, and action: _mien_ respects the whole outward appearance, not excepting the dress: _look_ depends altogether on the face and its changes. _Air_ marks any settled state of the mind: _mien_ denotes any state of the outward circumstances: _look_ any individual movement of the mind. We may judge by a person's _air_ that he has a confident and fearless mind; we may judge by his sorrowful _mien_ that he has substantial cause for sorrow; and by sorrowful _looks_ that he has some partial or temporary cause for sorrow. We talk of doing anything with a particular _air;_ of having a _mien;_ of giving a _look._ An innocent man will answer his accusers with an _air_ of composure; a person's whole _mien_ sometimes bespeaks his wretched condition; a _look_ is sometimes given to one who acts in concert by way of intimation. 

####aircraft 
**AIRCRAFT, AEROPLANE, BALLOON, BIPLANE, DIRIGIBLE, FLYING-MACHINE, GYROPLANE, HELICOPTER, HYDROPLANE, MONOPLANE, MULTIPLANE, ORNITHOPTER, TAUBE, TRIPLANE, ZEPPELIN. **  
_Aircraft_ is a compound of French _air_, Greek _άήρ_, from a root signifying to blow, meaning the lower atmosphere, and _craft_, a nautical term for vessel.  
The European war which began in 1914 gave a new impetus to the designing and construction of aircraft as an offensive weapon. From the mechanism originally built for pleasure or scientific research there was speedily developed a variety of apparatus that in operation startled and shocked the world, especially those aeroplanes and the Zeppelins that were constructed to drop bombs on an enemy's territory and to carry rifled cannon with which to fight similar hostile craft.  
An _aeroplane_ is a heavier-than-air flying-machine with one or more planes or sustaining surfaces; a _balloon_ is a lighter-than-air construction, elongated or spherical in shape, made of silk or other fabric, and inflated with gas; a _biplane_ is an aeroplane with two sustaining surfaces; a _dirigible_ is a balloon made to travel in any direction by means of a propeller operated by a motor; a _flying-machine_ is the common but indefinite name of any form of aircraft; a _gyroplane_ is a machine combining the features of an aeroplane and a helicopter; a _helicopter_ is a machine that derives its ascending power from a fan wheel; a _hydroplane_ is an aeroplane with a body that enables it to alight on or rise from a water surface; a _monoplane_ is a machine with a single sustaining surface; a _multiplane_ is a machine with two or more sustaining surfaces; an _ornithopter_ is a machine with movable or flapping planes; a _Τaube_ is a German bomb-dropping aeroplane; a _triplane_ is an aeroplane with three sustaining surfaces; a _Zeppelin_ is a German dirigible and passenger-carrying apparatus constructed on the balloon principle, and used in the European war as a raiding bomb-dropper. 

####alacrity 
See [alertness](entry://alertness)

####alarm 
**ALARM, TERROR, FRIGHT, CONSTERNATION.**  
_Alarm_ is probably derived through French from the Italian _all' arme_, to arms, Latin _ad illa arma_, or Low Latin _ad Mas armas_, to the arms. _Terror_, in Latin _terror_, comes from _terreo_, to cause to tremble. _Fright_, Anglo-Saxon _fyrhto_, allied to German _fürchten_, is a widely distributed Germanic word from a root signifying _fear. Consternation_, in Latin, _consternatus_, from _consterna_, strew, scatter on the ground, expresses the mixed emotion of terror and amazement which confounds.  
_Alarm_ springs from any sudden signal that announces the approach of danger. _Terror_ springs from any event or phenomenon that may serve as a prognostic of some catastrophe. It supposes a less distinct view of danger than _alarm_, and affords room to the imagination, which commonly magnifies objects. _Alarm_ therefore makes us run to our defence, and _terror_ disarms us. _Fright_ is a less vivid emotion than either, as it arises from the simple appearance of danger. It is more personal than either _alarm_ or _terror;_ for we may be _alarmed_ or _terrified_ for others, but we are mostly _frightened_ for ourselves. _Consternation is_ stronger than either _terror_ or _affright;_ it springs from the view of some very serious evil, and commonly affects many. _Alarm_ affects the feelings, _terror_ the understanding, and _fright_ the senses; _consternation_ seizes the whole mind and benumbs the faculties. Cries _alarm;_ horrid spectacles _terrify;_ a tumult _frightens;_ a sudden calamity fills with _consternation._ One is filled with _alarm_, seized with _terror_, overwhelmed with _fright_ or _consternation._ We are _alarmed_ for what we apprehend; we are _terrified_ by what we imagine; we are _frightened_ by what we see; _consternation_ may be produced by what we learn. 

####alertness 
**ALERTNESS, ALACRITY.**  
_Alertness_, from _ales_, a wing, designates corporeal activity or readiness for action. _Alacrity_, from _acer_, sharp, brisk, designates mental activity. We proceed with _alertness_ when the body is in its full vigor; we proceed with _alacrity_ when the mind is in full pursuit of an object.

####all 
**ALL, WHOLE.**  
_All_ is a Germanic word signifying _everything. Whole_, Anglo-Saxon _hal_, allied to German _heil_, and Greek _καλός_; excellent, beautiful, and the English words _hale, health, wholesome_, etc., signified to be sound, well, without fault or blemish, hence complete, entire.  
_All_ respects a number of individuals; _whole_ respects a single body with its components: we have not _all_, if we have not the _whole_ number; we have not the _whole_, if we have not _all_ the parts of which it is composed. It is not within the limits of human capacity to take more than a partial survey of _all_ the interesting objects which the _whole_ globe contains. When applied to spiritual objects in a general sense, _all_ is preferred to _whole;_ but when the object is specific, _whole_ is preferable: thus we say, _all_ hope was post; but, our _whole_ hope rested in this.  
**ALL, EVERY, EACH.** — _All_ is collective; _every_ single or individual; _each_, distributive. _All_ and _every_ are universal in their signification; _each_ is restrictive: the former are used in speaking of great numbers; the latter is applicable to small numbers. _All_ men are not born with the same talent, either in degree or kind; but _every_ man has a talent peculiar to himself; a parent divides his property among his children, and gives to _each_ his due share. 

####allay 
**ALLAY, SOOTHE, APPEASE, MITIGATE, ASSUAGE.**  
To _allay_, Middle English _aleggen_, is properly no more than a French doublet of the word _alleviate_, derived from Latin _ad_ and _levis_, light; hence it means to lighten a burden. _Soothe_, from Anglo-Saxon _soth_, true, winch appears in the phrases "_in sooth, " "forsooth, "_ etc., means to assent to something as being true, hence to humor. _Appease_, in French _apaiser_, is compounded of _ad_ and _pax_, peace, signifying to quiet. _Mitigate_, from _mitis_, meek, gentle, signifies to make gentle or easy to bear. _Assuage_, from Old French _a_ (Latin _ad)_ and _suavis_, sweet, pleasant, cognate with the English _sweet_ (compare the adjective _suave)_, means literally to sweeten.  
All these terms indicate a lessening of something painful. In a physical sense an irritating pain is _allayed;_ a wounded part is _soothed_ by affording ease and comfort. Extreme heat or thirst is _allayed;_ extreme hunger is _appeased;_ a punishment or sentence is _mitigated._  
In a moral sense one _allays_ what is fervid and vehement; one _soothes_ what is distressed or irritated; one _appeases_ what is tumultuous and boisterous; one _mitigates_ the pains of others, or what is rigorous and severe; one _assuages_ grief or afflictions. Nothing is so calculated to _allay_ the fervor of a distempered imagination as prayer and religious meditation: religion has everything in it which can _soothe_ a wounded conscience by presenting it with the hope of pardon, that can _appease_ the angry passions by giving us a sense of our own sinfulness and need of God's pardon, and that can _assuage_ the bitterest griefs by affording us the brightest prospects of future bliss.

####alleviate 
**ALLEVIATE, RELIEVE.**  
For the derivation of _alleviate_ see [allay](entry://allay). _Relieve_, from the Latin _relevo_, is compounded of _re_ and _levo_, lift up, signifying to take away or remove.  
A pain is _alleviated_ by making it less burdensome; a necessity is _relieved_ by supplying what is wanted. _Alleviate_ respects our internal feelings only; _relieve_, our external circumstances. That _alleviates_ which affords ease and comfort; that _relieves_ which removes the pain. It is no _alleviation_ of sorrow to a feeling mind to reflect that others undergo the same suffering; a change of position is a considerable _relief_ to an invalid, wearied with confinement. Condolence and sympathy tend greatly to _alleviate_ the sufferings of our fellow-creatures; it is an essential part of the Christian's duty to _relieve_ the wants of his indigent neighbor.  
See also [abate](entry://abate)

####alliance 
**ALLIANCE, LEAGUE, CONFEDERACY.**  
_Alliance_, in French _alliance_, from the Latin _alligo_, to tie to (compare _ligament)_, signifies the state of being tied. _League_, in French _ligue_, comes from the same verb, _ligo_, bind. _Confederacy_ or confederation, in Latin _confederate_, from _con_ and _fœdus_, an agreement, signifies a joining together under a certain pledge.  
All these terms agree in expressing the union between two or more persons or bodies, but they differ in the nature of the union and the motive for entering into it. _Alliance_ is the most general term, the other two are rather particular terms; an _alliance_ may be entered into either on public grounds as between states, or on private grounds as between families or individuals; a _league_ or _confederacy_ is entered into upon public grounds or for common interests, as a _league_ between nations or states, and a _confederacy_ between smaller powers or between individuals. _Alliances_ are formed for the mutual conveniences of parties, as between states to promote commerce; _leagues_ and _confederacies_ are entered into mostly for purposes of self-defence or common safety against the attacks of a common enemy; but a _league_ is mostly a solemn act between two or more states and for general purposes of safety; and may, therefore, be both defensive and offensive; a _confederacy_ is mostly the temporary act of several uniting in a season of actual danger to resist a common adversary.  
_Alliance_, as regards persons, is always taken in a good sense, and as between families or individuals is mostly matrimonial. _League_ and _confederacy_ are frequently taken in a bad sense; we may speak of a wicked _league_ or an unnatural _league_ between persons of opposite characters for their own private purposes, or a _league_ between beasts for savage purposes; there may be a _confederacy_ between persons to resist a lawful demand or to forward any evil design.  
**ALLIANCE, AFFINITY.** — _Alliance_ (see above). _Affinity_, in Latin _affinitas_, from _ad_ and _finis_, a border, signifies a contiguity of borders.  
An _alliance_ is a union artificially formed between persons; an _affinity_ is a relation which flows from that act as far as the _alliance_ is matrimonial; the _affinity_ is properly that which results from it; when an _alliance_ is formed between persons of different sexes, this necessarily creates an _affinity_ between the relatives of the two parties.  
As respects things, _alliance_ is used figuratively in the same sense to denote their union by an artificial tie; as an _alliance_ between church and state; _affinity_ in this case implies a relation between things by reason of their agreement or resemblance to each other; as an _affinity_ of sounds or an _affinity_ of languages. 

####all-knowing 
See [omniscient](entry://omniscient)

####allot 
**ALLOT, APPOINT, DESTINE.**  
_Allot_ is a hybrid word compounded of the Latin _ad_ and the English word _lot_, a portion. _Appoint_, in French _appointer_, from _ad_ and _pungo_, participle _functus_, signifies to point out or set out in a particular manner for a particular purpose. _Destine_, in French _destiner_, Latin _destino_, compounded of _de_ and a verb from the root _sta_, to stand, signifies to place apart for a particular object.  
The idea of setting apart or selecting is common to these terms; but _allot_ is used only for things, _appoint_ and _destine_ for persons or things. A space of ground is _allotted_ for cultivation, a person is _appointed_ as steward or governor; a youth is _destined_ for a particular profession. _Allotments_ and _appointments_ are made for immediate purposes, _destinations_ for a future purpose; time may be either _allotted, appointed_, or _destined;_ but _allot_ respects indefinite portions of time, as to _allot_ a portion of one's time to religious meditations; _appoint_ respects any particularly defined portion of time, as to _appoint_ an hour of meeting; _destine_ implies a future time purposely fixed, as the _destined_ hour arrived. A space may be _allotted_, because space may be divided into portions; a particular place is _appointed_ for a particular immediate object, or it is _destined_ by some previous determination; as a person _appoints_ the place where a house shall be built; he _destines_ a house for a particular purpose.

####allow 
**ALLOW, GRANT, BESTOW.**  
_Allow_ (see [abate](entry://abate); [admit](entry://admit)). _Grant_, Old French _graunter_ or _creanter_, to assure, from Latin stem _credent_, from _credere_, to trust, is allied on the one hand to the word _guarantee_, on the other to such words as _credible, credulous, credence_, etc. _Bestow_ is compounded of the prefix _be_ and the Anglo-Saxon _stow_, a place, from the root _sta_, whence _stand_ is also derived, and which is closely allied to the English verb _stow._ Hence to _bestow_ signifies to dispose according to one's wishes and convenience.  
That is _allowed_ which may be expected, if not directly required; that is _granted_ which is desired, if not directly asked for; that is _bestowed_ which is wanted as a matter of necessity. What is _allowed_ is a gift sometimes stipulated as to time and quantity, but frequently depends upon the will of the giver; what is _granted_ is sometimes perfectly gratuitous on the part of the giver, but, when _granted_, is not always to be taken back; what is _bestowed_ is occasional, altogether depending on circumstances and disposition of both giver and receiver. Many of the poor are _allowed_ a small sum weekly from the parish. It is as improper to _grant_ a person more than he asks, as it is to ask a person for more than he can _grant._ Alms are very ill _bestowed_ which only serve to encourage beggary and idleness. A _grant_ comprehends in it something more important than an _allowance_, and passes between persons in a higher station; what is _bestowed_ is of less value than either. A father _allows_ his son a yearly sum for his casual expenses, or a master _allows_ his servant a maintenance; kings _grant_ pensions to their officers; governments _grant_ subsidies to one another; relief is _bestowed_ on the indigent.  
In a figurative application, things are _allowed_ either out of courtesy or complaisance; they are _granted_ by way of favor or indulgence; they are _bestowed_ either from necessity or urgent reasons: merit is _allowed;_ a request is _granted;_ attention or applause is _bestowed._

**ALLOWANCE, STIPEND, SALARY, WAGES, HIRE, PAY.** — All these terms denote a stated sum paid according to certain stipulations. _Allowance_, from _allow_ (see [admit](entry://admit)), signifies the thing _allowed. Stipend_, in Latin _stipendium_, from _stips_, a piece of money, signifies money paid. _Salary_, in French _salaire_, Latin _solarium_, comes from _sal_, salt, and meant salt-money, money for salt. (Compare the word _pin-money_ for a similar method of designation.) _Wages_, Old French _gage_, Low Latin _vadium_, signifies something paid for labor. _Hire_ expresses the sum for which one is hired, and _pay_ the sum that is to be _paid._  
An _allowance_ is gratuitous; it ceases at the pleasure of the donor; all the rest are the requital for some supposed service; they cease with the engagement made between the parties. A _stipend_ is more fixed and permanent than a _salary;_ and that than _wages, hire_, or _pay;_ a _stipend_ depends upon the fulfilling of an engagement, rather than on the will of an individual; a _salary_ is a matter of contract between the giver and receiver, and may be increased or diminished at will. An _allowance_ may be given in any form, or at any stated times; a _stipend_ and _salary_ are paid yearly, or at even portions of a year; _wages, hire_, and _pay_ are estimated by days, weeks, or months, as well as years. An _allowance_ may be made by, with, and to persons of all ranks; a _stipend_ and _salary_ are assignable only to persons of respectability; _wages_ are given to laborers, _hire_ to servants, _pay_ to soldiers or such as are employed under government.

####allude 
**ALLUDE, REFER, HINT, SUGGEST.**  
_Allude, in_ Latin _alludo_, is compounded of _ad_ and _ludo_, sport. It means to say anything in a cursory manner. _Refer_, in Latin _refero_, signifies to bring back — that is, to bring back a person's recollection to any subject by mentioning it. _Hint_, a verb formed from the noun _hint_, which is a contraction of the participle of a verb _hinten, hinted_, is allied to the words _hit, hurt_, etc., and originally meant taken, touched. To _hint_ is to touch upon something. _Suggest_, in Latin _suggestus_, participle of _suggero_, is compounded of _sub_ and _gero_, bring under or near, and signifies to bring forward in an indirect or casual manner.  
To _allude_ is not so direct as to _refer_, but it is more clear and positive than either _hint_ or _suggest._ We _allude_ to a circumstance by introducing it into one's discourse; we _hint_ at a person's intentions by darkly insinuating what may possibly happen; we _suggest_ an idea by some poetical expressions relative to it. There are frequent _allusions_ in the Bible to the customs and manners of the East. It is necessary to _refer_ to certain passages of a work when we do not expressly copy them. It is sometimes better to be entirely silent upon a subject than to _hint_ at what cannot be fully explained. Many improvements have owed their origin to some ideas casually _suggested_ in the course of conversation.  
_Allude_ and _refer_ are always said with regard to things that have positively happened, and mostly such as are indifferent; _hint_ and _suggest_ have mostly a personal relation to things that are precarious. The whole drift of a discourse is sometimes unintelligible for want of knowing what is _alluded_ to; although many persons and incidents are _referred_ to with their proper names and dates. It is the part of the slanderer to _hint_ at things discreditable to I another when he does not dare to speak openly; and to _suggest_ doubts of his veracity when he cannot positively charge him with falsehood.

####allure 
**ALLURE, TEMPT, SEDUCE, ENTICE, DECOY.**  
_Allure_, from the Old French à _leurre_, a word of possibly Germanic origin, signifying bait, meant to draw to a bait. _Tempt_, in French _tenter_, Latin _lento_, a frequentative of the verb _tendere_, to stretch, meant to draw out one's will, hence to try the strength of, hence to test. _Seduce_, in French _séduire_, Latin _seduco_, is compounded of se, apart, and _duco_, lead, signifying to lead any one aside. _Entice_ comes from Old French _enticier_, based on _titio_, a firebrand. _Decoy_, from _de_ and Old French _coi_, earlier _coit_, from Latin _quietus_, quiet, still, meant to render still or tame. (Compare the adjective _coy.)_ But it is also influenced by provincial English _coy_, from Latin _cavea_ (whence English _cage)_, a trap for catching wild ducks.  
We are _allured_ by the appearances of things; we are _tempted_ by the words of persons as well as the appearances of things; we are _enticed_ by persuasions; we are _seduced_ or _decoyed_ by the influence and false arts of others. To _allure_ and _tempt_ are used either in a good or bad sense: _entice_ sometimes in an indifferent, but mostly in a bad sense; _seduce_ and _decoy_ are always in a bad sense. The weather may _allure_ us out-of-doors: the love of pleasures may _allure_ us into indulgences that afterward cause repentance. We are sometimes _tempted_ upon very fair grounds to undertake what turns out unfortunately in the end: our passions are our bitterest enemies; the devil uses them as instruments to _tempt_ us to sin. When the wicked _entice_ us to do evil, we should turn a deaf ear to their flattering representations: those who know what is right, and are determined to practise it, will not suffer themselves to be _enticed_ into any irregularities. Young men are frequently _seduced_ by the company they keep. Children are _decoyed_ away by the evil-minded, who wish to get them into their possession. The country has its _allurements_ for the contemplative mind; the metropolis is full of _temptations._ Those who have any evil project to execute will omit ho _enticement_ in order to _seduce_ the young and inexperienced from their duty. The practice of _decoying_ children or ignorant people into places of confinement was formerly more frequent than at present.  
_Allure_ does not imply such a powerful influence as _tempt;_ what _allures_ draws by gentle means; it lies in the nature of the thing that affects: what _tempts_ acts by direct and continued efforts; it presents motives to the mind in order to produce decision; it tries the power of resistance. _Entice_ supposes such a decisive influence on the mind as produces a determination to act; in which respect it differs from the two former terms. _Allure_ and _tempt_ produce actions on the mind, not necessarily followed by any result; for we may be _allured_ or _tempted_ to do a thing, without necessarily doing the thing; but we cannot be _enticed_ unless we are led to take some step. _Seduce_ and _decoy_ have reference to the outward action, as well as the inward movements of the mind which give rise to them; they indicate a drawing aside of the person as well as the mind; it is a misleading by false representation. Prospects are _alluring_, offers are _templing_, words are _enticing_, charms are _seductive._

####ally 
**ALLY, CONFEDERATE.**  
Although derived from the preceding terms (see [alliance](entry://alliance)), these are used only in part of their acceptations. An _ally_ is one who forms an _alliance_ in the political sense; a _confederate_ is one who forms _confederacies_ in general, but more particularly when such _confederacies_ are unauthorized. William Tell had some few particular friends who were his _confederates;_ but we should use the word with more propriety in its worst sense, for an associate in a rebellious faction, as in speaking of any bandit and his _confederates._

####alone 
**ALONE, SOLITARY, LONELY.**  
_Alone_, in Middle English often written as two words, _al one_, signifies altogether one, or single; that is, by one's self. _Solitory_, in French _solitaire_, Latin _solitarius_, from _solus_, alone, signifies the quality of being _alone. Lonely_ is a derivative of _lone_, which is a contraction of _all one. Alone_ marks the state of a person; _solitary_ the quality of a person or thing; _lonely_ has more melancholy connotations than _solitary_, and may be used to indicate the state of mind of one dwelling _alone._ A person walks _alone_, or takes a _solitary_ walk in a _lonely_ place. Whoever likes to be much _alone_ is of a _solitary_ turn; wherever we can be most and oftenest _alone_, that is a _solitary_ or _lonely_ place; people who are forced to dwell _alone_ may be often _lonely._

####also 
**ALSO, LIKEWISE, TOO.**  
_Also_, compounded of _all_ and _so_, signifies literally all in the same manner. _Likewise_, compounded of _like_ and _wise_, or manner, signifies in like manner. _Too_, a variation of the numeral _two_, signifies what may be added or joined to another thing from its similarity.  
These adverbial expressions obviously convey the same idea of including or classing certain objects together upon a supposed ground of affinity. _Also_ is a more general term, and has a more comprehensive meaning, as it implies a sameness in the whole; _likewise_ is more specific and limited in its acceptation; _too_ is still more limited than either, and refers only to a single object. "He _also_ was among the number, " may convey the idea of totality both as respects the person and the event; "he writes _likewise_ a very fine hand, conveys the idea of similar perfection in his writing as in other qualifications; "he said so, _too, "_ signifies he said so in addition to the others; "he said it _likewise, "_ would imply that he said the same thing or in the same manner.

####always 
**ALWAYS, AT ALL TIMES, EVER.**  
_Always_, compounded of _all_ and _ways_, is the same as, under all circumstances, through all the ways of life, that is, uninterruptedly. _At all times_ means without distinction of time. _Ever_ implies for a perpetuity, without end. A man must be _always_ virtuous, that is, whether in adversity or prosperity; and _at all tunes_ virtuous, that is, in his going out and coming in, his rising up and his lying down, by day and by night; he will then be _ever_ happy, that is, in this life and the life to come.

####ambassador 
**AMBASSADOR, ENVOY, PLENIPOTENTIARY, DEPUTY.**  
_Ambassador_ is derived through French from Low Latin _ambactus_, by way of Italian. _Ambactus_ is derived from an Old Gaulish (Celtic) root meaning servant, which also appears in the Anglo-Saxon _ombiht_, a servant. _Envoy_, Old French _envoyer_, to send, from Latin _inde_, and _via_, way, meant one sent on a mission. (Compare VOYAGE.) _Plenipotentiary_, from the Latin _plenus_ and _potens_, signifies one invested with full powers. _Deputy_ (for etymology see _depute_ under ASSIGN) meant one deputed, one assigned to a particular mission.  
_Ambassadors, envoys_, and _plenipotentiaries_ speak and act in the name of their sovereigns, with this difference, that the first is invested with the highest authority, acting in all cases as the representative; the second appears only as a simple authorized minister acting for another, but not always representing him: the third is a species of _envoy_ used by courts only on the occasion of concluding peace or making treaties: _deputies_ are not deputed by sovereigns, although they may be _deputed_ to sovereigns; they have no power to act or speak but in the name of some subordinate community or particular body. The functions of the first three belong to the minister, those of the latter to the agent.  
An _ambassador is_ a resident in a country during a state of peace; he must maintain the dignity of his court by a suitable degree of splendor: an _envoy_ may be a resident, but he is more commonly employed on particular occasions; address in negotiating forms is an essential in his character: a _plenipotentiary_ is not so much connected with the court immediately as with persons in the same capacity with himself; he requires to have integrity, coolness, penetration, loyalty, and patriotism. A _deputy_ has little or no responsibility, and still less intercourse with those to whom he is _deputed;_ he needs no more talent than is sufficient to maintain the respectability of his own character and that of the body to which he belongs. 

####ambiguous 
**AMBIGUOUS, EQUIVOCAL.**  
_Ambiguous_, in Latin _ambiguus_, from _ambigo_, compounded of _ambo_, both, and _agere_, to act, signifies acting both ways or having two meanings. _Equivocal_, in French _équivoque_, Latin _equivocus_, composed of _œquus_ and _vox_, signifies a word to be applied equally to two or more different objects.  
An _ambiguity_ arises from a too general form of expression, which leaves the sense of the author indeterminate; an _equivocation_ lies in the power of particular terms used, which admit of a double interpretation, or an application to two different things: the _ambiguity_ leaves us in entire incertitude as to what is meant; the _equivocation_ misleads us in the use of a term in the sense which we do not suspect.  
The _ambiguity_ may be unintentional, arising from the nature both of the words and the things; or it may be employed to withhold information respecting our views; the _equivocation_ is always intentional, and may be employed for purposes of fraud. The histories of heathen nations are full of confusion and _ambiguity;_ the heathen oracles are mostly veiled by some _equivocation;_ of this we have a remarkable instance in the oracle of the Persian mule, by which Croesus was misled. 

####amenable 
See **answerable** under [answer](entry://answer)

####amend 
**AMEND, CORRECT, EMEND, IMPROVE, MEND, BETTER.**  
_Amend_ and _emend_, in Latin _emendo_, from _menda_, the fault of a transcriber, signifies to remove faults generally. _Mend_, which is a contraction of _amend_, is similar in sense, but different in application. _Correct_, from _cum_ and _regere_, to regulate, signifies to set right in a particular manner. _Improve_, from _probus_, good, signifies to make good, as _better_ signifies to make _better._  
To _amend, emend, correct_, and _mend_ imply the removing of an evil; _improve_ and _better_, the increase of good.  
_Amend, emend_, and _correct_, are all applied to works of the understanding, with this distinction, that _amend_ signifies to remove faults or defects generally, either by adding, taking away, or altering, as to _amend_ a law, to _amend_ a passage in a book; this is the work of the author, or some one acting for him: to _emend_ is to remove particular faults in any literary work by the alteration of letters or single words; this is the work of the critic: to _correct_ is to remove gross faults, as to _correct_ the press.  
_Amend_ and _correct_ may be applied to moral objects with a similar distinction.  
_Mend_ is employed in respect to any works in the sense of putting that right which either is or has become faulty. It is a term in ordinary use, but may be employed in the higher style.  
To _improve_ is said either of persons or things which are made better; as to improve the mind, morals, etc.: to _better_ is mostly applied to the outward condition on familiar occasions. 

####amends 
See [compensation](entry://compensation); [restoration](entry://restoration)

####amiable 
**AMIABLE, LOVELY, BELOVED.**  
_Amiable_, in Latin _amabilis_, from _amare_ to love, signifies fit to be loved. _Lovely_, compounded of _love_ and _ly_, or _like_, signifies like that which we love, fit to produce love. _Beloved_ signifies having or receiving love.  
The two first express the fitness of an object to awaken the sentiment of love: the former by spiritual qualities, the latter by personal attractions. One is _amiable_ from the qualities of the heart.  
So also it is said of things personified. One has a _lovely_ person, or is _lovely_ in one's person. It may be applied to the attractions of other objects besides those of the person.  
_Beloved_ denotes the state of being loved, or being the object of love, which may arise from being _amiable_ or _lovely_, or from other causes. Both persons and things may be _beloved._

####amicable 
**AMICABLE, FRIENDLY.**  
_Amicable_, from _amicus_, a friend, signifies able or fit for a friend. _Friendly_ signifies _like a friend._ The word _amicus_ likewise comes from _amo_, to love, and _friend_ from Anglo-Saxon _freogan_, to love. _Amicable_ and _friendly_, therefore, both denote the tender sentiment of goodwill which all men ought to bear one to another; but _amicable_ rather implies a negative sentiment, a freedom from discordance; and _friendly_ a positive feeling of regard, the absence of indifference. We make an _amicable_ accommodation, and a _friendly_ visit. It is a happy thing when people who have been at variance can _amicably_ adjust all their disputes. Nothing adds more to the charms of society than a _friendly_ correspondence. _Amicable_ is always said of persons who have been in connection with each other; _friendly_ may be applied to those who are perfect strangers. Neighbors must always endeavor to live _amicably_ with each other. Travelers should always endeavor to keep up a _friendly_ intercourse with the inhabitants wherever they come.  
The abstract terms of the__ preceding qualities admit of no variation but in the signification of _friendship_, which marks an individual feeling only. To live _amicably_, or in _amity_ with all men, is a point of Christian duty, but we cannot live in _friendship_ with all men, since _friendship_ must be confined to a few: so nations may be in _amity_, though not on terms of _friendship_ with each other. 

####ammunition 
**AMMUNITION, MUNITIONS.**  
These words have been somewhat modified in application since the beginning of the European war. _Ammunition_ was originally merely an army corruption of _munition_, from Latin _munitio_ (from _munire_, to fortify with a wall). During the war, however, the word _munitions_, used in the plural, has been widely used to designate all the materials for shooting employed in warfare; _ammunition_ has merely kept its meaning of material with which to load a gun which it had before the war, and in popular speech has been largely supplanted by the more general word _munitions._

####amnesia 
**AMNESIA, BEWILDERMENT, FORGETFULNESS.**  
_Amnesia_ comes from the Greek _αμνησία_, and implies the loss of memory for words. The victim is apt to be an apparently aimless wanderer on the streets, and on being accosted appears to be in a high state of _bewilderment_, anxiety, perplexity.  
While the affliction is in an acute stage the victim is unable to recall his or her name, place of residence, occupation, or present intentions.  
Properly speaking, the word has no genuine synonym. _Bewilderment_ and _forgetfulness_ are general words which may be used to describe the state of mind of one afflicted by _amnesia._

####amorous 
**AMOROUS, LOVING, FOND.**  
_Amorous_, from _amor_, and the ending, _ous_, which designates abundance, signifies full of love. _Loving_ signifies the act of _loving_, that is, continually _loving. Fond_ (for derivation see under _affectionate)_ signifies an extreme or foolish attachment.  
These epithets are all used to mark the excess or distortion of a tender sentiment. _Amorous_ is taken in a criminal sense, _loving_ and _fond_ in a contemptuous sense; an indiscriminate and dishonorable attachment to the fair sex characterizes the _amorous_ man; an overweening and childish attachment to any object marks the _loving_ and _fond_ person. _Loving_ is less dishonorable than _fond:_ men may be _loving;_ children and brutes may be _fond._ Those who have not a well-regulated affection for each other will be _loving_ by fits and starts; children and animals who have no control over their appetites will be apt to be _fond_ of those who indulge them. An _amorous_ temper should be suppressed; a _loving_ temper should be regulated; a _fond_ temper should be checked.  
When taken generally, _loving_ and _fond_ may be used in a good or indifferent sense. 

####amortizement 
**AMORTIZEMENT, AMORTIZATION.**  
The term _amortizement_, in French _amortissement_, is derived from _amortize_, in French _amortir_, to extinguish, from Latin _mortis_, death, meaning in a general sense to make dead or render useless.  
While _amortization_ specifically means the right of alienating lands in mortmain, the term has of late come into vogue as synonymous with _amortizement_, especially in European countries burdened with debt.  
Thus we read that certain revenues, or parts thereof, of a country have been assigned to the _amortization_ or _amortizement_ of the national debt, meaning a _payment_ on account, or the _extinction_ (payment in full), _liquidation_ (partial or full payment), _reduction_ (partial payment), or _redemption_ (full payment) of outstanding obligations. 

####ample 
**AMPLE, SPACIOUS, CAPACIOUS.**  
_Ample_ is in French _ample_, Latin _amplus_, large, full. _Spacious_, in French _spacieux_, from Latin _spatium_, allied to Greek _σπάειν_, to draw out, English _span_ — all from a root _spa_, to spread or draw out. _Capacious_, in Latin _capax_, from _capio_, to hold, signifies the quality of being able to hold.  
These epithets convey the analogous ideas of extent in quantity and extent in space. _Ample_ is figuratively employed for whatever is extended in quantity; _spacious_ is literally used for whatever is extended in _space; capacious_ is literally and figuratively employed to express extension in both quantity and _space._ Stores are _ample_, room is _ample_, an allowance is _ample;_ a room, a house, or a garden is _spacious;_ a vessel or hollow of any kind is _capacious;_ the soul, the mind, and the heart are _capacious. Ample_ is opposed to scanty, _spacious_ to narrow, _capacious_ to small. What is _ample_ suffices and satisfies; it imposes no constraint: what is _spacious_ is free and open; it does not confine: what is _capacious_ readily receives and contains; it is liberal and generous. Although sciences, arts, philosophy, and languages afford to the mass of mankind _ample_ scope for the exercise of their mental powers without recurring to mysterious or fanciful researches, yet this world is hardly _spacious_ enough for the range of the intellectual faculties: the _capacious_ minds of some are no less capable of containing than they are disposed for receiving whatever spiritual good is offered them.

####amuse 
**AMUSE, DIVERT, ENTERTAIN.**  
To _amuse_, to cause to muse or wonder at, is derived from French _à_ and _muser_ (English verb _muse)_, Italian _musare_, to gape idly about, from _muso_, a snout, a face. "The image is that of a dog snuffling idly about, and _musing_ which way to take" (Skeat). Cf. _muzzle._ Divert, in French _divertir_, Latin _diverto_, is compounded of _dis_, apart, and _vertere_, to turn aside, signifying to turn the mind aside from an object. _Entertain_, in French _entretenir_, compounded of _entre_, Latin _inter_, and _tenir_, Latin _tenere_, to keep, signifies to keep the mind fixed on a thing.  
We _amuse_ or _entertain_ by engaging the attention on some present occupation, we _divert_ by drawing the attention from a present object; all this proceeds by means of that pleasure which the object produces, which in the first case is less vivid than in the second, and in the second case is less durable than in the third. Whatever _amuses_ serves to kill time, to lull the faculties and banish reflection; it may be solitary, sedentary, and lifeless; whatever _diverts_ causes mirth and provokes laughter; it will be active, lively, and tumultuous: whatever _entertains_ acts on the senses and awakens the understanding; it must be rational, and is mostly social. The bare act of walking and changing place may _amuse;_ the tricks of animals _divert;_ conversation _entertains._ We sit down to a card-table, to be _amused;_ we go to a comedy or pantomime to be _diverted;_ we go to a tragedy to be _entertained._ Children are _amused_ with looking at pictures; ignorant people are _diverted_ with shows; intelligent people are _entertained_ with reading. The dullest and most vacant minds may be _amused;_ the most volatile are _diverted;_ the most reflective are _entertained;_ the Emperor Domitian _amused_ himself with killing flies; the Emperor Nero _diverted_ himself with appearing before his subjects in the characters of the gladiator and charioteer; Socrates _entertained_ himself by discoursing on the day of his execution with his friends on the immortality of the soul.  
**AMUSE, BEGUILE.** — As _amuse_ denotes the occupation of the mind, so _beguile_, compounded of the English prefix _be_ and Old French _guile_ (English _wile)_, (for the derivation of which see that key-word), signifying to overreach with guile, expresses an effect or consequence of amusement. When _amuse_ and _beguile_ express any species of deception, the former indicates what is effected by persons, and the latter that which is effected by things. The first is a fraud upon the understanding; the second is a fraud upon the memory and consciousness. We are _amused_ by a false story; our misfortunes are _beguiled by_ the charms of fine music or fine scenery. To suffer one's self to be _amused_ is an act of weakness; to be _beguiled_ is a relief and a privilege. Credulous people are easily _amused by_ any idle tale, and thus prevented from penetrating the designs of the artful; weary travelers _beguile_ the tedium of the journey by lively conversation.  
**AMUSEMENT, ENTERTAINMENT, DIVERSION, SPORT, RECREATION, PASTIME.** — _Amusement_ signifies here that which serves to _amuse. Entertainment_, that which serves to _entertain. Diversion_, that which serves to _divert. Sport_, that which serves to give _sport. Recreation_, that which serves to _recreate_, from _recreatus_, participle of _recreo_, or _re_ and _creo_, means to create or make alive again, and was originally used of a recovery from illness. _Pastime_ is that which serves to _pass time._  
The first four of these terms are either applied to objects which specifically serve the purposes of pleasure, or to such objects as may accidentally serve these purposes; the last two terms are employed only in the latter sense. The distinction between the first three terms is very similar in this as in the preceding case. _Amusement_ is a general term, which comprehends little more than the common idea of pleasure, whether small or great; _entertainment_ is a species of _amusement_ which is always more or less of an intellectual nature; _diversions_ and _sports_ are a species of _amusements_ more adapted to the young and the active, particularly the latter: the theatre or the concert is an _amusement;_ fairs and public exhibitions are _diversions;_ games of racing or cricket, hunting, shooting, and the like, are _sports. Recreation_ and _pastime_ are terms of relative import: the former is of use for those who labor; the latter for those who are idle. A _recreation_ must partake more or less of the nature of an _amusement_, but it is an occupation which owes its pleasure to the relaxation of the mind from severe exertion: in this manner gardening may be a _recreation_ to one who studies; company is _recreation_ to a man of business: the _pastime_ is the _amusement_ of the leisure hour; it may be alternately a _diversion_, a _sport_, or a simple _amusement_, as circumstances require.

####anecdote 
**ANECDOTE, STORY.**  
An _anecdote_ has but little incident and no plot; a _story_ (which, like Latin _historia_, English _history_, is derived from Greek _ιστορία_, which originally referred to something learned by inquiry, being a derivative from a verb signifying to know) may have many incidents and an important catastrophe annexed to it: _anecdotes_ are related of individuals, some of which are of a trifling nature, and others characteristic; _stories_ are generally told to young people of ghosts and visions, which are calculated to act on their fears. An _anecdote_ is pleasing and pretty; a _story_ is frightful or melancholy; an _anecdote_ always consists of some matter of fact; a _story_ is sometimes founded on that which is real. _Anecdotes_ are related of some distinguished persons, displaying: their characters or the circumstances of their fives: _stories_ from life, however striking and wonderful, will seldom impress so powerfully as those which are drawn from the world of spirits: _anecdotes_ serve to amuse men, stories to amuse children.  
**ANECDOTES, MEMOIRS, CHRONICLES, ANNALS.** — _Anecdote_, Greek _ανέκδοτος_, meant literally unpublished, not given out, from _έκ_ _(ex)_ and _δίδωμι_, give. _Memoirs_, in French _mémoires_, from the word _memory_, signifies what serves to help the memory. _Chronicle_, in French _chronique_, from the Greek _χρόνος_, time, signifies an account of the times. _Annals_, from the French _annales_, from the Latin _annus_, signifies a detail of what passes in the year.  
All these terms mark a species of narrative, more or less connected, that may serve as materials for a regular history. _Anecdotes_ consist of personal or detached circumstances of a public or private nature, involving one subject or more. _Anecdotes_ may be either-moral or political, literary or biographical; they may serve as characteristics of any individual, or of any particular nation or age. _Memoirs_ may include _anecdotes_, as far as they are connected with the leading subject on which they treat: _memoirs_ are rather connected than complete; they are a partial narrative respecting an individual, comprehending matter of a public or private nature; they serve as _memorials_ of what ought not to be forgotten, and lay the foundation either for a history or a life.  
_Chronicles_ and _annals_ are altogether of a public nature; and approach the nearest to regular and genuine history. _Chronicles_ register the events as they pass; _annals_ digest them into order, as they occur in the course of successive years. _Chronicles_ are minute as to the exact point of time; _annals_ only preserve a general order within the period of a year. _Chronicles_ detail the events of small as well as large communities, as of particular districts and cities; _annals_ detail only the events of nations. _Chronicles_ include domestic incidents, or such things as concern individuals; the word _annals_, in its proper sense, relates only to such things as affect the great body of the public, but it is frequently employed in an improper sense. _Chronicles_ may be confined to simple matter of fact; _annals_ may enter into the causes and consequences of events. 

####anger 
**ANGER, RESENTMENT, WRATH, IRE, INDIGNATION.**  
_Anger_ comes from the Latin _angere_, Greek _άγχειν_, to strangle, Icelandic _angr_, grief, sorrow, Danish _anger_, compunction, etc., from which our words _anxious, anxiety_, etc., are also derived, and refers to the physical sensations accompanying anger or grief. _Resentment_, in French _ressentiment_, from _resentir_, is compounded of _re_ and _sentir_, signifying to feel again, over and over, or for a continuance. _Wrath_, Anglo-Saxon _wrath_, English _wroth, angry_, and _ire_, Latin _ira_, are less obviously metaphorical than the preceding; the original roots in both cases having, apparently, the meaning of the present words. _Indignation_, in French _indignation_, in Latin _indignatio_, from _indignor_, to think or feel unworthy, marks the strong feeling which base conduct or unworthy treatment awakens in the mind.  
An impatient agitation against any one who acts contrary to our inclinations or opinions is the characteristic of all these terms. _Resentment_ is less vivid than _anger_, and _anger_ than _wrath, ire_, or _indignation. Anger_ is a sudden sentiment of displeasure; _resentment_ is a continued _anger; wrath_ is a heightened sentiment of _anger_, which is poetically expressed by the word _ire. Anger_ may be either a selfish or a disinterested passion, it may be provoked by injuries done to ourselves, or injustice done to others: in this latter sense of strong displeasure God is _angry_ with sinners, and good men may to a certain degree be _angry_ with those under their control who act improperly. _Resentment_ is a brooding sentiment altogether arising from a sense of personal injury; it is associated with a dislike of the offender, as much as the offence, and is diminished only by the infliction of pain in return; in its rise, progress, and effects, it is alike opposed to the Christian spirit. _Wrath_ and _ire_ are the sentiment of a superior toward an inferior, and when provoked by personal injuries discovers itself by haughtiness and a vindictive temper: as a sentiment of displeasure, _wrath_ is unjustifiable between man and man; but the _wrath_ of God may be provoked by the persevering impenitence of sinners; the _ire_ of a heathen god, according to the gross views of pagans, was but the _wrath_ of man associated with greater power: it was altogether unconnected with moral displeasure. _Indignation_ is a sentiment awakened by the unworthy and atrocious conduct of others; as it is exempt from personality, it is not irreconcilable with the temper of a Christian: a warmth of constitution sometimes gives rise to sallies of _anger;_ but depravity of heart breeds _resentment:_ unbending pride is a great source of _wrath;_ but _indignation_ may flow from a high sense of honor and virtue.

**ANGER, CHOLER, RAGE, FURY.** — _Anger_ (see above). _Choler_, in French _colère_, Latin _cholera_, Greek _χολέρα_, comes from _χολή_, bile, of which the English word _gall_ is a cognate, because the overflowing of _bile_ was supposed to be the physical accompaniment of anger. _Rage_, in French _rage_, from Latin _rabies_, madness, and _rabio_, to rave like a madman, signifies madness, hence the loss of self-control in extreme anger. Compare the use of _mad_ for angry among children. _Fury_, derived through French from Latin _furia_, is from a root signifying to rage, which refers especially to violent physical expression of anger, because one is carried or hurried away by the emotion of _fury._  
These words have a progressive force in their significance. _Choler_ expresses something more sudden and virulent than _anger; rage_ is a vehement ebullition of _anger;_ and _fury is_ an excess of _rage. Anger_ may be so stifled as not to discover itself- by any outward symptoms; _choler_ is discoverable by the paleness of the visage; _rage_ breaks forth into extravagant expressions and violent distortions; _fury_ takes away the use of the understanding. _Anger_ is an infirmity incident to human nature; it ought, however, to be suppressed on all occasions: _choler_ is a malady too physical to be always corrected by reflection: _rage_ and _fury_ are distempers of the soul, which nothing but religion and the grace of God can cure.

####angry 
**ANGRY, PASSIONATE, HASTY.**  
_Angry_ signifies either having _anger_, or prone to _anger. Passionate_ signifies prone to _passion. Hasty_ signifies prone to excess of _haste_ from intemperate feeling.  
_Angry_ denotes either a particular state or a habit of the mind; _passionate_ expresses a habit of the mind; _hastiness_ is mostly a temporary feeling. An _angry_ man is in a state of _anger;_ a _passionate_ man is habitually prone to be _passionate._ The _angry_ has less that is vehement and impetuous in it than the _passionate;_ the _hasty_ has something less vehement, but more sudden and abrupt in it than either. The _angry_ man is not always easily provoked, nor ready to retaliate; but he often retains his _anger_ until the cause is removed: the _passionate_ man is quickly roused, eager to repay the offence, and speedily appeased by the infliction of pain of which he afterward probably repents: the _hasty_ man is very soon offended, but not ready to offend in return; his _angry_ sentiment spends itself in _angry_ words.

####animadversion 
**ANIMADVERSION, CRITICISM, STRICTURE.**  
_Animadversion_, in Latin _animadversio_, from _animadvertere_, that is _vertere animum ad_, signifies to turn the mind, to a thing. _Criticism_, in French _critique_, Latin _criticus_, Greek _κριτικός_, from _κρίνειν_, to separate, hence to judge, signifies especially judgment founded on analysis. _Stricture_, Latin _strictura_, comes from the verb _stringere_, to draw tight, to urge, and signifies in Latin the exertion of pressure, oppression, etc. (Compare _strict, stringent.)  
Animadversion_ includes censure and reproof; _criticism_ implies scrutiny and judgment, whether for or against; and _stricture_ comprehends a partial investigation mingled with censure. We _animadvert_ on a person's opinions by contradicting or correcting them; we _criticise_ a person's works by minutely and rationally exposing their imperfections and beauties; we pass _strictures_ on public measures by descanting on them cursorily and censuring them partially. _Animadversions_ are too personal to be impartial, consequently they are seldom just; they are mostly resorted to by those who want to build up one system on the ruins of another: _criticism_ is one of the most important and honorable departments of literature; a _critic_ ought justly to weigh the merits and demerits of authors, but of the two his office is rather to blame than to praise; much less injury will accrue to the cause of literature from the severity than from the laxity of _criticism; strictures_ are mostly the vehicles of party spleen; like most ephemeral productions, they are too superficial to be entitled to serious notice.

####animal 
**ANIMAL, BRUTE, BEAST.**  
_Animal_, Latin _animal_, from _anima_, life, which is derived from a root signifying to breathe, indicates a living thing — _i.e._, one that breathes. _Brute_, Latin _brutus_, heavy, dull, was originally used as an adjective with beast, "a brute beast, " and hence developed into a substantive. _Beast_, French _bête_, from Latin _bestia_, signified the lower animals, as distinguished from man.  
_Animal_ is the generic, _brute_ and _beast_ are the specific terms. The _animal_ is the thing that lives and moves. If _animal_ be considered as thinking, willing, reflecting, and acting, it is confined in its signification to the human species; if it be regarded as limited in all the functions which mark intelligence and will, if it be divested of speech and reason, it belongs to the _brute;_ if _animal_ be considered, moreover, as to its appetites, independent of reason, of its destination, and consequent dependence on its mental powers, it descends to the _beast. Man_ and _brute_ are opposed. To man an immortal soul is assigned; but we are not authorized by Scripture to extend this dignity to the _brutes._ "The _brutes_ that perish" is the ordinary mode of distinguishing that part of the _animal_ creation from the superior order of terrestrial beings who are destined to exist in a future world. _Animal_, when applied to man individually, is a term of reproach; the epithets _brute_ and _beast_ are still stronger terms of reproach, the perversion of the rational faculty being at all times more shocking and disgraceful than the absence of it by nature. 

####animate 
**ANIMATE, INSPIRE, ENLIVEN, CHEER, EXHILARATE.**  
_Animate_, in Latin _animatus_, from _animus_, the mind, and _anima_, the soul or vital principle, signifies in the proper sense to give life, and in the moral sense to give spirit. The connection between the idea of breathing and that of life found in _animate_ (see derivation of _animal_ above) is more obvious in the word _inspire_, from _in_ and _spirare_, breathe into. _Enliven_ means literally to put life into. _Cheer_, Old French _chere_, is derived from Low Latin _cara_, a face, Greek κάρα, the head (compare _cerebrum_, the brain, _cerebral_, etc.) The original meaning is seen in the phrase "be of good _cheer, "_ literally put "a good _face_ on the matter. " It began to signify especially a glad face, and thence developed the verb to gladden, cheer. _Exhilarate_, in Latin _exhilaratus_, participle of _exhilaro_, from _hilaris_, Greek _ίλαρός_, joyful, signifies to make glad.  
_Animate_ and _inspire_ imply the communication of the vital or mental spark; _enliven, cheer_, and _exhilarate_ signify actions on the mind or body. To be _animated_ in its physical sense is simply to receive the first spark of animal life in however small a degree; for there are _animated_ beings in the world possessing the vital power in an infinite variety of degrees and forms: to be _animated_ in the moral sense is to receive the smallest portion of the sentient or thinking faculty, which is equally varied in thinking beings; the term _animation_, therefore, taken absolutely, never conveys the idea of receiving any strong degree of either physical or moral feeling. To _inspire_, on the contrary, expresses the communication of a strong moral sentiment or passion; hence, to _animate_ with courage is a less forcible expression than to _inspire_ with courage: we likewise speak of _inspiring_ with emulation or a thirst for knowledge; not of _animating_ with emulation or a thirst for knowledge. To _enliven_ respects the mind; _cheer_ relates to the heart; _exhilarate_ regards the spirits, both animal and mental; they all denote an action on the frame by the communication of pleasurable emotions: the mind is _enlivened_ by contemplating the scenes of nature; the imagination is _enlivened_ by reading poetry; the benevolent heart is _cheered_ by witnessing the happiness of others; the spirits are _exhilarated_ by the convivialities of social life: conversation _enlivens_ society; the conversation of a kind and considerate friend _cheers_ the drooping spirits in the moments of trouble; unexpected good news is apt to _exhilarate_ the spirits.

**ANIMATION, LIFE, VIVACITY, SPIRIT.** — _Animation_ and _life_ do not differ either in sense or application, but the latter is more in familiar use. They express either the particular or general state of the mind. _Vivacity_ and _spirit_ express only the habitual nature and state of the feelings.  
A person of no _animation_ is divested of the distinguishing characteristic of his nature, which is mind; a person of no _vivacity_ is a dull companion; a person of no _spirit_ is unfit to associate with others. A person with _animation_ takes an interest in everything: a _vivacious_ man catches at everything that is pleasant and interesting: a _spirited_ man enters into plans, makes great exertions, and disregards difficulties. A speaker may address his audience with more or less _animation_, according to the disposition in winch he finds it: a man of a _vivacious_ temper diffuses his _vivacity_ into all his words and actions: a man of _spirit_ suits his measures to the exigency of his circumstances.

####announce 
**ANNOUNCE, PROCLAIM, PUBLISH.**  
_Announce_, in Latin _annuncio_, is compounded of _an_ or _ad_ and _nuncio_, to tell to any one in a particular manner. _Proclaim_, in Latin _proclamo_, is compounded of _pro_ and _clamo_, to cry before, or cry aloud. _Publish_, in Latin _publico_, from _publiais_ and _populus_, signifies to make _public_ or known to the people at large.  
The characteristic sense of these words is the malting of a thing known to numbers of individuals: a thing is _announced_ in a formal manner to many or few; it is _proclaimed_ to a neighborhood, and _published_ to the world. We _announce_ an event that is expected and just at hand; we _proclaim_ an event that requires to be known by all the parties interested; we _publish_ what is supposed likely to interest all who know it. _Announcements_ are made verbally, or by some well-known signal; _proclamations_ are made verbally and accompanied by some appointed signal; _publications_ are ordinarily made through the press, or by oral communication from one individual to another. The arrival of a distinguished person is _announced_ by the ringing of the bells; the _proclamation_ of peace by a herald is accompanied with certain ceremonies calculated to excite notice; the _publication_ of news is the office of the journalist.

####answer 
**ANSWER, REPLY, REJOINDER, RESPONSE.**  
_Answer_, Anglo-Saxon _andswarian_, compounded of _and_ (corresponding to Latin _ante_, Greek _άντι)_ and _swerian_, to swear, means to swear in response to something, to take one's oath concerning the other side of the question. _Reply_ comes from the French _répliquer_, Latin _replico_, unfold, signifying to unfold or enlarge upon by way of explanation. _Rejoin_ is compounded of _re_ and _jungere_, to join, signifying to join or add in return. _Response_, in Latin _responsus_, participle of _respondeo_, compounded of _re_ and _spondeo_, promise (compare _sponsor)_, signifies to promise in return, to give sanction to in return.  
Under all these terms is included the idea of using words in return for other words, or returning a sound for a sound. An _answer_ is given to a question; a _reply_ is made to an assertion; a _rejoinder_ is made to a _reply;_ a _response_ is made in accordance with the words of another. We _answer_ either for the purpose of affirmation, information, or contradiction; we always _reply_ or _rejoin_, in order to explain or confute; _responses_ are made by way of assent or confirmation. It is impolite not to _answer_ when we are addressed; arguments are maintained by the alternate _replies_ and _rejoinders_ of two parties; but such arguments seldom tend to the pleasure and improvement of society: the _responses_ in the Liturgy are peculiarly calculated to keep alive the attention of those who take part in the devotion.  
An _answer_ may be either spoken or written, or delivered in any manner; _reply_ and _rejoinder_ are used in personal discourse only; a _response_ may be said or sung, or delivered in a formal manner.  
Animals as well as men may give _answers_ or make _responses_, though not _replies_ or _rejoinders._  
**ANSWERABLE, RESPONSIBLE, ACCOUNTABLE, AMENABLE.** — _Answerable_, from _answer_, signifies ready or able to _answer_ for. _Responsible_, from _respondeo_, to _answer_, has a similar meaning in its original sense. _Accountable_, from _account_, signifies able or ready to give an _account. Amenable_, from the French _amener_, to lead, signifies liable to be led or bound.  
Between _answerable_ and _responsible_ there is a close alliance in the sense, but some difference in the application. A person is _answerable_ generally in respect to what he undertakes to pay or take charge of; he is _answerable_ for his own debts, or for the debts of others to which he has made himself liable; he may also be _answerable_ for things left in his charge: _responsible_ is applied to higher matters of trust or duty; as an officer is _responsible_ for the conduct of the men who are under him; so to hold a responsible position under government; and in an extended sense to be morally _responsible_ — that is, _responsible_ to society as a moral agent.  
_Answerable_ and _responsible_ convey the idea of a pledge given for the performance of some act, or the fulfilment of some engagement, a breach of which subjects the defaulter to loss, punishment, or disgrace: _accountable_ implies simply giving an account or explanation of one's proceedings. The two former have respect to the obligations only: the _accountability_ results from the relation of the parties; a person is _accountable_ to his employer for the manner in which he has conducted any business intrusted to him; a child is _accountable_ to his parents for all his actions while he is under their control; and we are all _accountable_ to the Great Judge of all. To be _amenable_ is to be _accountable_ as far as laws and regulations bind a person; one is _amenable_ to the laws of society, or he is _amenable_ to the rules of the house in which he is only an inmate.

####antecedent 
**ANTECEDENT, PRECEDING, FOREGOING, PREVIOUS, ANTERIOR, PRIOR, FORMER.**  
_Antecedent_, in Latin _antecedens_ — that is, _ante_ and _cedens_, going before. _Preceding_, in Latin _precedens_, going before. _Foregoing_, literally going before. _Previous_ is in Latin _prœvius_, that is, _prœ_ and _via_, in the way before. _Anterior_, the comparative of the Latin in _ante_, before. _Prior_, in Latin _prior_, comparative of _primus_, first. _Former_, in English the comparative of first.  
_Antecedent, preceding, foregoing, previous_ are employed for what goes or happens before: _anterior, prior, former_, for what is or exists before. _Antecedent_ marks priority of order, place, and position, with this peculiar circumstance, that it denotes the relation of influence, dependence, and connection established between two objects: thus, in logic the premises are called the _antecedent_, and the conclusion the consequent; in theology or politics, the _antecedent_ is any decree or resolution which influences another decree or action; in mathematics it is that term from winch any induction can be drawn to another; in grammar, the _antecedent_ is that which requires a particular regimen from its subsequent. _Antecedent_ and _preceding_ both denote _priority_ of time, or the order of events; but the former, in a more vague and indeterminate manner than the latter. A _preceding_ event is that which happens immediately before the one of which we are speaking; whereas _antecedent_ may have events of circumstances intervening. An _antecedent_ proposition may be separated from its consequent by other propositions; but a _preceding_ proposition is closely followed by another. In this sense _antecedent_ is opposed to _posterior; preceding_ to _succeeding. Preceding_ respects simply the succession of tir es and things; but _previous_ denotes the succession of actions and events, with the collateral idea of their connection with an influence upon each other: we speak of the _preceding_ day, or the _preceding_ chapter, merely as the day or chapter that goes before; but when we speak of a _previous_ engagement or a _previous_ inquiry, it supposes an engagement preparatory to something that is to follow: _previous_ is opposed to subsequent: _foregoing_ is employed to mark the order of things narrated or stated; as when we speak of the _foregoing_ statement, the _foregoing_ objections, or the _foregoing_ calculation, etc.: _foregoing_ is opposed to following.  
_Anterior, prior_, and _former_ have all a relative sense, and are used for things that are more before than others: _anterior_ is a technical term to denote forwardness in place or time, but more commonly the former, as in anatomy; the _anterior_ or fore part of the skull, in contradistinction to the posterior part; so likewise the _anterior_ or fore front of a building, in opposition to the back front: _prior is_ used in the sense of _previous_ when speaking comparatively of two or more things when it implies anticipation; a _prior_ claim invalidates the one that is set up; a _prior_ engagement prevents the forming of any other that is proposed: _former_ is employed either with regard to times, as _former_ times, in contradistinction to dater periods, or with regard to propositions, when the _former_ or first thing mentioned is opposed to the latter or last mentioned. 

####anthrax 
**ANTHRAX, MALIGNANT PUSTULE, SPLENIC FEVER, CARBUNCLE.**  
_Anthrax_, Greek _άνθραξ_, a carbuncle or coal (compare _anthracite)_, is the name for a disease attacking animals, and characterized by the appearance of _malignant boils_, or _carbuncles._ The various synonymes refer to the characteristics of the disease, but do not differ in application. _Splenic fever_ refers to the enlargement of the spleen, caused by the disease. _Malignant pustule_ refers especially to the inflammation and breaking of the boils. _Carbuncle_ in itself does not indicate the disease as it is now known; it is the early name applied to boils in the skin.  
The disease was long believed to affect the lower animals only, but late in 1915 several persons in the United States were attacked by it, some with fatal results. The Department of Agriculture placed at the disposal of the attending physicians a remedy it had been using with marked success among cattle, and in one case this proved effective, while in others the application was too late.

####apologize 
**APOLOGIZE, DEFEND, JUSTIFY, EXCULPATE, EXCUSE, PLEAD.**  
_Apologize_, from the Greek _απολογία_, and _υπολογίζομαι_, compounded of _από_, from or__ away, and _λέγω_, speak, signifies to do away by speaking. _Defend_, in French _défendre_, is compounded of _de_ and _fendo_, signifying to keep or ward off. _Justify_, in French _justifier_, Latin _justifico_, is compounded of _justus_ and _facto_, signifying to do justice, or to put right. _Exculpate_, in Latin _exculpatus_, participle of _exculpo_, compounded of _ex_ and _culpa_, signifies to get out of a fault. _Excuse_, in French _excuser_, Latin _excuse_, compounded of _ex_ and _causa_, signifies to get out of any charge, _causa_ being a legal term, found in the phrases "to plead one's _cause, "_ "make out a _case, "_ etc. _Plead_, in French _plaider_, is derived from _placere_, to please, like the words _plea, please, placate_, etc.  
There is always some imperfection supposed or real which gives rise to an _apology;_ with regard to persons it presupposes a consciousness of impropriety, if not of guilt; we _apologize_ for an error by acknowledging ourselves guilty of it: a _defence_ presupposes a consciousness of innocence more or less; we _defend_ ourselves against a charge by proving its fallacy: a _justification_ is founded on the conviction not only of entire innocence, but of strict propriety; we _justify_ our conduct against any imputation by proving that it was blameless; _exculpation_ rests on the conviction of innocence with regard to the fact: we _exculpate_ ourselves from all blame by proving that we took no part in the transaction: _excuse_ and _plea_ are not grounded on any idea of innocence; they are rather appeals for favor resting on some collateral circumstance which serves to extenuate; a _plea_ is frequently an idle or unfounded _excuse_, a frivolous attempt to lessen displeasure: we _excuse_ ourselves for a neglect by alleging indisposition; we _plead_ for forgiveness by solicitation and entreaty.  
An _apology_ mostly respects the conduct of individuals with regard to each other as equals; it is a voluntary act, springing out of a regard to decorum or the good opinion of others. To avoid misunderstandings it is necessary to _apologize_ for any omission that wears the appearance of neglect. A _defence_ respects matters of higher importance: the violations of laws or public morals: judicial questions decided in a court or matters of opinion which are offered to the decision of the public; no one _defends_ himself but he whose conduct or opinions are called in question. A _justification_ is applicable to all moral cases in common life, whether of a serious nature or otherwise: it is the act of individuals toward each other according to their different stations: no one can demand a _justification_ from another without a sufficient authority, and no one will attempt to _justify_ himself to another whose authority he does not acknowledge: men _justify_ themselves either on principles of honor or from the less creditable motive of concealing their imperfections from the observation and censure of others. An _exculpation_ is the act of an inferior; it respects the violations of duty toward the superior: it is dictated by necessity, and seldom the offspring of any higher motive than the desire to screen one's self from punishment: _exculpation_ regards offences only of commission; _excuse_ is employed for those of omission as well as commission: we _excuse_ ourselves oftener for what we have not done than for what we have done: it is the act of persons in all stations, and arises from various motives, dishonorable or otherwise: a person may often have substantial reasons to _excuse_ himself from doing a thing or for not having done it; an _excuse_ may likewise sometimes be the refuge of idleness and selfishness. To _plead_ is properly a judicial act, and extended in its sense to the ordinary concerns of life; it is mostly employed for the benefit of others rather than ourselves.  
_Excuse_ and _plea_, which are mostly employed in an unfavorable sense, are to _apology, defence_, and _exculpation_ as the means to an end: an _apology_ is lame when, instead of an honest confession of an unintentional error, an idle attempt is made at _justification;_ a _defence_ is poor when it does not contain sufficient to invalidate the charge; a _justification_ is nugatory when it applies to conduct altogether wrong; an _excuse_ or a _plea_ is frivolous or idle which turns upon some falsehood, misrepresentation, or irrelevant point.

####apparel 
**APPAREL, ATTIRE, ARRAY.**  
_Apparel_ comes from Old French _apareiller_, from Latin _ad_, to, and Medieval Latin _pariculus_, from _par_, equal, meaning to put together things that are alike, to arrange, hence to arrange the dress. _Attire_ comes from Old French _atirier_, from _ad_, to, and Old French _tire_ or _tiere_, a row (compare our word _tier)_, possibly of Teutonic origin; it means to place in rows, hence to arrange. _Array_ comes from Latin _ad_ and Teutonic _rede_, ready; and meant at first to get ready.  
These terms are all applicable to dress or exterior decoration. _Apparel_ is the dress of every one; _attire_ is the dress of the great; _array_ is the dress of particular persons on particular occasions: it is the first object of every man to provide himself with _apparel_ suitable to his station; but the desire of shining forth in gaudy _attire_ is the property of little minds: in festivals and solemn occasions it may be proper for those who are to be conspicuous to set themselves out with a comely _array. Apparel_ and _attire_ respect the quality and fashion of the tiling; but _array_ has regard to the disposition of the things with their neatness and decorum: _apparel_ may be costly or mean; _attire_ may be gay or shabby; but _array_ will never be otherwise than neat or comely. 

####apparent 
**APPARENT, VISIBLE, CLEAR, PLAIN, OBVIOUS, EVIDENT, MANIFEST.**  
_Apparent_, in Latin _apparens_, participle of _appareo_, to appear, signifies the quality of appearing. _Visible_, in Latin _visibilis_, from _visus_, participle of _video_, to see, signifies capable of being seen. _Clear_ is in French _clair_, German, Swedish, etc., _klar_, Latin _clarus. Plain_, in Latin _planus_, even, signifies what is so smooth and unencumbered that it can be seen. _Obvious_ in Latin _obvius_, compounded of _ob_ and _via_, signifies the quality of lying in one's way or before one's eyes. _Evident_, in French _evident_, Latin _evidens_, means something clearly seen or known, from _e_ or _ex, out_, and _video_, see. The intensive force of _e_ in this case is similar to that of the prepositions or adverb in English phrases like "see one's way out" of difficulty, "to see through" something, etc. _Manifest_, in French _manifeste_, Latin _manifestus_, compounded of _manus_, the hand, and _festus_, possibly from _fendo_, to strike, signifies the quality of being so near that it can be laid hold of by the hand.  
These words agree in expressing various degrees in the capability of seeing; but _visible_ is the only one used purely in a physical sense; _apparent, clear, plain_, and _obvious_ are used physically and morally; _evident_ and _manifest_ solely in a moral acceptation. That which is simply an object of sight is _visible;_ that which presents itself to our view in any form, real or otherwise, is _apparent;_ the stars themselves are _visible_ to us; but their size is _apparent. Visible_ is applied to that which merely admits of being seen; _apparent_ and the other terms denote not only what is to be seen, but what is easily to be seen: they are all applied as epithets to objects of mental discernment; what is _apparent_ strikes the view; what is _clear_ is to be seen in all its parts and in its proper colors: it is opposed to that which is obscure; what is _plain is_ seen by a plain understanding: it requires no deep reflection or severe study; it is opposed to what is intricate: what is _obvious_ presents itself readily to the mind of every one; it is seen at the first glance, and is opposed to that which is abstruse: what is _evident_ is seen forcibly, and leaves no hesitation on the mind; it is opposed to that which is dubious; _manifest_ is a greater degree of the _evident;_ it strikes on the understanding and forces conviction; it is opposed to that which is dark. A thing is _apparent_ upon the face of it: a case is _clear;_ it is decided on immediately: a truth is _plain;_ it is involved in no perplexity; it is not multifarious in its bearings: a falsehood is _plain;_ it admits of no question: a reason is _obvious;_ it flows out of the nature of the case: a proof is _evident; it_ requires no discussion, there is nothing in it that clashes or contradicts; the guilt or innocence of a person is _evident_ when everything serves to strengthen the conclusion: a contradiction or absurdity is _manifest_ which is felt by all as soon as it is perceived.

_Appearance_ signifies the thing that appears or the manner of appearing. _Air_ (see [air](entry://air)). _Aspect_, in Latin _aspectus_, from _aspicio_, from _ad_ (to) and _specere_, look, cognate with English _spy_, signifies the thing that is looked upon or seen.  
_Appearance_ is the generic, the rest are specific terms. The whole external form, figure, or colors, whatever is visible to the eye, is its _appearance; air_ is a particular _appearance_ of any object as far as it is indicative of its quality or condition; an _air_ of wretchedness or poverty: _aspect_ is the partial _appearance_ of a body as it presents one of its sides to view; a gloomy or cheerful _aspect._ It is not safe to judge of either persons or things altogether by _appearances;_ the _appearance_ and reality are often at variance: the _appearance_ of the sun is that of a moving body, but astronomers assert that it has no motion round the earth: there are particular towns, habitations, or rooms which have always an _air_ of comfort, or the contrary: this is a sort of _appearance_ the most to be relied on: politicians of a certain stamp are always busy in judging for the future from the _aspect_ of affairs; but their predictions, like those of astrologers who judge from the _aspect_ of the heavens, frequently turn out to the discredit of the prophet.

####appease 
**APPEASE, CALM, PACIFY, QUIET, STILL.**  
For derivation of _appease_ see [allay](entry://allay). _Calm_ comes from Late Latin _cauma_, the heat of the sun, Greek _καύμα_, modified by Latin _calere_, to grow hot, and signified rest during the day. _Pacify_, in Latin _pacifico_, compounded of _pax_ and _facio_, signifies to make peaceable. _Quiet_, in French _quiet_, Latin _quietus_, from _quies_, rest, signifies to put to rest. _Still_, from Anglo-Saxon _stillan_, to remain in a _stall_, is allied with the German _slellen_, to place, and signifies to stop all movement, to place at rest.  
To _appease_ is to remove great agitation; to _calm_ is to bring into a tranquil state. The wind is _appeased_, the sea is calmed. With regard to persons, it is necessary to _appease_ those who are in transports of passion, and to _calm_ those who are in trouble, anxiety, or apprehension. _Appease_ respects matters of force or violence, _calm_ those of inquietude and distress: one is _appeased_ by a submissive behavior, and _calmed_ by the removal of danger. _Pacify_ corresponds to _appease_, and _quiet_ to _calm;_ in sense they are the. same, but in application they differ; _appease_ and _calm_ are used only in reference to objects of importance; _pacify_ and _quiet_ to those of a more familiar nature: the uneasy humors of a child are _pacified_ or its groundless fears are _quieted. Still_ is a loftier expression than any of the former terms; serving mostly for the grave or poetic style: it is an onoma-topœia for restraining or putting to silence that which is noisy and boisterous.

####applause 
**APPLAUSE, ACCLAMATION.**  
_Applause_, from the Latin _applaudo_, signifies, literally, to clap or stamp the feet to a tiling. _Acclamation_, from _acclamo_, signifies a crying out to a thing.  
These terms express a public demonstration; the former by means of a noise with the hands or feet; the latter by means of shouts and cries: the former being employed as a testimony of approbation; the latter as a sanction, or an indication of respect. An actor looks for _applause;_ a speaker looks for _acclamation._ What a man does calls forth _applause_, but the person himself is mostly received with _acclamations._ At the hustings popular speeches meet with _applause_, and favorite members are greeted with loud _acclamations._

####appoint 
**APPOINT, ORDER, PRESCRIBE, ORDAIN.**  
_Appoint_ (see [allot](entry://allot)). _Order_, in French _ordre_, Latin _ordino_, to arrange, dispose, _ordo_, order, signifies to place in regular position. _Prescribe_, in Latin _prescribo_, compounded of _prœ_, before, and _scribere_, to write, signifies to draw a line for a person. _Ordain_ is a valuation of _order._  
To _appoint_ is either the act of an equal or superior: we _appoint_ a meeting with any one at a given time and place; a king _appoints_ his ministers. To _order_ is the act of one invested with partial authority: a customer _orders_ a commodity from his tradesman: a master gives his _orders_ to his servant. To _prescribe_ is the act of one who is superior by virtue of bis knowledge: a physician _prescribes_ for his patient. To _ordain_ is an act emanating from the highest authority: kings and councils _ordain;_ but their _ordinances_ must be conformable to what is _ordained_ by the Divine Being. _Appointments_ are made for the convenience of individuals or communities; but they may be altered or annulled at the pleasure of the contracting parties. _Orders_ are dictated by the superior only, but they presuppose a discretionary obligation on the part of the individual to whom they are given. _Prescriptions_ are binding on none but such as voluntarily admit their authority; but _ordinances_ leave no choice to those on whom they are imposed to accept or reject them: the _ordinances_ of man are not less binding than those of God, so long as they do not expressly contradict the divine law.  
_Appointments_ are kept, _orders_ executed or obeyed, _prescriptions_ followed, _ordinances_ submitted to. It is a point of politeness or honor, if not of direct moral obligation, to keep the _appointments_ which we have made. Interest will lead men to execute the _orders_ which they receive in the course of business: duty obliges them to obey the _orders_ of their superiors. It is a nice matter to _prescribe_ to another without hurting his pride; this principle leads men often to regard the counsels of their best friends as _prescriptions;_ with children it is an unquestionable duty to follow the _prescriptions_ of those whose age, station, or experience authorizes them to _prescribe._ God has _ordained_ all things for our good; it rests with ourselves to submit to His _ordinances_ and be happy.

####appraise 
**APPRAISE, APPRECIATE, ESTIMATE, ESTEEM.**  
_Appraise_ and _appreciate_, both from _appretio_ and _appretiatus_, participle of _apprecia_, compounded of _ad_ and _pretium_, a price, signify to set a price or value on a thing. _Estimate_ comes from _estimatus_, participle of _estimo_, to value. To _esteem_ is a variation of _estimate. Appraise_ and _appreciate_ are used in precisely the same sense for setting a value on anything according to relative circumstances; but the one is used in the proper, and the other in the figurative sense: a sworn _appraiser appraises_ goods according to the condition of the articles and their salable property; the characters of men are _appreciated_ by others when their good and bad qualities are justly put in a balance.  
To _estimate_ a thing is to get the sum of its value by calculation; to _esteem_ anything is to judge its actual and intrinsic value. _Estimate_ is used either in a proper or a figurative acceptation; _esteem_ only in a moral sense: the expense of an undertaking, losses by fire, gains by trade, are _estimated_ at a certain sum; the _estimate_ may be too high or too low: the moral worth of men is often _estimated_ above or below the reality, according to the particular bias of the _estimator;_ but there are individuals of such an unquestionable worth that they need only to be known in order to be _esteemed._

####appreciate 
See [appraise](entry://appraise)

####apprehend 
**APPREHEND, CONCEIVE, SUPPOSE, IMAGINE.**  
To _apprehend_, from the Latin _ad_ and _prehendo_, I lay hold of, signifies to take. _Conceive_, from the Latin _con_ and _capio_, to take together — that is, to put together in the mind. _Suppose_, from the Latin _suppono_, to put one thing in the place of another. _Imagine_, from _imago_, to have an _image_ or figure of anything in the mind.  
To _apprehend_ is simply to take an idea into the mind; thus we may _apprehend_ any object that we hear or see: to _conceive_ is to form an idea in the mind, as to _conceive_ the idea of doing anything, to _conceive_ a design.  
_Apprehending_ is the first effort of the thinking faculty: _conceiving_ is the act of a more matured understanding; the former belongs to children as well as grown persons, the latter more properly to grown persons. _Apprehending_ is performed by the help of the senses; we may be quick or dull of _apprehension. Conceiving_ is performed by reflection and combination: we may _conceive_ properly or improperly.  
That of which we can have no sensible impression is not to be _apprehended_, that which is above the reach of our thought is not to be _conceived._  
To _apprehend_ and to _conceive_ are applied only to reality, to _suppose_ and _imagine_ are applied to things which may exist only in the imagination; but the former being drawn from that which is real may be probable or improbable according to circumstances; the latter being the peculiar act of the imagination, more commonly exists in the imagination only.  
These terms are all employed to denote one's opinion or belief in regard to ordinary matters with a like distinction. _Apprehend_ expresses the weakest kind of belief, the having the least idea of the presence of a thing.  
A man is said to _conceive_ that on which he forms a direct opinion.  
What one _supposes_ may admit of a doubt; it is frequently only conjectural.  
What one _imagines_ may be altogether improbable or impossible, and that which cannot be _imagined_ may be too improbable to admit of being believed.  
**APPREHEND, FEAR, DREAD.** — _Apprehend_ signifies to have an idea of danger in one's mind, without necessarily implying any sentiment of fear. _Fear_, Anglo-Saxon _fœr_, a sudden peril or danger, referred originally to the peril of travelling, and is allied to _faran_, modern _fare_, meaning to travel. _Dread_, Anglo-Saxon _drœdan_, to be afraid, expresses the highest degree of fear.  
What is possible may be _apprehended;_ we may _apprehend_ a change in the weather, or that an accident will take place by the way. What is probable may be _feared;_ we may fear the consequences of a person's resentment. Not only the evil which is nigh, but that which is exceeding great, produces _dread. Apprehend_ is said only of things. _Fear_ and _dread_ are also applied to persons with the like distinction: _fear_ is a salutary sentiment; it is the sentiment of a child toward a parent or instructor: _dread_, as toward a fellow-creature, is produced by harshness and oppression, but in regard to our Maker is produced by the consciousness of guilt.

####approach 
**APPROACH, ACCESS, ADMITTANCE.**  
_Approach_, Old French _aprochier_, from Latin _prope_, near, signifies near to — that is, coming near to. Access, in Latin _accessus_, from _ac_ or _ad_, and _cedere_, to go, is, properly, going to. _Admittance_ (see [admit](entry://admit)).  
_Approach_ signifies the coming near or toward an object, and consequently is an unfinished act, but _access_ and _admittance_ are finished acts; _access_ is the coming to — that is, as close to an object as is needful; and _admittance_ is the coming into any place or into the presence or society of any person. _Approach_ expresses simply the act of drawing near, but _access_ and _admittance_ comprehend, in their signification, the liberty and power of coming to or into: an _approach_ may be quick or slow, an _access_ easy or difficult, an _admittance_ free or exclusive.  
_Approach_ may sometimes be taken for a road or way of _approach_, which •brings it nearer in sense to the other terms, as the _approaches_ to a bridge or a town.  
_Access_ is used only in its proper sense for the act of persons; _approach_ and _admittance_ are employed figuratively, as the _approach_ of winter, age, etc., or the _approach_ to immortality, in the sense of coming near to it in similitude, the _admittance_ of immoral thoughts into the mind.  
**APPROACH, APPROXIMATE.** — _Approach_ (see preceding use). _Approximate_, compound of _ap_ and _proximus_, to come nearest or next, signifies either to draw near or bring near. To _approach_ is intransitive only; a person _approaches_ an object. To _approximate_ is both transitive and intransitive; a person _approximates_ two objects to each other.  
To _approach_ denotes simply the moving of an object toward another, but to _approximate_ denotes the gradual moving of two objects toward each other: that which _approaches_ may come into immediate conjunction; but bodies may _approximate_ for some time before they form a junction, or may never form a junction. An equivocation _approaches_ to a lie. Minds _approximate_ by long intercourse. 

####approbation 
See [assent](entry://assent); [consent](entry://consent)

####appropriate 
**APPROPRIATE, USURP, ARROGATE, ASSUME, ASCRIBE.**  
_Appropriate_, in French _approprier_, compounded of _ad_ and _propriatus_, participle of _propriare_, an old verb, and _proprius_, proper or own (compare _proper)_, signifies to make one's own. _Usurp_, in French _usurper_, Latin _usurpo_, from _usu rapere_, to seize for one's own use, signifies to make use of as one's own. _Arrogate_, in Latin _arrogatus_, participle of _arrogo_, signifies to ask or claim for one's self. _Assume_, in French _assumer_, Latin _assumo_, compounded of _as_ or _ad_ and _sumo_, to take, signifies to take to one's self. _Ascribe_, in Latin _ascribo_, compounded of _ad_ and _scribo_, write, signifies here to write down to one's own account.  
The idea of taking something to one's self by an act of one's own is common to all these terms. To _appropriate_ is to take to one's self with or without right; to _usurp_ is to take to one's self by violence or in violation of right. _Appropriating_ is applied in its proper sense to goods in possession; _usurping_ is properly applied to power, titles, rights. Individuals _appropriate_ whatever comes to their hands which they use as their own; they _usurp_ power when they exercise the functions of government without a legitimate sanction.  
These words may be applied in the same sense to moral or spiritual objects.  
_Arrogate, assume_, and _ascribe_ denote the taking to one's self, but do not, like _appropriate_ and _usurp_, imply taking from another. _Arrogate_ is a more violent action than _assume_, and _assume_ than _ascribe. Arrogate_ and _assume_ are employed either in the proper or figurative sense, _ascribe_ only in the figurative sense. We _arrogate_ distinctions, honors, titles; we _assume_ names; rights, and privileges. In the moral sense we _arrogate_ pre-eminence, _assume_ importance, _ascribe_ merit. To _arrogate_ is a species of moral _usurpation;_ it is always accompanied with haughtiness and contempt for others: that is _arrogated_ to one's self to which one has not the smallest title: an _arrogant_ temper is one of the most odious features in the human character; it is a compound of folly and insolence. To _assume_ is a species of moral _appropriation;_ its objects are of a less serious nature than those of _arrogating_, and it does less violence to moral propriety: we may _assume_ in trifles, we _arrogate_ only in important matters. To _ascribe_ is oftener an act of vanity than of injustice: many men may be entitled to the merit which they _ascribe_ to themselves; but by this very act they lessen the merit of their best actions.  
_Arrogating_ as an action, or _arrogance_ as a disposition, is always taken in a bad sense: the former is always dictated by the most preposterous pride; the latter is associated with every unworthy quality. _Assumption_ as an action varies in its character according to circumstances; it may be either good, had, or indifferent: it is justifiable in certain exigencies to _assume_ a command where there is no one else able to direct; it is often a matter of indifference what name a person _assumes_ who does so only in conformity to the will of another; but it is always bad to _assume_ a name as a mask to impose upon others. As a disposition _assumption_ is always bad, but still not to the same degree as _arrogance._ An _arrogant_ man renders himself intolerable to society: an _assuming_ man makes himself offensive: _arrogance_ is the characteristic of men; _assumption_ is peculiar to youths: an _arrogant_ man can be humbled only by silent contempt; an _assuming_ youth must be checked by the voice of authority.

####arbitrate 
**ARBITRATE, ADJUST, DECIDE, DETERMINE, MEDIATE, SETTLE.**  
_Arbitrate_ (for derivation see [judge](entry://judge)) means to decide as an outsider, an impartial judge. _Adjust_ (not derived from justice, but from _ad_ and _juxta_, next to) meant originally to put side by side, to put something into a proper relation to something else. _Decide_ is derived from _de_ and _cœdere_, to cut, and means to cut off, hence to end. _Determine_ comes from Latin _de_ and _terminare_, from _terminus_, limit, and meant to decide the limits of something. _Mediate_, from Latin _medius_, middle, meant to act as a go-between. _Settle_ meant to cause to rest, from Anglo-Saxon _setl_, seat (compare the noun _settle_, a seat). It received the special sense of to establish peace between two combatants, from an association with the Anglo-Saxon _sœht_, the end of a suit, allied to the verb _sacan_, to contend, which appears in _forsake._ Of these terms _mediate_ and _arbitrate_ refer especially to the difficulties that arise between states or between other organized groups of individuals. To _mediate_ involves an action prior to arbitration, for it is based upon a tender of the "good offices" of a neutral nation to others in a dispute or war. In case it is accepted the _mediating_ nation may become the _arbitrator_ or the dispute may be submitted to another form of _arbitration_ — that is, final decision concerning the justice of the case by an impartial court. For an analysis of the difference between _decide_ and _determine_ see the article on _decide. Decide_ and _determine_ refer to purely intellectual operations. One may _decide_ or _determine_ the rights of a case without proceeding to _adjust_ the difficulties or to _settle_ the disturbance. _Adjust_ and _settle_ imply active participation. _Adjust_ and _settle_ differ mainly in the connotations suggested by their derivations. We _adjust_ matters where the trouble is due to a lack of mutual understanding between two conflicting parties. We _settle_ a disturbance where conflicting claims cannot be _adjusted_ by superior force or authority.

####architect 
**ARCHITECT, BUILDER.**  
_Architect_, from architecture, in Latin _architectus_, from _architectura_, Greek _αρχιτέκτων_, compounded of _άρχος_, the chief, and _τέχνη_, art or contrivance, signifies the chief of contrivers. _Builder_, from the verb to _build_, denotes the person concerned in buildings, who causes the structure of houses, either by his money or his personal service. An _architect_ is an artist, employed only to form the plans for large buildings; a _builder_ is a simple tradesman, or even workman, who _builds_ common dwelling-houses.

####argue 
**ARGUE, DISPUTE, DEBATE.**  
_Argue_ comes from Latin _arguere_, to make clear. _Dispute_, in French _disputer_, Latin _dispute_, compounded of _dis_ and _puto_, signifies to think differently; in an extended sense, to assert a different opinion. _Debate_, in French _débattre_, compounded of the intensive syllable _de_ and _battre_, to beat or fight, signifies to contend for and against.  
To _argue_ is to defend one's self; to _dispute_, to oppose another; to _debate_, to dispute in a formal manner. To _argue_ on a subject is to explain the reasons or proofs in support of an assertion; to _argue_ with a person is to defend a position against him: to _dispute_ a thing is to advance objections against a position; to _dispute_ with a person is to start objections against his positions, to attempt to refute them: a _debate_ is a disputation held by many. To _argue_ does not necessarily suppose a conviction on the part of the arguer that what he defends is true, nor a real difference of opinion in his opponent; for some men have such an itching propensity for an _argument_ that they will attempt to prove what nobody denies: to _dispute_ always supposes an opposition to some person, but not a sincere opposition to the thing; for we may _dispute_ that winch we do not deny, for the sake of holding a _dispute_ with one who is of different sentiments: to _debate_ presupposes a multitude of clashing or opposing opinions. Men of many words _argue_ for the sake of talking: men of ready tongues _dispute_ for the sake of victory: in parliament men often _debate_ for the sake of opposing the ruling party, or from any other motive than the love of truth.  
**ARGUE, EVINCE, PROVE.** — _Argue_ (see above). _Evince_, in Latin _evince_, compounded of _vinco_, to _prove_, or make out, and _e_, forth, signifies to bring to light, to make to appear clear. _Prove_, in French _prouver_, in Latin _probo_, from_ probus_, good, signifies to make good or to make to appear good.  
These terms in general convey the idea of _evidence_, but with gradations: _argue_ denotes the smallest, and _prove_ the highest degree. To _argue_ is to serve as an indication amounting to probability; to _evince_ denotes an indication so clear as to remove doubt; to _prove_ marks an _evidence_ so positive as to produce conviction. It _argues_ a want of candor in any man to conceal circumstances in his statement which are in any wise calculated to affect the subject in question: the tenor of a person's conversation may _evince_ the refinement of his mind and the purity of his taste: when we see men sacrificing their peace of mind and even their integrity of character to ambition it _proves_ to us how important it is even in early life to check this natural and in some measure laudable, but still insinuating and dangerous, passion.  
**ARGUMENT, REASON, PROOF.** — _Argument_, from _argue_, signifies either the thing that _argues_, or that which is brought forward in _arguing. Reason_, in French _raison_, Latin _ratio_, from _ratus_, participle of _reor_, think, signifies the faculty of mind which draws conclusions. _Proof_, like _prove_, is derived ultimately from Latin _probus_, good, excellent, and means that which tests and reveals the excellence of something.  
An _argument_ serves for defence; a _reason_ for justification; a _proof_ for conviction. _Arguments_ are adduced in support of a hypothesis or proposition; _reasons_ are assigned in matters of belief and practice; _proofs_ are collected to ascertain a fact.  
_Arguments_ are either strong or weak; _reasons_ solid or futile; _proofs_ clear and positive, or vague and indefinite. We confute an _argument_, overpower a _reason_, and invalidate a _proof._ Whoever wished to defend Christianity will be in no want of _arguments;_ the believer need never be at a loss to give a _reason_ for the hope that is in him; but throughout the whole of Divine Revelation there is no circumstance that is substantiated with such irrefragable _proofs_ as the resurrection of our Saviour. 

####arise 
**ARISE, or RISE, MOUNT, ASCEND, CLIMB, SCALE.**  
_Arise_ or _rise_, derived from a root signifying to move, found in _river, rivulet_, etc., means specifically to move in an upward direction. _Ascend_ is derived from _ad_, to, and _scandere_, to climb, from a root found in _scandal_ (originally a stumbling-block), and means to climb to something. _Climb_ means to ascend by grasping, and is derived from a Germanic root signifying to grasp, found in _clip, cleave, clamber_, etc. _Scale_ is derived from Latin _scala_ (from the same root found in _ascend)_, that by which one _ascends_, and means to rise by a ladder.  
The idea of going upward is common to all these terms; _arise_ is used only in the sense of simply getting up, but _rise_ is employed to express a continued motion upward: a person _arises_ from his seat or his bed; a bird _rises_ in the air; the silver of the barometer _rises;_ the first three of these terms convey a gradation in their sense; to _arise_ or _rise_ denotes a motion to a less elevated height than to _mount_, and to _mount_ that which is less elevated than _ascend;_ a person _rises_ from his seat, _mounts_ a hill, and _ascends_ a mountain. _Arise_ and _rise_ are intransitive only; the rest are likewise transitive: we _rise_ from a point, we _mount_ and _ascend_ to a point, or we _mount_ and _ascend_ something: an air-balloon rises when it first leaves the ground; it _mounts_ higher and higher until it is out of sight; but if it _ascends_ too high it endangers the life of the aerial adventurer. _Climb_ and _scale_ express a species of rising: to _climb_ is to _rise_ step by step by dinging to a certain body; to _scale_ is to rise by an escalade, or species of ladder, employed in _mounting_ the walls of fortified towns: trees and mountains are _climbed;_ walls are _scaled. Arise_ or **RISE, PROCEED, ISSUE, SPRING, FLOW, EMANATE.** — To arise (see above). _Proceed_, in Latin _procedo_, that is, _pro_ and _cedere_, to go, signifies to go forth. _Issue_ is French _issue_, participle of _issir_ (from _ex_, out of, and _ire_, to go. _Spring_, in German _springen_, signifies to leap forth. _Flow_, Anglo-Saxon _flowan_, is derived from a Germanic root allied to the Latin _pluit_, it rains, and the Greek _πλωειν_, to float. It has no connection with the Latin _fluere_, to flow. _Emanate_, in Latin _emanatus_, participle of _emano_, from _ex,_ out, and _manare_, to flow, means to flow out.  
The idea of one object coming out of another is expressed by all these terms, but they differ in the circumstances of the action. What comes up out of a body and rises into existence is said to _arise_, as the mist which _arises_ out of the sea: what comes forth as an effect, or comes forth in a particular manner, is said to _proceed;_ thus the light _proceeds_ from a certain quarter of the heavens, or from a certain part of a house: what comes out from a small aperture is said to _issue;_ thus perspiration _issues_ through the pores of the skin; water _issues_ sometimes from the sides of rocks; what comes out in a sudden or quick manner, or comes from some remote source, is said to _spring;_ thus blood _springs_ from an artery which is pricked; water _springs_ up out of the earth: what comes out in quantities or in a stream is said to _flow;_ thus blood _flows_ from a wound: to _emanate_ is a species of _flowing_ by a natural operation, when bodies send forth, or seem to send forth, particles of their own composition from themselves; thus light _emanates_ from the sun.  
This distinction in the signification of these terms is kept up in their moral acceptation, where the idea of one thing originating from another is common to them all; but in this case arise is a general term, which simply implies the coming into existence; _proceed_ conveys also the idea of a progressive movement into existence. Every object, therefore, may be said to _arise_ out of whatever produces it; but it _proceeds_ from it only when it is gradually produced: evils are continually _arising_ in human society for which there is no specific remedy: in complicated disorders it is not always possible to say precisely from what the complaint of the patient _proceeds. Issue_ is seldom used but in application to sensible objects: yet we may say, in conformity to the original meaning, that words _issue_ from the mouth: the idea of the distant source or origin is kept up in the moral application of the term _spring_, when we say that actions _spring_ from a generous or corrupt principle: the idea of a quantity and a stream is preserved in the moral use of the terms _flow_ and _emanate;_ but the former may be said of that which is not inherent in the body; the latter respects that only which forms a component part of the body: God is the _spring_ whence all our blessings _flow;_ all authority _emanates_ from God, who is the supreme source of all things; theologians, when speaking of God, say that the Son _emanates_ from the Father, and the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son, and that grace _flows_ upon us incessantly from the inexhaustible treasures of Divine mercy. 

####armistice 
See [truce](entry://truce)

####arms 
**ARMS, WEAPONS.**  
_Arms_, from the Latin _arma_, literally fittings, equipments, from the root signifying to join or fashion found in _art, arm_ (a part of the human body), etc., is now properly used for instruments of offence, and never otherwise except by a poetic license of _arms_ for armor; but _weapon_, from a widespread Germanic root, may be used either for an instrument of offence or defence. We say _fire-arms_, but not _fire-weapons;_ and _weapons_ offensive or defensive, not _arms_ offensive or defensive. _Anns_, likewise, agreeably to its origin, is employed for that only which is purposely made to be an instrument of offence; _weapon_, according to its extended and indefinite application, is employed for whatever may be accidentally used for this purpose: guns and swords are always _arms;_ stones, brick-bats, and pitchforks, and also the tongue or words, may be occasionally _weapons._

####army 
**ARMY, HOST.**  
An _army_ is an organized body of _armed_ men; a _host_, from _hostis_, an enemy, is properly a body of _hostile_ men. An _army_ is a limited body; a _host_ may be unlimited, and is therefore generally considered a very large body.  
The word _army_ applies only to that which has been formed by the rules of art for purposes of war: _host_ has been extended in its application not only to bodies, whether of men or angels, that were assembled for purposes of offence, but also in the figurative sense to whatever rises up to assail.

_Arrogance_, in French _arrogance_, Latin _arrogantia_, signifies the disposition to _arrogate_ (see [appropriate](entry://appropriate)). _Presumption_, from _presume_, Latin _prœsumo_, compounded of _prœ_, before, and _sumere_, itself compounded from _sub_ and _emere_, to buy, and meaning to put or take, signifies the disposition to put one's self forward.  
_Arrogance_ is the act of the great; _presumption_ that of the little: the _arrogant_ man takes upon himself to be above others; the _presumptuous_ man strives to be on a level with those who are above him. _Arrogance_ is commonly coupled with haughtiness; _presumption_ with meanness: men _arrogantly_ demand as a right the homage which has perhaps before been voluntarily granted; the creature _presumptuously_ arraigns the conduct of the Creator, and murmurs against the dispensations of His providence.

####art 
**ART, CUNNING, DECEIT.**  
_Art, in_ Latin _ars_, from a root _ar_, to join (see _arms)_, allied to Greek _άρτιος_, fit, exact, signifies literally the "putting of two and two together. " _Cunning is_ derived from Anglo-Saxon _cunnan_, to know, and therefore corresponds exactly to the colloquial adjective _knowing_, in such phrases as "a _knowing_ look, "a _knowing_ child, " etc. _Deceit_, in Latin _deceptum_, participle of _decipio_, or _de_ and _capio_, signifies to take by surprise or unawares.  
_Art_ implies a disposition of the mind to use circumvention or artificial means to attain an end: _cunning_ marks the disposition to practise disguise in the prosecution of a plan: _deceit_ leads to the practice of dissimulation and gross falsehood, for the sake of gratifying a desire. _Art_ is the property of a lively mind; _cunning_, of a thoughtful and knowing mind; _deceit_, of an ignorant, low, and weak mind. _Art_ is practised often in self-defence; as a practice, therefore, it is even sometimes justifiable, although not as a disposition: _cunning_ has always self in view; the _cunning_ man seeks his gratification without regard to others; _deceit_ is often practised to the express injury of another: the _deceitful_ man adopts base means for base ends. Animals practise _art_ when opposed to their superiors in strength; but they are not _artful_, as they have not that versatility of power which they can habitually exercise to their own advantage like human beings; animals may be _cunning_, inasmuch as they can by contrivance and concealment seek to obtain the object of their desire, but no animal is _deceitful_ except man; the wickedest and stupidest of men have the power and the will of _deceiving_ and practising falsehood upon others which is unknown to the brutes.

**ARTFUL, ARTIFICIAL, FICTITIOUS.** — _Artful_, compounded of _art_ and _full_, marks the quality of being full of _art. Artificial_, in Latin _artificialis_, from _ars_ and _facio_, to do, signifies done with _art. Fictitious_, in Latin _fictitius_, from _fingere_ to reign (compare article on _feign)_, signifies the qualitv of being _feigned. Artful_ respects what is done with art or design; _artificial_ what is done by the exercise of workmanship; _fictitious_ what is made out of the mind. _Artful_ and_ artificial_ are used either for natural or moral objects; _fictitious_ always for those that are moral: _artful_ is opposite to what is _artless, artificial_ to what is natural, _fictitious_ to what is real: the ringlets of a lady's hair are disposed in an _artful_ manner; the hair itself pay be _artificial;_ a tale is _artful_ which is told in a way to gain credit; manners are _artificial_ which do not seem to suit the person adopting them; a story is _fictitious_ which has no foundation whatever in truth and is the invention of the narrator. Children sometimes tell their stories so _artfully_ as to impose on the most penetrating and experienced. Those who have no character of their own are induced to take an _artificial_ character in order to put themselves on a level with their associates. Beggars deal in _fictitious_ tales of distress in order to excite compassion.

####article 
**ARTICLE, CONDITION, TERM.**  
_Article_, in French _article_, Latin _articulus_, a joint or a part of a member. _Condition_ is usually believed to be derived from the Latin _condere_, to build. Skeat declares that this is incorrect. The Latin _conditio_ is derived from _con_ and a root found in _dicere_, to speak, meaning to point out. _Term_ is derived from Latin _terminus_, Greek _τέρμα_, from the root meaning to cross over.  
These words agree in their application to matters of compact, or understanding between man and man. _Article_ and _condition_ are used in both numbers: _terms_ only in the plural in this sense: the former may be used for any point individually; the latter for all the points collectively: _article_ is employed for all matters which are drawn out in specific _articles_ or _points;_ as the _articles_ of an indenture, of a capitulation, or an agreement. _Condition_ respects any point that is admitted as a ground of obligation or engagement: it is used for the general transactions of men, in which they reciprocally hind themselves to return certain equivalents. The word _terms_ is employed in regard to mercantile transactions; as the _terms_ of any bargain, the _terms_ of any agreement, the _terms_ on which anything is bought or sold. _Articles_ are mostly voluntary; they are admitted by mutual agreement: _conditions_ are frequently compulsory, sometimes hard; they are submitted to from policy or necessity; _terms_ are dictated by interest or equity; they are fair or unfair according to the temper of the parties; they are submitted or agreed to. 

####articulate

####artifice 
**ARTIFICE, TRICK, FINESSE, STRATAGEM.**  
_Artifice_, from French _artifice_, Latin _artifex_, an _artificer_, and _artem facio_, to execute an art, signifies the performance of an art. _Trick_ is derived from Dutch and originally meant a clever contrivance. _Finesse_, a word directly imported from France, with all the meaning attached to it which is characteristic of the nation itself, means properly fineness; the: word _fin_ in French is derived from Latin _finitus_, meaning well finished. _Stratagem_, in French _stratagème_, from the Greek _στρατήγημα_ and _στρατηγέω, to_ lead an army, signifies by distinction to head them in carrying on any scheme.  
All these terms denote the exercise of an art calculated to mislead others. _Artifice_ is the generic term, the rest are specific: the former has likewise a particular use and acceptation distinct from the others; it expresses a ready display of art for the purpose of extricating one's self from a difficulty, or securing to one's self an advantage. _Trick_ includes in it more of design to gain something for one's self, or to act secretly to the inconvenience of others: it is rather a cheat on the senses than the understanding. _Finesse_ is a species of artifice in which art and cunning are combined in the management of a cause: it is a mixture of invention, falsehood, and concealment. _Stratagem_ is a display of art in plotting and contriving, a disguised mode of obtaining an end. Females who are not guarded by fixed principles of virtue and uprightness are apt to practise _artifices_ upon their husbands. Men without honor, or an honorable means of living, are apt to practise various _tricks_ to impose upon others to their own advantage: every trade, therefore, is said to have its _tricks;_ and professions are not entirely clear from this stigma, which has been brought upon them by unworthy members. Diplomatic persons have most frequent recourse to _finesse._ Military operations are sometimes considerably forwarded by well-concerted and well-timed _stratagems_ to surprise the enemy.  
An _artifice_ may be perfectly innocent when it serves to afford a friend an unexpected pleasure. A _trick_ is childish which only serves to deceive or amuse children. _Stratagems_ are allowable not in war only; the writer of a novel or a play may sometimes adopt a successful _stratagem_ to cause the reader a surprise. _Finesse_ is never justifiable; it carries with it too much of concealment and disingenuousness to be practised but for selfish and unworthy purposes.

####artist 
**ARTIST, ARTISAN, ARTIFICER, MECHANIC.**  
_Artist_ is the practicer of the fine arts (for derivation see [art](entry://art)); _artisan_ the practicer of the vulgar arts. _Artificer_ comes from _ars_ and _facio_, one who does or makes according to art. _Mechanic_, from Greek _μηχανική_, a machine, a device, signifies one who works with machines.  
The _artist_ ranks higher than the _artisan_, the former requires intellectual refinement, the latter nothing but to know the common practice of art. The musician, painter, and sculptor are _artists;_ the carpenter, the sign-painter, and the blacksmith are _artisans._ The _artificer_ is an intermediate term between the _artist_ and the _artisan;_ manufacturers are _artificers;_ and, in an extended sense, any one who makes a thing by his contrivance is an _artificer._ The _mechanic_ is that species of artisan who works at arts purely _mechanical_, in distinction from those which contribute to the completion and embellishment of any objects; on this ground a shoemaker is a _mechanic_, but a common painter is a simple _artisan._

####ascetic 
**ASCETIC, AUSTERE, RIGID, STERN.**  
_Ascetic_ in French _ascétique_, from _άσκειν_, to work, exercise, applied, literally, to the practice of an art, hence to an athlete, and, by extension, to the discipline practised by an athlete. In the schools of the stoics, the term that implied this discipline practised by the wrestlers was employed to designate the practice of mastering the desires and passions or of severe virtue, and in this sense it passed into the language of the early Christians: on this basis the modern meaning of a person unduly rigid or _austere_ was derived.  
_Austere_ is derived from Latin _austerus_, harsh, sour, tart, from Greek _αυστηρός_, making the tongue dry, harsh, bitter. It signifies a manner, a temperament, and does not so distinctly imply the mastering of the physical appetites as does the word _ascetic._ Similarly _stern_, from Anglo-Saxon _styrne_, of harsh mind, refers to a kind of temper. _Austerity_ suggests both the habits of life indicated in _asceticism_ and the kind of nature suggested by _sternness._ A man may be _stern_ and, at the same time, be the opposite of _ascetic. Rigid_, from Latin _rigidus_ (whence _rigorous_ is also derived by way of French), comes from the Latin _rigere_, to be stiff or straight. It refers both to the property of physical things and, figuratively, to a certain habit of mind or of life. _Stern_ refers to a kind of emotional temperament; _rigid_ suggests an intellectual habit, an unbending mind, whence certain characteristics of temper and habits of living might develop. 

####ascribe 
**ASCRIBE, IMPUTE, ATTRIBUTE.**  
To _ascribe_ signifies here generally to write or set down in one's own mind to a person (see [appropriate](entry://appropriate)) — that is, to assign anything in one's estimate as the possession or the property of another, as to _ascribe_ honor or power. To _impute_, from _im_ or _in_ and _puto_, think, is to form an estimate of a person; as to _impute_ a thing to a person's folly. To _attribute_, from _ad_ and _tribuo_, bestow, is to assign a thing as a cause; as to _attribute_ the loss of a vessel to the violence of the storm.  
What is _ascribed_ and _imputed_ is mostly of a personal nature, either to honor or dishonor; _ascribe_ more frequently for the former, _impute_ for the latter. In the doxology of the church ritual, all honor, might, majesty, dominion, and power are _ascribed_ to the three persons in the Holy Trinity; men of right minds cannot bear the slightest _imputation_ on their honor, nor virtuous women the slightest _imputation_ on their chastity.  
_Ascribe_ may, however, sometimes be employed in an unfavorable sense, and _impute_ in a favorable sense. We may _ascribe_ imperfection as well as perfection, and _impute_ good as well as bad motives.  
To _ascribe_ may also denote to assign a cause, which brings it nearer in sense to _attribute;_ but the former always refers to some characteristic of the person, and the latter, although applied to personal qualities, conveys no personal reflection.  
To _ascribe_ is always to assign to some individual person; but to _attribute_ may either refer to no persons, or to none individually. Milton _ascribes_ the first use of artillery to the devil: the Letters of Junius have been _ascribed_ successively to many as the author; the death of many persons may be _attributed_ to intemperance. 

####aseptic 
**ASEPTIC, GERMLESS, NON-PUTREFYING. **  
_Aseptic_, a compound of the Greek _άσηπτος_ (from _ά_ privative and _σηπτικός_, putrefying) and the English suffix _ic_, signifies that which is not liable to putrefaction, or that which is _germless_ or free from septic matter, or any substance that produces or promotes putrefaction; in the substantive form, _asepsis_, the absence of toxinous or pathogenic bacteria which poison the blood. From the original Greek term we have _septicaemia_, an acute disease resembling pyaemia in its general characteristics, supposed to be caused by the introduction into the blood of putrid matter from the surface of a wound or ulcer, the putrefaction now being known, through the antiseptic researches of Pasteur and Lister, to be a fermentative change due to the presence of certain micro-organisms in the blood.  
_Antiseptic surgery_ is the operation of introducing antiseptic solutions into a wound whence the poisonous matter has been carried into the blood, or where the wound has not been promptly treated by antisepsis, or the exclusion of microbes or bacteria from wounds and open sores. 

####ask 
**ASK, BEG, REQUEST.**  
_Ask_, in Anglo-Saxon _ascian_, is derived from a Germanic root signifying to wish. _Beg_ is derived, by a somewhat complicated process, from a frequentative of _bid_, and meant to bid often, to ask again and again. _Request_, in Latin _requisitus_, participle of _require_, is compounded of _re_ and _quœrere_, to seek or look after, with indications of desire to possess.  
The expression of a wish to some one to have something is the common idea comprehended in these terms. As this is the simple signification of _ask_, it is the generic term; the other two are specific; we _ask in begging_ and _requesting_, but not _vice versa. Asking_ is peculiar to no rank or station; in consequence of our mutual dependence on each other, it is requisite for every man to _ask_ something of another: the master _asks_ of the servant, the servant _asks_ of the master; the parent _asks_ of the child, the child _asks_ of the parent. _Begging_ marks a degree of dependence which is peculiar to inferiors in station; we _ask_ for matters of indifference; we _beg_ that which we think is of importance: a child _asks_ a favor of his parent; a poor man _begs_ the assistance of one who is able to afford it: that is _asked_ for which is easily granted; that is _begged_ which is with difficulty obtained. To _ask_, therefore, requires no effort, but to _beg_ is to _ask_ with importunity: those who by merely _asking_ find themselves unable to obtain what they wish, will have recourse to _begging. As ask_ sometimes implies a demand, and _beg_ a vehemence of desire or strong degree of necessity, politeness has adopted another phrase, which conveys neither the imperiousness of the one nor the urgency of the other; this is the word _request. Asking_ carries with it an air of superiority; _begging_ that of submission; _requesting_ has the air of independence and equality. _Asking_ borders too nearly on an infringement of personal liberty; _begging_ imposes a constraint by making an appeal to the feelings; _requests_ leave the liberty of granting or refusing unencumbered. It is the character of impertinent people to _ask_ without considering the circumstances and situation of the person _asked;_ they seem ready to take without permission that which is _asked_, if it be not granted: selfish and greedy people _beg_ with importunity, and in a tone that admits of no refusal; men of good breeding tender their _requests_ with moderation and discretion; they _request_ nothing but what they are certain can be conveniently complied with.  
_Ask is_ altogether excluded from polite life, although _beg_ is not. We may _beg_ a person's acceptance of anything; we may _beg_ him to favor or honor us with his company; but we can never talk of _asking_ a person's acceptance, or _asking_ him to do us an honor. _Beg_ in such cases indicates a condescension which is sometimes not unbecoming, but on ordinary occasions _request_ is with more propriety substituted in its place.  
**ASK, OR ASK FOR, CLAIM, DEMAND.** — _Ask_ (see above). _Claim_, in Old French _claimer_, Latin _clamo_, to cry after, signifies to express an imperious wish for. _Demand_, in French _demander_, is derived from Old French _de_ and _mander_, to order from the hands of another (from _manus_, hand), and hence to ask for that which has been intrusted.  
_Ask_, in the sense of _beg_, is confined to the expression of wishes on the part of the _asker_, without involving any obligation on the part of the person _asked;_ all granted in this case is voluntary, or complied with as a favor; but _ask for_, in the sense here taken, is involuntary, and springs from the forms and distinctions of society. _Ask_ is here, as before, generic or specific; _claim_ and _demand_ are specific: in its specific sense it conveys a less peremptory sense than either _claim_ or _demand._ To _ask for_ denotes simply the expressed wish to have what is considered as due; to _claim_ is to assert a right or to make it known; to _demand_ is to insist on having, without the liberty of a refusal. _Asking_ respects obligation in general, great or small; _claim_ respects supposes a right not questionable; _claim_ supposes a right hitherto unacknowledged; _demand_ supposes either a disputed right or the absence of all right, and the simple determination to have: a tradesman _asks_ for what is owed to him as circumstances may require; a person _claims_ the property he has lost; people are sometimes pleased to make _demands_ the legality of which cannot be proved. What is lent must be _asked for_ when it is wanted; whatever has been lost and is found must be recovered by a _claim;_ whatever a selfish person wants he strives to obtain by a _demand_, whether just or unjust.  
**ASK, INQUIRE, QUESTION, INTERROGATE.** — _Ask_ (see above). _Inquire_, Latin _inquire_, compounded of _in_ and _quœro_, signifies to search after. _Question_, in French _questionner_, signifies to put a question, from the Latin _quœstio_ and _quœro_, to seek or search, to look into. _Interrogate_, Latin _interrogatus_, participle of _interroge_, compounded of _inter_ and _rogo_, signifies to _ask._  
We perform all these actions in order to get information: but we _ask_ for general purposes of convenience; we _inquire_ from motives of curiosity; we _question_ and _interrogate_ from motives of discretion. To _ask_ respects simply one thing; to _inquire_ respects one or many subjects; to _question_ and _interrogate_ is to _ask_ repeatedly, and in the; fatter case more authoritatively than in the former. Indifferent people _ask_ of each other whatever they wish to know: learners _inquire_ the reasons of things which are new to them: masters _question_ their servants, or parents their children, when they wish to ascertain the real state of any case: magistrates _interrogate_ criminals when they are brought before them. It is very uncivil not to answer whatever is _asked_ even' by the meanest person: it is proper to satisfy every _inquiry_, so as to remove doubt: _questions axe_ sometimes so impertinent that they cannot with propriety be answered: _interrogations_ from unauthorized persons are little better than insults.

####asperse 
**ASPERSE, DETRACT, DEFAME, SLANDER, CALUMNIATE.**  
_Asperse_, in Latin _aspersus_, participle of _aspergere_, to sprinkle, allied to English _sprinkle_, signifies in a moral sense to stain with spots. _Detract_, in Latin _detractus_, participle of _detraho_, compounded of _de_ and _traho_, to draw from, signifies to take from another that which is his due, or which he desires to retain; particularly to take from the merit of an action. _Defame_, in Latin _defamo_, compounded of the privative _de_ and _fama_, from root _fari_, to speak, meaning reputation — that which others say about us — signifies to deprive of reputation. _Slander_, Middle English _sclandre_, is a doublet of _scandal_ (see [discredit](entry://discredit)), derived from Greek through Latin and French. _Calumniate_ is derived from Latin _calumnia_, from _caluere_, to deceive.  
All these terms denote an effort made to injure the character or estimation by some representation. _Asperse_ and _detract_ mark an indirect representation; _defame, slander_, and _calumniate_, a positive assertion. To _asperse_ is to fix a moral stain on a character; to _detract_ is to lessen its merits and excellences. _Aspersions_ always imply something bad, real or supposed; _detractions_ are Always founded on some supposed good in the object that is _detracted;_ to _defame_ is openly to advance some serious charge against the character; to _slander_ is to expose the faults of another in his absence; to _calumniate_ is to communicate secretly, or otherwise, false circumstances to the injury of another. If I speak slightingly of my neighbor, and insinuate anything against the purity of his principles or the rectitude of his conduct, I _asperse_ him: if he be a charitable man, and I ascribe his charities to a selfish motive, or otherwise take away from the merit of his conduct, I am guilty of _detraction;_ if I publish anything openly that, injures his reputation, I am a _defamer;_ if I communicate to others the reports that are in circulation to his disadvantage, I am a _slanderer;_ I fabricate anything myself and spread it abroad, I am a _calumniator._

####asphyxia 
**ASPHYXIA, SYNCOPE, SUFFOCATION.**  
_Asphyxia_, in French _asphyxie_, is from Latin _asphyxia_, Greek _ασφυξία_ the latter a compound of _α_, without, and _σφύξις_, the pulse, signifies, literally, a pulseless condition, the temporary or permanent cessation of the motions or throbbings of the heart, as in hanging, drowning, and suffocation, due to an interruption of the passage of the blood in the body which keeps it from its connection with the atmosphere by respiration, and so prevents a sufficiently free exchange of carbonic acid for oxygen. In its mild form we have _syncope_, from _συγ_ and _κόπτειν_, to cut. This is a fainting brought on by a sudden fright, illness, or a more than ordinarily disturbing spectacle. In its most severe or fatal form it becomes _suffocation_, the effect of a stoppage of respiration.  
The usual treatment of _asphyxia_ has recently been supplemented, with marked success, by the invention of the pulmotor, an apparatus designed to resuscitate victims of poisoning by gases and noxious fumes, electric shocks, suspended animation from any cause, drowning, attempted suicide, collapse in narcosis, and other mishaps, by forcing oxygen into the lungs. Many of the large gas companies now keep pulmotors on hand to send out in cases of accidental or intentional asphyxiation by illuminating gas.

####assemble 
**ASSEMBLE, MUSTER, COLLECT.**  
_Assemble_ is derived through French from Low Latin _assimulare_, from _ad_, to, and _simul_, together, from a root which also appears in _similar, same_, etc. _Muster_ comes from Latin _monstrari_, to show, and means specifically a review of troops. _Collect_ is derived from Latin _con_, together, and _legere_, to gather, from the root which also appears in _college, colleague_, etc.  
_Assemble_ is said of persons only; _muster_ and _collect_ of persons or things. To _assemble_ is to bring together by a call or invitation; to _muster_ is to bring together by an act of authority, or a particular effort, into one point of view at one time and from one quarter; to _collect_ is to bring together at, different times and from different quarters: the parliament is _assembled;_ soldiers are _mustered_ every day in order to ascertain their numbers; an army is _collected_ in preparation for war; a king _assembles_ his council in order to consult with them on public measures; a general _musters_ his forces before he undertakes an expedition, and _collects_ more troops if he finds himself too weak.  
_Collect_ is used for everything which can be brought together in numbers; _muster_ is used figuratively for bringing together, for an immediate purpose, whatever is in one's possession: books, coins, curiosities, and the like are _collected;_ a person's resources, his strength, courage, resolution, etc., are _mustered;_ some persons have a pleasure in _collecting_ all the pieces of antiquity which fall in their way; on a trying occasion it is necessary to _muster_ all the fortitude of which we are master.  
**ASSEMBLE, CONVENE, CONVOKE.** — _Assemble_ (see above). _Convene_, in Latin _convenio_, signifies to come or bring together. _Convoke_, in Latin _convoco_, signifies to call together.  
The idea of collecting many persons into one place, for a specific purpose, is common to all these terms. _Assemble_ conveys this sense without any addition; _convene_ and _convoke_ include likewise some collateral idea: people are_ assembled_, therefore, whenever they are _convened_ or _convoked_, but not _vice versa. Assembling_ is. mostly by the wish of one; _convening_ by that of several: a crowd is _assembled_ by an individual in the streets; a meeting is _convened_ at the desire of a certain number of persons: people are _assembled_ either on public or private business; they are always _convened_ on a public occasion. A king _assembles_ his parliament; a particular individual _assembles_ his friends; the inhabitants of a district are _convened._ There is nothing imperative on the part of those that _assemble_ or _convene_, and nothing binding on those _assembled_ or _convened;_ one _assembles_ or _convenes_ by invitation or request; one attends to the notice or not, at pleasure. _Convoke_, on the other hand, is an act of authority: it is the call of one who has the authority to give the call; it is heeded by those who feel themselves bound to attend.  
**ASSEMBLY, ASSEMBLAGE, GROUP, COLLECTION.** — _Assembly, assemblage_, are collective terms derived from the verb _assemble. Group_ comes through French from Italian _groppo_, which among painters signifies an _assemblage_ of figures in one place. _Collection_ expresses the act of _collecting_, or the body _collected. Assembly_ respects persons only; _assemblage_, things only; _group_ and _collection_, persons or things: an _assembly_ is any number either brought together or coming together of themselves; an _assemblage_ is any number of things standing together; a _group_ is come together by accident or put together by design; a _collection_ is mostly put or brought together by design. A general alarm will cause an _assembly_ to disperse; an agreeable _assemblage_ of rural objects, whether in nature or in representation, constitutes a landscape: a painting will sometimes consist only of a _group_ of figures; but if they be well chosen it will sometimes produce a wonderful effect: a _collection_ of evil-minded persons ought to be immediately dispersed by the authority of the magistrate. In a large _assembly_ you may sometimes observe a singular _assemblage_ of characters, countenances, and figures: when people come together in great numbers on any occasion, they will often form themselves into distinct _groups;_ the _collection_ of scarce books and curious editions has become a passion, which is ridiculed under the title of Bibliomania.  
**ASSEMBLY, COMPANY, MEETING, CONGREGATION, PARLIAMENT, DIET, CONGRESS, CONVENTION, SYNOD, CONVOCATION, COUNCIL.** — An _assembly_ is simply the _assembling_ together of any number of persons: this idea is common to all the rest of these terms, which differ in the object, mode, and other collateral circumstances of the action. _Company_, a body linked together (see [accompany](entry://accompany)), is an _assembly_ for purposes of _amusement. Meeting_, a body met together, is an _assembly_ for general purposes of business. _Congregation_, a body flocked or gathered together, from the Latin _grex_, a flock, is an _assembly_ brought together from congeniality of sentiment and community of purpose. _Parliament_ is derived through French _parler_, and a suffix from Latin _parabola_, Greek _παραβολή_, a speech in which two things are compared. (Compare _parable.) Diet_, from Greek _διαιτα_, a mode of life, has the same etymology as the word _diet_ applied to the mode of life in respect to food. The peculiar sense in which it is here used is due to a confusion of it in the popular mind with the Latin _dies_, day, especially a day set apart for public business; and so it came to mean an assembly which conducted public business. _Congress_, from the Latin _congredior_, to march in a body, is an _assembly_ coming together in a formal manner from distant parts for special purposes. _Convention_, from the Latin _convenio_, come together, is an _assembly_ coming together in an informal and promiscuous manner from a neighboring quarter. _Synod_, in Greek _σύνοδος_, compounded of _σύν_ and _οδός_, signifies literally going the same road, and has been employed to signify an _assembly_ for consultation on matters of religion. _Convocation_ is an _assembly convoked_ for an especial purpose. _Council_ is an _assembly_ for consultation either on civil or on ecclesiastical affairs.  
An _assembly_ is, in its restricted sense, public, and under certain regulations; a _company_ is private, and confined to friends and acquaintances; a _meeting_ is either public or private; a _congregation_ is always public. _Meetings_ are held by all who have any common concern to arrange; _congregations_ consist of those who pursue the same objects particularly in matters of religion, although extended in its application to other matters: all these different kinds of _assemblies_ are formed by individuals in their private capacity; the other terms designate _assemblies_ that come together for national purposes, with the exception of the word _convention_, which may be either domestic or political. A _parliament_ and _diet_ are popular _assemblies_ under a monarchical form of government; _congress_ and _convention_ are _assemblies_ under a republican government: of the first description is the _parliament_ of England, the _diets_ of Prussia and Finland _assembled_ by the reigning prince to deliberate on the affairs of the nation. Of the latter description is the _congress_ of the United States of America and the national _convention_ of France; but there is this difference observable between a _congress_ and a _convention_, that the former consists of deputies or delegates from higher authorities — that is, from independent governments already established; but a _convention_ is a self-constituted _assembly_, which has no power but what it assumes to itself. A _synod_ and _convocation_ are in religious matters what a _diet_ and _convention_ are in civil matters: the former exists only under an episcopal form of government; the latter may exist under any form of church discipline, even where the authority lies in the whole body of the ministry. A _council_ is more important than all other species of _assembly;_ it consists of persons invested with the highest authority, who, in their consultations, do not so much transact ordinary concerns as arrange the forms and fashions of things. Religious _councils_ used to determine matters of faith and discipline; political _councils_ frame laws and determine the fate of empires. 

####assent 
**ASSENT, CONSENT, APPROBATION, CONCURRENCE.**  
_Assent_, in Latin _assentio_, is compounded of _as or ad_ and _sentio_, to think, signifying to bring one's mind or judgment to a thing. _Consent_ (see [accede](entry://accede)). _Approbation_, in Latin _approbatio_, is compounded of _ad_ and _probo_, to prove, signifying to make a thing out good. _Concurrence_ (see [agree](entry://agree)).  
_Assent_ respects matters of judgment; _consent_ respects matters of conduct. We _assent_ to what we admit to be _true;_ we _consent_ to what we allow to be done. _Assent_ may be given to anything, whether positively proposed by another or not, but _consent_ supposes that what is _consented_ to is proposed by some other person. Some men give their hasty _assent_ to propositions which they do not fully understand, and their hasty _consent_ to measures which are Very injudicious. It is the part of the true believer not merely to _assent_ to the Christian doctrines, but to make them the rule of his life: those who _consent_ to a bad action are partakers in the guilt of it.  
_Assent_ and _consent_ may sometimes be both applied to matters of judgment or abstract propositions, but in that case _assent_ is the act of an individual, _consent_ is the act of many individuals: one _assents_ to that which is offered to his notice; some things are admitted by the common _consent_ of mankind.  
_Approbation_ is a species of _assent_, concurrence of consent. To _approve_ is not merely to _assent_ to a thing as right, but to determine upon it positively to be so; the word _assent_ is applied therefore most properly to speculative matters, or matters of inference or deduction; _approbation_ to practical matters or matters of conduct, as to give one's _assent_ to a proposition in Euclid, to express one's _approbation_ of a particular measure.  
_Concurrence_ is properly the _consent_ of many: _consent_ may pass between two individuals, namely, the party proposing and the party to whom the thing is proposed; but _concurrence_ is always given by numbers: _consent_ may be given by a party who has no personal interest in the thing _consented_ to; _concurrence_ is given by those who have a common interest in the thing proposed: _consent_ therefore passes between persons individually, _concurrence_ between communities or between men collectively.  
_Assent_ is given by equals or inferiors; it is opposed to contradiction or denial: _consent_ is given by superiors, or those who have the power of preventing; it is opposed to refusal: _approbation_ is given by equals or superiors, or those who have the power to withhold it; it is opposed to disapprobation: _concurrence_ is given by equals; it is opposed to opposition or rejection. 

####assert 
**ASSERT, MAINTAIN, VINDICATE**  
_Assert_ (see [affirm](entry://affirm)). _Maintain_, in French _maintenir_, from the Latin _manus_ and _teneo_, signifies to hold by the hand — that is, closely and firmly. _Vindicate_, in Latin _vindicatus_, participle of _vindico (vin_, a root signifying to wish, to claim, allied to _venerate, Venus_, etc., and _dicere)_, signifies to express a wish or claim for ourselves or others.  
To _assert_ is to declare a thing as our own; to _maintain_ is to abide by what we have so declared; to _vindicate_ is to stand up for that which concerns ourselves or others. We _assert_ anything to be true; we _maintain_ it by adducing proofs, facts, or arguments; we _vindir cate_ our own conduct or that of another when it is called in question. We assert boldly or impudently; we _maintain_ steadily or obstinately; we _vindicate_ resolutely or insolently. A right or claim is _asserted_ which is avowed to belong to any one; it is _maintained_ when attempts are made to prove its justice or regain its possession; the cause of the _asserter_ or _maintainer_ is _vindicated_ by another. Innocence is _asserted_ by a positive declaration; it is _maintained_ by repeated _assertions_ and the support of testimony; it is _vindicated_ through the interference of another. The most guilty persons do not hesitate to _assert_ their innocence with the hope of inspiring credit; and some will persist in _maintaining_ it even after their guilt has been pronounced; but the really innocent man will never want a friend to _vindicate_ him when his honor or his reputation is at stake. _Assertions_ which are made hastily and inconsiderately are seldom long _maintained_ without exposing a person to ridicule; those who attempt to _vindicate_ a bad cause expose themselves to as much reproach as if the cause were their own.

####assignee 
**ASSIGNEE, ADMINISTRATOR.**  
_Assignee_, in French _assigné_, from the Latin _assigno (ad_, to, and _signum_, seal), signifies one to whom something is formally given over, either in trust or for his own use and enjoyment. An _assignee in deed_ is one appointed by a person; an _assignee in law_ is one appointed by a court or other competent authority; an _assignee in bankruptcy_ is one to whom a bankrupt's estate is assigned and in whom it is vested for the benefit of his creditors.  
The last is the most familiar application of the term. In his capacity as an _administrator_ of another person's property (from Latin _ad_ and _ministrare_, to serve, _administer_ signifying public service applied in this case to a specific function) an _assignee_, after accepting the trust, is not at liberty to assign the property back again to the assignor. It is his duty to act as a faithful trustee for all concerned. He is to take immediate possession of all the property and effects and valuable interests of every kind of the insolvent, and demand and take any necessary steps to collect all outstanding debts. If he sells property of the insolvent he cannot buy it himself. Acting in the discharge of the ordinary duties of an administrator, an _assignee_ is personally liable only for want of ordinary skill and care. See _administer_ under MINISTER for further definition of the function of _administrator_ in general. 

####assimilable 
**ASSIMILABLE, ABSORBABLE, CONFORMABLE, CONVERTIBLE.**  
_Assimilable_, in French the same form, from _assimilate_, derived from _ad_ and _similis_, to make like, signifies that which is capable of being made like another thing, or changed into its own substance. As an adjective, it implies that which may be made in some particulars to resemble another thing; and as a substantive, that which is capable of being so changed.  
In the sense of mixing together, or merging, either of persons or substances, we have the main act of bringing some one or some thing into conformity or agreement with other persons or things, of converting, changing, or incorporating some one or some thing with others. A substance may be readily _absorbable_ (from _ab_ and _sorbere_, to sup up, Greek _ροφέειν)_ by another when the first will be so _conformable_ to the second that both become one substance, and each of the two separately is _convertible_ into a single substance as if individually homogeneous.  
Persons of like temperament and taste are _assimilable_ in association with others of like qualities; citizens are made _conformable_ to the law by penalties for being otherwise; sound securities are readily _convertible_ into cash when desired; certain kinds of food and drink are _assimilable_, or capable of being united or mixed in the stomach without causing distress.  
Hence, in all of these terms we have the sense of a complete and agreeable union of separate things in a single body, because each constituent in itself possesses the qualities of the others.

####associate 
**ASSOCIATE, COMPANION.**  
_Associate_, in Latin _associatus_, participle of _associo_, is derived from _ad_ and _socius_, a companion, literally a follower (allied to _sequor_, I follow). _Companion_, from company (for derivation see [accompany](entry://accompany)), signifies one that bears company.  
_Associates_ are habitually together: _companions_ are only occasionally in company. As our habits are formed from our _associates_, we ought to be particular in our choice of them: as our _companions_ contribute much to our enjoyments, we ought to choose such as are suitable to ourselves. Many men may be admitted as _companions_ who would not altogether be fit as _associates._  
An _associate_ may take part with us in some business, and share with us in the labor: a _companion_ takes part with us in some concern, and shares with us in the pleasure or the pain.  
**ASSOCIATION, SOCIETY, COMPANY, PARTNERSHIP.** — All these terms denote a union of several persons into one body. _Association_ is general, the rest are specific. Whenever we habitually or frequently meet together for some common object, it is an _association. Associations_ are therefore political, religious, commercial, and literary. A _society_ is an _association_ for some specific purpose, moral or religious, civil or political. A _company_ is an _association_ of many for the purpose of trade. A _partnership_ is an _association_ of a few for the same object.  
Whenever _association_ is used in distinction from the others, it denotes that which is partial in its object and temporary in its duration. It is founded on unity of sentiment as well as unity of object; but it is mostly unorganized, and kept together only by the spirit which gives rise to it. A _society_ requires nothing but unity of object which is permanent in its nature; it is well organized, and commonly set on foot to promote the cause of humanity, literature, or religion. No country can boast such numerous and excellent _societies_, whether of a charitable, a religious, or a literary description, as England. _Companies_ are brought together for the purpose of interest, and are dissolved when that object ceases to exist: their duration depends on the contingencies of profit and loss. The South Sea _Company_, which was founded on an idle speculation, was formed for the ruin of many, and dispersed almost as soon as it was formed. _Partnerships_ are altogether of an individual and private nature. As they are without organization and system, they are more precarious than any other _association._ Their duration depends not only on the chances of trade, but the compatibility of individuals to cooperate in a close point of union. They are often begun rashly and end ruinously.  
**ASSOCIATION, COMBINATION.** — _Association_ (see the preceding). _Combination_, from the Latin _combine_, or _con_ and _binus_, signifies tying two into one.  
An _association_ is something less binding than a _combination; associations_ are formed for purposes of convenience; _combinations_ are formed to serve either the interests or passions of men. The word _association_ is therefore always taken in a good or an indifferent sense; _combination_ in an indifferent or bad sense. An _association_ is public; it embraces all classes of men: a _combination_ is often private, and includes only a particular description of persons. _Associations_ are formed for some general purpose; _combinations_ are frequently formed for particular purposes which respect the interest of the few to the injury of many. _Associations_ are formed by good citizens; _combinations_ by discontented mechanics, or low persons in general.  
When used for things, _association_ is a natural action; _combination_ an arbitrary action. Things _associate_ of themselves, but _combinations_ are formed either by design or accident. Nothing will _associate_ but what harmonizes; things the most opposite in their nature may be _combined_ together. We _associate_ persons with places, or events with names; discordant properties are _combined_ in the same body. With the name of one's birthplace are _associated_ pleasurable recollections; virtue and vice are so _combined_ in the same character as to form a contrast. The _association_ of ideas is a remarkable phenomenon of the human mind, but it can never be admitted as solving any difficulty respecting the structure and composition of the soul; the _combination_ of letters forms syllables, and that of syllables forms words.

####assume 
See [affect](entry://affect); [appropriate](entry://appropriate)

####assumption 
**ASSUMPTION, PRESUMPTION, ARROGANCE.**  
_Assumption_, the act of assuming (see [appropriate](entry://appropriate)). _Presumption_, from presume, in Latin _prœsumo_, from _prœ_, before, and _sumo_, to take, signifies to take beforehand, to take for granted. _Arrogance_ (see [appropriate](entry://appropriate)).  
_Assumption_ is a person's taking upon himself to act a part which does not belong to him. _Presumption_ is the taking a place which does not belong to him. _Assumption_ has to do with one's general conduct; _presumption_ relates to matters of right and precedence. A person may be guilty of _assumption_ by giving commands when he ought to receive them, or by speaking when he ought to be silent: he is guilty of _presumption_ in taking a seat which is not fit for him. _Assumption_ arises from self-conceit and self-sufficiency, _presumption_ from self-importance. _Assumption_ and _presumption_ both denote a taking to one's self merely, _arrogance_ claiming from others. A person is guilty of _assumption_ and _presumption_ for his own gratification only, without any direct intentional offence to others; but a man cannot be _arrogant_, be guilty of _arrogance_, without direct offence to others. The arrogant man exacts deference and homage from others; his demands are as extravagant as his mode of making them is offensive. Children are apt to be _assuming_, low people to be _presuming;_ persons among the higher orders, inflated with pride and bad passions, are apt to be _arrogant._

####assurance 
**ASSURANCE, CONFIDENCE.**  
_Assurance_ implies either the act of making another sure (see [affirm](entry://affirm)), or of being sure one's self. _Confidence_ implies simply the act of the mind in _confiding_, which is equivalent to a feeling.  
_Assurance_, as an action, is to _confidence_ as the means to the end. We give a person an _assurance_ in order to inspire him with _confidence. Assurance_ and _confidence_, as a sentiment in ourselves, may respect either that which is external of us, or that which belongs to ourselves; in the first case they are both taken in an indifferent sense: but the feeling of _assurance_ is much stronger than that of _confidence_, and applies to objects that interest the feelings; whereas _confidence_ applies only to such objects as exercise the understanding: thus we have an _assurance_ of a life to come; an _assurance_ of a blessed immortality: we have a _confidence_ in a person's integrity.  
As respects ourselves exclusively, _assurance_ is employed to designate either an occasional feeling or a habit of the mind; _confidence_, an occasional feeling mostly; _assurance_, therefore, in this sense, may be used indifferently, but in general it has a bad acceptation: _confidence_ has an indifferent or a good sense.  
_Assurance_ is a self-possession of the mind, arising from the conviction that all in ourselves is right; _confidence_ is that self-possession only in particular cases, and grounded on the reliance we have in our abilities or our character. The man of _assurance_ never loses himself under any circumstances, however trying; he is calm and easy when another is abashed and confounded: the man who has _confidence_ will generally have it in cases that warrant him to trust to himself. A liar utters falsehoods with an air of _assurance_, in order the more effectually to gain belief; conscious innocence enables a person to speak with _confidence_ when interrogated. _Assurance_ shows itself in the behavior, _confidence_ in the conduct. Young people are apt to assert everything with a tone of _assurance;_ no man should undertake anything without a _confidence_ in himself.  
**ASSURANCE, IMPUDENCE.** — _Assurance_ (see above). _Impudence_ literally implies shamelessness, from _in_, a negative prefix, and _pudere_, to feel shame. They are so closely allied to each other that _assurance_ is distinguished from _impudence_ more in the manner than the spirit; for _impudence_ has a grossness attached to it which does not belong to _assurance._ Vulgar people are _impudent_, because they have _assurance_ to break through all the forms of society; but those who are more cultivated will have their _assurance_ controlled by its decencies and refinements.

####astronomy 
**ASTRONOMY, ASTROLOGY.**  
_Astronomy_ is compounded of the Greek _άστρον_, cognate with English _star_, and _νόμος_, law, and signifies the laws of the stars, or a knowledge of their laws. _Astrology_, from _άδτρον_ and γόλος, signifies a reasoning on the stars.  
The _astronomer_ studies the course and movement of the stars; the _astrologer_ reasons on their influence. The former observes the state of the heavens, marks the order of time, the eclipses, and the revolutions which arise out of the established laws of motion in the immense universe: the latter predicts events, draws horoscopes, and announces all the vicissitudes of rain and snow, heat and cold, etc. The _astronomer_ calculates and seldom errs, as his calculations are built on fixed rules and actual observations; the _astrologer_ deals in conjectures, and his imagination often deceives him. The _astronomer_ explains what he knows, and merits the esteem of the learned; the _astrologer_ hazards what he thinks, and seeks to please. 

####asylum 
**ASYLUM, REFUGE, SHELTER, RETREAT.**  
_Asylum_, in Latin _asylum_, in Greek àδυλόv__, compounded of _a_, privative, and _σύλη_, plunder, signifies a place exempt from plunder. _Refuge_, in Latin _refugium_, from _refugio_, to fly away, signifies the place one may fly away to. _Shelter_ is a corruption of Middle English _sheld-trume_, Anglo-Saxon _scild-truma_, shield-troop, a band of armed men protecting something, and hence a protection in general. _Retreat_, in French _retraite_, Latin _retractus_, from _retraho_, or _re_ and _traho_, to draw back, signifies the place that is situated behind or in the background. _Asylum, refuge_, and _shelter_ all denote a place of safety; but the former is fixed, the two latter are occasional: the _retreat_ is a place of tranquillity rather than of safety. An _asylum_ is chosen by him who has no home, a _refuge_ by him who is apprehensive of danger: the French emigrants found a _refuge_ in England, but very few will make it an _asylum._ The inclemencies of the weather make us seek a _shelter._ The fatigues and toils of life make us seek a _retreat._ It is the part of a Christian to afford an _asylum_ to the helpless orphan and widow. The terrified passenger takes _refuge_ in the first house he comes to, when assailed by an evil-disposed mob. The vessel shattered in a storm takes _shelter_ in the nearest haven. The man of business, wearied with the anxieties and cares of the world, disengages himself from the whole, and seeks a _retreat_ suited to his circumstances. 

####atomic 
**ATOMIC, INAPPEECIABLE, MINUTE, SMALL.**  
_Atomic_, in French _atomique_, is in English a compound of _atom_ and the suffix _ic; atom_, Latin _atomus_, is derived from Greek _άτοπος, à_, a negative prefix, and τέμνειν__, to cut, and signifies that which cannot be cut, a particle of matter which cannot be made smaller. _Inappreciable_ is compounded of _in_, a negative prefix, and _ad_ and _pretium_, price, and signifies something too small to evaluate, too small to notice at all. _Minute_ is derived from the past participle of _minuere_, to make small, whence _minor diminish_, etc., are also derived. _Small_ is a Teutonic word meaning in most Germanic languages what it means in English.  
Of these terms _atomic_ is the most absolute and emphatic, and _small_ the least so. _Small_ is used relatively. We speak of a _small_ man or a _small_ army, though the man is gigantic compared with a mosquito, and the army may be many times the size of groups of people which at other times we call large. We mean that the man is _small_ compared with other men, etc. The use of _small_ is generally influenced by some specific standard of comparison. _Minute_ suggests extreme smallness, but is not so absolute a term as _atomic._ A _minute_ object is small compared with most of the things that we know, but it may nevertheless contain many atoms. _Inappreciable_ is a relative term, but it differs from _small_ in emphasizing the relation of the object to the mind perceiving it. While the degree of smallness indicated in the word _inappreciable_ may vary with the circumstances, the fluctuation is not so great as in the word _small_, because the capacity of the mind to notice and appreciate remains fairly stable, and hence _inappreciable_ has much the same meaning for one person as for another. 

####atone 
**ATONE, EXPIATE.**  
_Atone_, or _at one_, signifies to be at peace or good friends. _Expiate_, in Latin _expiatus_, participle of _expio_, compounded of _ex_ and _pio_, signifies to put out or cancel by an act of piety.  
Both these terms express a satisfaction for an offence; but _atone_ is general, _expiate_ is particular. We may _atone_ for a fault by any species of suffering; we _expiate_ a crime only by suffering a legal punishment. A woman often sufficiently _atones_ for her violation of chastity by the misery she brings on herself; there are too many unfortunate wretches in England who _expiate_ their crimes on the gallows.  
Neither _atonement_ nor _expiation_ always necessarily requires punishment or even suffering from the offender. The nature of the _atonement_ depends on the nature of the offence or will of the individual who is offended; _expiations_ are frequently made by means of performing certain religious rites or acts of piety. Offences between man and man are sometimes _atoned_ for by an acknowledgment of error; but offences toward God require an _expiatory_ sacrifice, which our Saviour has been pleased to make of himself, that we, through him, might become partakers of eternal life. _Expiation_, therefore, in the religious sense, is to _atonement_ as the means to the end: _atonement_ is often obtained by an _expiation_, but there may be _expiations_ where there is no _atonement._

####attache 
**ATTACHE, ASSISTANT, INFORMANT.**  
_Attaché_, though a purely French term, has been adopted in the vocabulary of practically all modern nations, implying, literally, a person attached to a thing or other person, and, specifically, one attached to an embassy. In the diplomatic world, an _attaché_ is much less than an ambassador, and much more than a routine clerk. One may be an ordinary _attaché_ who gathers information for his superior, a _military attaché_, who is usually an officer in the army of his own country, or a _naval attaché_, one holding a naval office at home.  
_Assistant_ (see [help](entry://help)) and _informant_ (see [inform](entry://inform)) are more general terms which may be specialized to refer to the functions of an _attaché_ in _assisting_ the work of his superiors, and _informing_ them concerning conditions in the country where he serves.  
In peaceful days the post of an _attaché_ is a very pleasant one: in wartimes it may be a very difficult and unpleasant one, as, in carrying out instructions of his superior and secretly gaining some desired information, an _attaché_ may become seriously involved with the authorities of the country to which he is assigned, though immune from arrest or other legal proceeding. In December, 1915, the United States Government demanded the recall of the military and naval _attachés_ of the German embassy at Washington, because of their activities in fomenting local troubles during the European war. Both officers declared they had acted under orders, as they were bound to do. 

####attached 
See [on](entry://on)

####attachment 
**ATTACHMENT, AFFECTION, INCLINATION.**  
_Attachment_ respects persons and things: _affection_ regards persons only: _inclination_, denoting the act of inclining, has respect to things mostly, but may be applied to objects generally.  
_Attachment_, as it regards persons, is not so powerful or solid as _affection._ Children are _attached_ to those who will minister to their gratifications; they have an _affection_ for their nearest and dearest relatives. _Attachment_ is sometimes a tender sentiment between persons of different sexes; _affection_ is an affair of the heart without distinction of sex. The passing _attachments_ of young people are seldom entitled to serious notice; although sometimes they may ripen by a long intercourse into a laudable and steady _affection._ Nothing is so delightful as to see _affection_ among brothers and sisters.  
_Attachment_ is a something more powerful and positive than _inclination;_ the latter is a rising sentiment, a mere leaning of the mind toward an object; the former is a feeling already fixed so as to create a tie; an _attachment_ is formed, an _inclination_ arises in the mind of itself.  
In respect to things, _attachment_ and _inclination_ admit of a similar distinction. We strive to obtain that to which we are _attached_, but a simple _inclination_ rarely produces any effort for possession. Little minds are always betraying their _attachment_ to trifles. It is the character of indifference not to show an _inclination_ to anything. Interest, similarity of character, or habit gives rise to _attachment;_ a natural warmth of temper gives birth to various _inclinations._ Suppress the first _inclination_ to gaming, lest it grow into an _attachment._

####attack 
**ATTACK, ASSAIL, ASSAULT, ENCOUNTER.**  
_Attack_ is a doublet of _attach_, derived from the same original word. (See [adhere](entry://adhere)) _Assail, assault_, in French _assaillir_, Latin _assilio, assaltum_, compounded of _ad_ and _salio_, signify to leap upon. _Encounter_, in Old French _encontrer_, compounded of _en_ or _in_ and _contre_, in Latin _contra_, against, signifies to run or come against.  
_Attack_ is the generic, the rest are specific terms. To _attack_ is to make an approach in order to do some violence to the person; to _assail_ or _assault_ is to make a sudden and vehement _attack;_ to _encounter_ is to meet the _attack_ of another. One _attacks_ by simply offering violence without necessarily producing an effect; one _assails_ by means of missile weapons; one _assaults_ by direct personal violence; one _encounters_ by opposing violence to violence. Men and animals _attack_ or _encounter;_ men only, in the literal sense, _assail_ or _assault._ Animals _attack_ each other with the weapons nature has bestowed upon them: those who provoke a multitude may expect to have their houses or windows assailed with stones, and their persons _assaulted; it_ is ridiculous to attempt to _encounter_ those who are superior in strength and prowess.  
They are all used figuratively. Men _attack_ with reproaches or censures; they _assail_ with abuse; they are _assaulted by_ temptations; they _encounter_ opposition and difficulties. A fever _attacks;_ horrid shrieks _assail_ the ear; dangers are _encountered._ The reputations of men in public life are often wantonly _attacked;_ they are _assailed_ in every direction by the murmurs and complaints of the discontented; they often _encounter_ the obstacles which party spirit throws in the way, without reaping any solid advantage to themselves.  
**ATTACK, ASSAULT, ENCOUNTER, ONSET, CHARGE.** — _Attack, assault, encounter_, denote the act of _attacking, assaulting, encountering. Onset_ signifies a setting on or to, a commencing. _Charge_ (see [accuse](entry://accuse)) signifies pressing upon.  
An _attack_ and _assault_ may be made upon an unresisting object; _encounter, onset_, and _charge_ require at least two opposing parties. An _attack_ may be slight or indirect; an _assault_ must always be direct, and mostly vigorous. An _attack_ upon a town need not be attended with any injury to the walls or inhabitants; but an _assault_ is commonly conducted so as to effect its capture. _Attacks_ are made by robbers upon the person or property of another; _assaults_ upon the person only. An_ encounter_ generally respects an informal casual meeting between single individuals; _onset_ and _charge_ a regular _attack_ between contending armies: _onset_ is employed for the commencement of the battle; _charge_ for an _attack_ from a particular quarter. When knight-errantry was in vogue, _encounters_ were perpetually taking place between the knights, which were sometimes fierce and bloody. Armies that make impetuous _onsets_ are not always prepared to withstand a continued _attack_ with perseverance and steadiness. A furious and well-directed _charge_ from the cavalry will sometimes decide the fortune of the day.

####attain

####attaint 
**ATTAINT, CORRUPT, STAIN, TAINT.**  
_Attaint_ and _taint_ are commonly confused in the popular mind, but, etymologically they have nothing to do with each other. _Attaint_ is the past participle of the verb _attain_, used in a technical sense in law. To _attain_ meant to _convict_, to attain the end sought in a legal trial.  
Under an act of the British parliament known as the _Act of Attainder_, an attainder is a decree involving the loss of civil rights and estate of one guilty of the crime of treason or other capital offence, and a _Bill of Attainder is_ the designation of the foregoing act. Hence, in the popular mind, it was natural that _attaint_ should be associated with _taint_ (from Latin _tingere_, to color, whence _tint_ is derived), and with _stain_ (from _distingere_, literally to discolor), because the conviction by the court involved disgrace, or the _staining_ and _tainting_ of the character and reputation.  
The Constitution of the United States declares that (1) "No bill of _attainder_ or _ex post facto_ laws shall be passed"; (2) "No state shall... pass any bill of _attainder, ex post facto_ law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts"; and (3) "... but no _attainder_ of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person _attained. "  
Corrupt_ , as used in the phrase _corruption of blood_, implies that the blood of a person who has been _attainted_ or is under an _attainder_ has been legally corrupted, _tainted_, or _stained_ by the disgrace. In old English law a jury that brought in a false verdict was liable to be _attainted_ by another jury, and in case of conviction the members were pronounced infamous, their goods were forfeited, their families turned out of doors, and their houses razed. The later practice set aside verdicts and granted new trials, and an act of parliament put an end to the system of _attaints._

####attempt 
**ATTEMPT, TRIAL, ENDEAVOR, EFFORT, ESSAY.**  
_Attempt_, in French _attenter_, Latin _attenta_, from _ad_ and _tento_, signifies to _try_ at a thing. _Trial_, from French _trier, try_, comes from Late Latin _tritare_, to pound small; thence developing the meaning of culling, picking out. _Endeavor_, compounded of _en_ and the French _devoir_, to owe, signifies to try according to one's duty. _Effort_, from Latin _ex_ and _fortem_ (accusative), strength, signifies the putting forth of strength. _Essay_ comes from Latin _exagium_, a trial of weight, from _ex_, out, and _agere_, to drive or move; it is the same word as _assay._  
To _attempt_ is to set about a thing with a view of effecting it; to _try_ is to set about a thing with a view of seeing the result. An _attempt_ respects the action with its object; a _trial_ is the exercise of power. We always act when we _attempt:_ we use the senses and the understanding when we _try._ We _attempt_ by _trying_, but we may _try_ without _attempting;_ when a thief _attempts_ to break into a house, he first _tries_ the locks and fastenings, to see where he can most easily gain admittance. Men _attempt_ to remove evils; they _try_ experiments. _Attempts_ are perpetually made by quacks to recommend some scheme of their own to the notice of the public, which are often nothing more than _trials_ of skill to see who can most effectually impose on the credulity of mankind. Spirited people make _attempts;_ persevering people make _trials;_ players _attempt_ to perform different parts, and _try_ to gain applause. An _endeavor_ is a continued _attempt. Attempts_ may be fruitless; _trials may_ be vain; _endeavors_, though unavailing, may be well meant. Many _attempts_ are made which exceed the abilities of the _attempter; attempts_ at imitation expose the imitator to ridicule when they do not succeed; t_rials_ are made in matters of speculation, the results of which are uncertain; _endeavors_ are made in the moral concerns of life. People _attempt_ to write books; they _try_ various methods; and _endeavor_ to obtain a livelihood.  
An _effort_ is to an _attempt_ as a means to an end; it is the act of calling forth those powers which are required in an _attempt._ Great _attempts_ frequently require great _efforts_, either of body or mind.  
An _essay is_ an imperfect _attempt_, or _attempt_ to do something which cannot be done without difficulty. It is applied either to corporeal or intellectual matters.  
Whence treatises which serve as _attempts_ to illustrate any point in morals are termed _essays._  
**ATTEMPT, UNDERTAKING, ENTERPRISE.** — _Attempt_ signifies the thing _attempted. Undertaking_, from _undertake_, or take -in hand, signifies the thing taken in hand. _Enterprise_, from the Old French _enterpris_, participle of _entreprendre_, to undertake, has the same original sense.  
The idea of something set about to be completed is common to all these terms. An _attempt_ is less complicated than an _undertaking;_ and that less arduous than an _enterprise. Attempts_ are the common exertions of power for obtaining an object; an _undertaking_ involves in it many parts and particulars which require thought and judgment: an _enterprise_ has more that is hazardous and dangerous in it; it requires resolution. _Attempts_ are frequently made on the lives and property of individuals; _undertakings_ are formed for private purposes; _enterprises_ are commenced for some great national object. Nothing can be effected without making the _attempt; attempts_ are therefore often idle and unsuccessful when they are made by persons of little discretion, who are eager to do something without knowing how to direct their powers: _undertakings_ are of a more serious nature, and involve a man's serious interests; if begun without adequate means of bringing them to a conclusion, they too frequently bring ruin by their failure on those who are concerned in them: _enterprises_ require personal sacrifices rather than those of interest; he who does not combine great resolution and perseverance with considerable bodily powers will be ill-fitted to take part in grand _enterprises._

####attend 
**ATTEND, MIND, REGARD, HEED, NOTICE.**  
_Attend_, in French _attendre_, Latin _attende_, compounded of _ad_ and _tendere_, to stretch, signifies to stretch or bend the mind to a thing. _Mind_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _munan_, to think. _Regard_, in French _regarder_, compounded of _re_ and _garder_, a word of German origin meaning to watch over, signifies to look upon again or with attention. _Heed_, Anglo-Saxon _hedan_, is allied to German _hüten_, to guard. _Notice_, from the Latin _notitia_, knowledge, signifies to bring to the knowledge of, or bring to one's mind.  
The idea of fixing the mind on an object is common to all these terms. As this is the characteristic of _attention, attend_ is the generic, the rest are specific terms. We _attend_ in _minding, regarding, heeding_, and _noticing_, and also in many cases in which these words are not employed. To _mind_ is to _attend to_ a thing, so that it may not be forgotten; to _regard is_ to look on a thing as of importance; to _heed_ is to _attend to_ a thing from a principle of caution; to _notice_ is to think on that which strikes the senses. We _attend to_ a speaker when we hear and understand his words; we _mind_ what is said when we bear it in mind; we _regard_ what is said by dwelling and reflecting on it; _heed_ is given to whatever awakens a sense of danger; _notice_ is taken of what passes outwardly. Children should always _attend_ when spoken to, and _mind_ what is said to them; they should _regard_ the counsels of their parents, so as to make them the rule of their conduct, and _heed_ their warnings so as to avoid the evil; they should _notice_ what passes before them, so as to apply it to some useful purpose. It is a part of politeness to _attend_ to every minute circumstance which affects the comfort and convenience of those with whom we associate: men who are actuated by any passion seldom pay any _regard_ to the dictates of conscience, nor _heed_ the unfavorable impressions which their conduct makes on others, for in fact they seldom think what is said of them to be worth their _notice._

**ATTEND, WAIT ON.** — _Attend_ is here employed in the improper sense for the devotion of the person to an object. To _wait on_ is the same as to wait for the wishes of another. They may be either partial and temporary acts or permanent acts; in either case _attend_ has a higher signification than _wait on. Attendance_ is for the purpose of discharging some duty, as a physician _attends_ his patient; a member _attends_ in parliament; _waiting on_ is either a matter of courtesy between equals, as one gentleman _waits on_ another to whom he wishes to show a mark of respect; or a matter of business, as a tradesman _waits on_ his customers to take orders.  
In the sense of being permanently about the person of any one, to _attend_ is to bear company or be in readiness to serve; to _wait on_ is actually to perform some service. A nurse _attends_ a patient in order to afford him assistance as occasion requires; the servant _waits on_ him to perform the menial duties. _Attendants_ about the great are always near the person; but men and women in _waiting_ are always at call. People of rank and fashion have a crowd of _attendants;_ those of the middle classes have only those who _wait on_ them.  
**ATTEND, HEARKEN, LISTEN.** — _Attend_ (see above). _Hearken_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _heorcnian_, to listen to, but is not directly allied to hear. _Listen_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _hlystan_, to hear.  
_Attend_ is a mental action; _hearken_, both corporeal and mental; _listen_ simply corporeal. To _attend_ is to have the mind engaged on what we hear; to _hearken_ and _listen_ are to strive to hear. People _attend_ when they are addressed; they _hearken_ to what is said by others; they _listen_ to what passes between others. It is always proper to _attend_, and mostly of importance to _hearken_, but frequently improper to _listen._ The mind that is occupied with another object cannot _attend;_ we are not disposed to _hearken_ when the thing does not appear interesting; curiosity often impels to _listening_ to what does not concern the _listener. Listen_ is sometimes used figuratively in the sense of _hearkening_ with the desire to profit by it; it is necessary at all times to _listen_ to the dictates of reason.  
**ATTENTION, APPLICATION, STUDY.** — These terms indicate a direction of the thoughts to an object, but differing in the degree of steadiness and force. _Attention_ marks the simple bending of the mind. _Application_ (see [address](entry://address)) marks an envelopment or engagement of the powers; a bringing them into a state of close contact. _Study_, from the Latin _studeo_, to desire eagerly, marks a degree of _application_ that arises from a strong desire of attaining the object.  
_Attention_ is the first requisite for making a progress in the acquirement of knowledge; it may be given in various degrees, and it rewards according to the proportion in which it is given: a divided _attention_ is, however, more hurtful than otherwise; it retards the progress of the learner, while it injures his mind by improper exercise. _Application_ is requisite for the attainment of perfection in any pursuit; it cannot be partial or variable, like _attention;_ it must be the constant exercise of power or the regular and uniform use of means for the attainment of an end: youth is the period for _application_, when the powers of body and mind are in full vigor; no degree of it in afterlife will supply its deficiency in younger years. _Study_ is that species of _application_ which is most purely intellectual in its nature; it is the exercise of the mind for itself and in itself, its native effort to arrive at maturity; it embraces both _attention_ and _application._ The student _attends_ to all he hears and sees; _applies_ what he has learned to the acquirement of what he wishes to learn, and digests the whole by the exercise of reflection: as nothing is thoroughly understood or properly reduced to practice without _study_, the professional man must choose this road in order to reach the summit of excellence.

**ATTENTIVE, CAREFUL.** — _Attentive_ marks a readiness to attend. _Careful_ signifies full of care (see [care](entry://care), SOLICITUDE).  
These epithets denote a fixedness of mind: we are _attentive_ in order to understand and improve: we are _careful_ to avoid mistakes. An _attentive_ scholar profits by what is told him in learning his task: a _careful_ scholar performs his exercises correctly. _Attention_ respects matters of judgment; _care_ relates to mechanical action: we listen _attentively;_ we read or write _carefully._ A servant must be _attentive_ to the orders that are given him, and _careful_ not to injure his master's property. A translator must be _attentive;_ a transcriber _careful._ A tradesman ought to be _attentive_ to the wishes of his customers, and _careful_ in keeping his accounts.

####attract 
**ATTRACT, ALLURE, INVITE, ENGAGE.**  
_Attract_, in Latin _attractum_, participle of _attraho_, compounded of _ad_, to, and _traho_, signifies to draw toward. _Allure_ (see [allure](entry://allure)). _Invite_, in French _inviter_, Latin _invitare_, means to ask or request, the stem being allied to _vitus_ in _invitas_, unwilling. _Engage_, compounded of _en_ or. _in_ and the French _gage_, a pledge (from a Teutonic root), signifies to bind as by a pledge.  
That is _attractive_ which draws the thoughts toward itself; that is _alluring_ which awakens desire; that is _inviting_ which offers persuasion; that is _engaging_ which takes possession of the mind. The attention is _attracted;_ the senses are _allured;_ the understanding is _invited;_ the whole mind is _engaged._ A particular sound _attracts_ the ear; the prospect of gratification _allures;_ we are _invited_ by the advantages which offer; we are _engaged_ by those which, already accrue. The person of a female is _attractive;_ female beauty involuntarily draws all eyes toward itself; it awakens admiration: the pleasures of society are _alluring;_ they create in the receiver an eager desire for still further enjoyment; but when too eagerly pursued they vanish in the pursuit, and leave the mind a prey to listless uneasiness: fine weather is _inviting;_ it seems to persuade the reluctant to partake of its refreshments: the manners of a person are _engaging;_ they not only occupy the attention, but they lay hold of the affections.  
**ATTRACTIONS, ALLUREMENTS, CHARMS.** — _Attraction_ signifies the thing that attracts. _Allurement_ signifies the thing that allures. _Charm_, from the Latin _carmen_, a verse, signifies whatever acts by an irresistible influence, like poetry.  
Besides the synonymous idea which distinguishes these words, they are remarkable for the common property of being used only in the plural when denoting the thing that _attracts, allures_, and _charms_, as applied to female endowments or the influence of persons on the heart: it seems that in _attractions_ there is something natural; in _allurements_ something artificial; in _charms_ something moral and intellectual. _Attractions_ and _charms_ are always taken in a good sense; _allurements_ mostly in a bad sense: _attractions_ lead or draw; _allurements_ win or entice; _charms_ seduce or captivate. The human heart is always exposed to the power of female _attractions;_ it is guarded with difficulty against the _allurements_ of a coquette; it is incapable of resisting the united _charms_ of body and mind.  
When applied to other objects, an _attraction_ springs from something remarkable and striking; it lies in the exterior aspect, and awakens an interest toward itself; a _charm_ acts by a secret, all-powerful, and irresistible impulse on the soul; it springs from an accordance of the object with the affections of the heart; it takes hold of the imagination, and awakens an enthusiasm peculiar to itself: an _allurement_ acts on the senses; it flatters the passions; it enslaves the imagination. The metropolis has its _attractions_ for the gay; music has its _charms_ for every one; fashionable society has too many _allurements_ for youth, which are not easily withstood. 

####attribute 
See [ascribe](entry://ascribe); [quality](entry://quality)

####audacity 
**AUDACITY, EFFRONTERY, HARDIHOOD or HARDINESS, BOLDNESS.**  
_Audacity_, from _audacious_, in French _audacieux_, Latin _audax_ and _audere_, to dare, signifies literally the quality of daring. _Effrontery_, through French from _ef_, for _ex_, out, and _frons_, a face, signifies putting out the forehead. _Hardihood_ or _hardiness_, from _hardy_ or _hard_, signifies a capacity to endure or stand the brunt of difficulties, opposition, or shame. _Bold_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _bald._  
The idea of disregarding what others regard is common to all these terms.  
_Audacity_ expresses more than _effrontery;_ the first has something of vehemence, of defiance in it; the latter that of cool unconcern: _hardihood_ expresses less than _boldness;_ the first has more of determination, and the second more of spirit and enterprise. _Audacity_ and _effrontery_ are always taken in a bad sense; _hardihood_, in an indifferent, if not a bad sense; _boldness_, in a good, bad, or indifferent sense. _Audacity_ marks haughtiness and temerity; effrontery the want of all modesty, a total shamelessness; _hardihood_ indicates a firm resolution to meet consequences; _boldness_, a spirit and courage to commence action. An _audacious_ man speaks with a lofty tone, without respect and without reflection; his haughty demeanor makes him forget what is due to his superiors. _Effrontery_ discovers itself by an insolent air, a total unconcern for the opinions of those present, and a disregard of all the forms of civil society. A _hardy_ man speaks with a resolute tone, which seems to brave the utmost evil that can result from what he says. A _bold_ man speaks without reserve, undaunted by the quality, rank, or haughtiness of those whom he addresses. It requires _audacity_ to assert false claims or vindicate a lawless conduct in the presence of accusers and judges; it requires _effrontery_ to ask a favor of the man whom one has basely injured, or to assume a placid, unconcerned air in the presence of those by whom one has been convicted of flagrant atrocities; it requires _hardihood_ to assert as a positive fact what is dubious, _boldness_ to maintain the truth in spite of every danger with which one is threatened. 

####augmentation

####augur 
**AUGUR, PRESAGE, FOREBODE, BETOKEN, PORTEND.**  
_Augur_, in French _augurer_, Latin _augurium_, comes from _avis_, a bird, as an _augury_ was originally, and at all times principally, drawn from the song, the flight, or other actions of birds. _Presage_, in French _présage_, from the Latin _prœ_ and _sagio_, to be instinctively wise, signifies to be thus wise about what is to come. _Forebode_ is compounded of _fore_ and the Anglo-Saxon _bodian_, to declare, signifying to pronounce on futurity. _Betoken_ signifies to serve as a token, from Anglo-Saxon _tacen_ (from a root found also in _teach). Portend_, in Latin _portendo_, compounded of _por_, for, and _tendo_, signifies to set or show forth.  
_Augur_ signifies either to serve or make use of as an _augury;_ to _forebode_, and _presage_, is to form a conclusion in one's own mind: to _betoken_ or _portend_ is to serve as a sign. Persons or things _augur;_ persons only _forebode_ or _presage;_ things only _betoken_ or _portend. Auguring_ is a calculation of some future event, in which the imagination seems to be as much concerned as the understanding: _presaging_ is rather a conclusion or deduction of what may be from what it is; it lies in the understanding more than in the imagination: _foreboding_ lies altogether in the imagination. Things are said to _betoken_ which present natural signs; those are said to _portend_ which present extraordinary or supernatural signs. It _augurs_ ill for the prosperity of a country or a state when its wealth has increased so as to take away the ordinary stimulus to industry and to introduce an inordinate love of pleasure. We _presage_ the future greatness of a man from the indications which he gives of possessing an elevated, character. A distempered mind is apt to _forebode_ every ill from the most trivial circumstances. We see with pleasure those actions in a child which _betoken_ an ingenuous temper: a mariner sees with pain the darkness of the sky which _portends_ a storm; the moralist _augurs_ no good to the morals of a nation from the lax discipline which prevails in the education of youth; he _presages_ the loss of independence to the minds of men in whom proper principles of subordination have not been early engendered. Men sometimes _forebode_ the misfortunes which happen to them, but they oftener _forebode_ evils which never come.

####auspicious 
**AUSPICIOUS, PROPITIOUS.**  
_Auspicious_, from the Latin _auspicium_ and _auspex_, compounded of _avis_ and _spicio_, to behold, signifies favorable according to the inspection of birds. _Propitious_ is probably also a term in augury, meaning "flying forward, " from _pro_, forward, and _petere_, to seek, originally to fly.  
_Auspicious_ is said only of things; _propitious_ is said only of persons or things personified. Those things are _auspicious_ which are casual or only indicative of good; persons are _propitious_ to the wishes of others who listen to their requests and contribute to their satisfaction. A journey is undertaken under _auspicious_ circumstances where everything incidental, as weather, society, and the like, bid fair to afford pleasure; it is undertaken under _propitious_ circumstances when everything favors the attainment of the object for which it was begun. Whoever has any request to make ought to seize the _auspicious_ moment when the person of whom it is asked is in a pleasant frame of mind; a poet in his invocation requests the muse to be _propitious_ to him, or the lover conjures his mistress to be _propitious_ to his vows.

####austere 
**AUSTERE, RIGID, SEVERE, RIGOROUS, STERN.**  
For the derivations of _austere, rigid, rigorous_, and _stern_ see [ascetic](entry://ascetic). _Severe_ comes from Latin _severus_, serious, grave.  
_Austere_ applies to ourselves as well as to others; _rigid_ applies to ourselves only; _severe, rigorous, stern_, apply to others only. We are _austere_ in our manner of living; _rigid_ in our mode of thinking; _austere, severe, rigorous_, and _stern_ in our mode of dealing with others. Effeminacy is opposed to _austerity_, pliability to _rigidity._ The _austere_ man mortifies himself; the _rigid_ man binds himself to a rule: the manners of a man are _austere_ when he refuses to take part in any social enjoyments; his probity is _rigid_ — that is, inaccessible to the allurements of gain or the urgency of necessity: an _austere_ life consists not only in the privation of every pleasure, but in the infliction of every pain; _rigid_ justice is unbiased, no less by the fear of loss than by the desire of gain: the present age affords no example of _austerity_, but too many of its opposite extreme, effeminacy: and the _rigidity_ of former times, in modes of thinking, has been succeeded by a culpable laxity.  
_Austere_, when taken with relation to others, is said of the behavior; _severe_ of the conduct: a parent is _austere_ in his looks, his manner, and his words to his child; he is _severe_ in the restraints he imposes and the punishments he inflicts; an _austere_ master speaks but to command, and commands so as to be obeyed; a _severe_ master punishes every fault and punishes in an undue measure; an _austere_ temper is never softened; the countenance of such a one never relaxes into a smile, nor is he pleased to witness smiles: a _severe_ temper is ready to catch at the imperfections of others and to wound the offender: a judge should be a _rigid_ administrator of justice between man and man, and _severe_ in the punishment of offences as occasion requires; but never _austere_ toward those who appear before him; _austerity_ of manner would ill become him who sits as a protector of either the innocent or the injured. _Rigor_ is a species of great s_everity_, namely, in the infliction of punishment: toward enormous offenders, or on particular occasions where an example is requisite, _rigor_ may be adopted, but otherwise it marks a cruel temper. A man is _austere_ in his manners, _severe_ in his remarks, and _rigorous_ in his discipline. _Austerity, rigidity_, and _severity_ may be habitual; _rigor_ and _sternness_ are occasional. _Sternness_ is a species of severity more in manner than in direct action; a commander may issue his commands _sternly_, or a despot may issue his _stern_ decrees.

####autocracy 
**AUTOCRACY, OLIGARCHY, ARISTOCRACY.**  
_Autocracy_ corresponds most nearly to words listed under ABSOLUTE, which see. _Autocracy_, from Greek _αυτός_, self, and _κρατέειν_, to rule, refers to a state in winch absolute power is in the hands of one man or a small group of men. _Oligarchy_ is a form of _autocracy_ in which the power is in the hands of a few — of a council of men or a group of nobles. It is derived from Greek _ολίγος_, few, and _άρχειν_, to rule. An _oligarchy_, therefore, is generally an _autocracy_, but an _autocracy_ is not always an _oligarchy;_ at least nominally it is not, but practically it generally is, because the power even of an absolute monarch really resides in the group of his advisers. An _aristocracy_ is an _oligarchy_ in which the few are also the _best_ men, from Greek _άριστος_, best. While the Greeks held an ideal of a state in which the power was in the hands of the wisest and the noblest, as a matter of fact there was, in practice, little difference between an _aristocracy_ and an _oligarchy_, the "best" men being the self-assertive and the powerful who could get the government into their hands, with special reference to those of noble birth.  
As adjectives _autocratic_ corresponds very nearly to _absolute_ (which see), and has the same synonymes — _despotic, tyrannical_, etc. _Autocratic_ generally has reference to the assertion of the right to hold absolute rule, in action, speech, or manner; _despotic_ and _tyrannical_ to the actual exercise of that self-appointed right to the oppression of another. _Aristocratic_, like _autocratic_, is a more general word than _oligarchical. Oligarchical_ means characteristic of an _oligarch_, one of a small group of autocratic rulers; _aristocratic_ refers in general to the characteristics of men of hereditary importance in a state whose qualities of personality and gifts of fortune entitle them to a position of dignity. It is generally used in a good sense, while _oligarchical_ is somewhat derogatory. 

####automobile 
**AUTOMOBILE, AUTO, CAR, MACHINE, MOTOR.**  
These words do not differ in meaning or application: the only difference is the extent and dignity of their usage as designations for exactly the same thing. _Automobile_ is the regular word; the rest are more or less colloquial substitutes. _Automobile_ is a French word formed by adding Greek _αυτο_, self, to French _mobile_, to indicate a self-moving vehicle, one propelled by its own machinery. _Auto_ is a somewhat inelegant abbreviation usually frowned on in polite society in favor of _car_ or _machine_, general words which have been given this special application. _Motor_, in America, is usually employed as a verb meaning to ride in an _automobile;_ in England, however, _motor-car_ is the common term for _automobile._

####auxiliary 
**AUXILIARY, ANCILLARY, SUBSIDIARY.**  
_Auxiliary_ comes from Latin _auxilium_, help, from _augere_, to increase. _Ancillary_ comes from Latin _ancilla_, a handmaid, and means literally serving in the capacity of a handmaid. _Subsidiary_ comes from Latin _subsidium_, a body of troops in reserve, from Latin _sub_, under, in reserve, and _sedere_, to sit. All these words mean aiding or assisting, and there is very little difference in their application. What there is is mainly that suggested by the derivation. _Auxiliary_ does not suggest the degree of subordination implied in _ancillary_ and _subsidiary. Subsidiary_ and _ancillary_ differ slightly in the relation of the implied help to the person or object to be helped, _ancillary_ suggesting merely subordinate aid, _subsidiary_ aid held in reserve.

####avarice 
See [covetousness](entry://covetousness)

####avaricious 
**AVARICIOUS, MISERLY, PARSIMONIOUS, NIGGARDLY.**  
_Avaricious_, from Latin _avarus_, and _avere_, to desire, signifies desiring money, from a love of it. _Miserly_ signifies like a _miser_, or _miserable_ man; for none are so miserable as the lovers of money. _Parsimonious_, from the Latin _parcere_, to spare or save, signifies, literally, saving. _Niggardly_ is a Scandinavian word signifying stingy.  
The _avaricious_ man and the _miser_ are one and the same character, with this exception, that the _miser_ carries his passion for money to a still greater excess. An _avaricious_ man shows his love of money in his ordinary dealings, but the _miser_ lives upon it, and suffers every privation rather than part with it. An _avaricious_ man may sometimes be indulgent to himself and generous to others; the _miser_ is dead to everything but the treasure which he has amassed. _Parsimonious_ and _niggardly_ are the subordinate characteristics of _avarice._ The _avaricious_ man indulges his passion for money by _parsimony_ — that is, by saving out of himself, or by _niggardly_ ways in his dealings with others. He who spends a farthing on himself where others with the same means spend a shilling does it from _parsimony:_ he who looks to every farthing in the bargains he makes gets the name of a _niggard. Avarice_ sometimes cloaks itself under the name of prudence: it is, as Goldsmith says, often the only virtue which is left a man at the age of seventy-two. The _miser_ is his own greatest enemy, and no man's friend; his ill-gotten wealth is generally a curse to him by whom it is inherited. A man is sometimes rendered _parsimonious_ by circumstances; but he who first saves from necessity too often ends with saving from inclination. The _niggard_ is an object of contempt, and sometimes hatred; every one fears to lose by a man who strives to gain from all. See also [greedy](entry://greedy)

####avenge 
**AVENGE, REVENGE, VINDICATE.**  
_Avenge, revenge_, and _vindicate_ all spring from the same source, namely, the Latin _vindicate_, from _vindex_, a claimant, signifying to pronounce justice or put justice in force.  
The idea common to these terms is that of taking up some one's cause. To _avenge_ is to punish in behalf of another; to _revenge_ is to punish for one's self; to _vindicate_ is to defend another. The wrongs of a person are _avenged_ or _revenged;_ his rights are _vindicated._ The act of _avenging_, though attended with the infliction of pain, is oftentimes an act of humanity, and always an act of justice; none are the sufferers but such as merit it for their oppression; while those are benefited who are dependent for support: this is the act of God Himself, Who always _avenges_ the oppressed who look up to Him for support; and it ought to be the act of all His creatures who are invested with the power of punishing offenders and protecting the helpless. _Revenge_ is the basest of all actions, and the spirit of _revenge_ the most diametrically opposed to the Christian principles of forgiving injuries and returning good for evil; it is gratified only with inflicting pain without any prospect of advantage. _Vindication_ is an act of generosity and humanity; it is the production of good without the infliction of pain: the claims of the widow and orphan call for _vindication_ from those who have the time, talent, or ability to take their cause into their own hands: England can boast of many noble _vindicators_ of the rights of humanity, not excepting those which concern the brute creation. 

####aver 
Pee AFFIRM. 

####averse 
**AVERSE, UNWILLING, BACKWARD, LOATH, RELUCTANT.**  
_Averse_, in Latin _aversus_, participle of _avertere_, compounded of _vertere_, to turn, and _a_, from, signifies the state of having the mind turned from a thing. _Unwilling_ literally signifies not willing. _Backward_ signifies having the will in a _backward_ direction. _Loath_, from Anglo-Saxon _loth_, hateful, hostile, has developed a somewhat milder meaning. _Reluctant_, from the Latin _re_ against, and _luctare_, to struggle, signifies struggling with the will against a thing.  
_Averse_ is positive, it marks an actual sentiment of dislike; _unwilling_ is negative, it marks the absence of the will; _backward_ is a sentiment between the two, it marks a leaning of the will against a thing; _loath_ and _reluctant_ mark strong feelings of _aversion. Aversion_ is an habitual sentiment; _unwillingness_ and _backwardness_ are mostly occasional; _hath_ and _reluctant_ always occasional. _Aversion_ must be conquered; _unwillingness_ must be removed; _backwardness_ must be counteracted or urged forward; _loathing_ and _reluctance_ must be overpowered. One who is _averse_ to study will never have recourse to books; but a child may be _unwilling_ or _backward_ to attend to his lessons from partial motives, which the authority of the parent or master may correct; he who is _loath_ to receive instruction will always remain ignorant; he who is _reluctant_ in doing his duty will always do it as a task. A miser is _averse_ to nothing so much as to parting with his money: he is even _unwilling_ to provide himself with necessaries, but he is not _backward_ in disposing of his money when he has the prospect of getting more; friends are _loath_ to part who have had many years' enjoyment in each other's society; we are _reluctant_ in giving unpleasant advice. Lazy people are _averse_ to labor; those who are not paid are _unwilling_ to work; and those who are paid less than others, are _backward_ in giving their services: every one is _loath_ to give up a favorite pursuit, and when compelled to it by circumstances they do it with _reluctance._

**AVERSION, ANTIPATHY, DISLIKE, HATRED, REPUGNANCE.** — _Aversion_ denotes _the_ quality of being averse. _Antipathy_, in French _antipathie_, Latin _antipathia_, Greek _άντιπάθεια_, compounded of _άντί_, against, and _παθειν_, to suffer, to feel, feeling, signifies here a natural feeling against an object. _Dislike_, compounded of the privative _dis_ and _like_, signifies not to like or be attached to. _Hatred_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _hatian_, to hate. _Repugnance_, in French _répugnance_, Latin _repugnantia_ and _repugnare_, compounded of _re-_, against, and _pugnare_, to fight, signifies the resistance of the feelings to an object.  
_Aversion_ is in its most general sense the generic term to these and many other similar expressions, in which case it is opposed to attachment, the former denoting an alienation of the mind from an object; the latter a knitting or binding of the mind to objects: it has, however, more commonly a partial acceptation, in which it is justly comparable with the above words. The first four are used indifferently for persons and things, the last for things. _Aversion_ and _antipathy_ seem to be less dependent on the will, and to have their origin in the temperament or natural taste, particularly the latter, which springs from causes that are not always visible; it lies in the physical organization. _Antipathy_ is, in fact, a natural _aversion_ opposed to sympathy: _dislike_ and _haired_ are, on the contrary, voluntary, and seem to have their root in the angry passions of the heart; the former is less deep-rooted than the latter, and is commonly awakened by slighter causes: _repugnance_ is not an habitual and lasting sentiment, like the rest; it is a transitory but strong _dislike_ to anything. People of a quiet temper have an _aversion_ to disputing or argumentation; those of a gloomy temper have an _aversion_ to society; _antipathies_ mostly discover themselves in early life, and as soon as the object comes within the view of the person affected: men of different sentiments in religion or politics, if not of amiable tempers, are apt to contract _dislikes_ to each other by frequent irritation in discourse: when men of malignant tempers come in collision, nothing but a deadly _hatred_ can ensue from their repeated and complicated aggressions toward each other; any one who is under the influence of a misplaced pride is apt to feel a _repugnance_ to acknowledge himself in error.

####avidity 
GREEDINESS, EAGERNESS are terms expressive of a strong desire. _Avidity_, in Latin _aviditas_, from _were_, to desire, expresses very strong desire. _Greediness_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _grœdig, greedy. Eagerness_, through French from the Latin _acer_, sharp, signifies acuteness of feeling.  
_Avidity_ is in mental desires what _greediness_ is in animal appetites: _eagerness_ is not so vehement, but more impatient than _avidity_ or _greediness. Avidity_ and _greediness_ respect simply the desire of possessing; _eagerness_ the general desire of attaining an object. An opportunity is seized with _avidity;_ the miser grasps at money with _greediness_, or the glutton devours with _greediness;_ a person runs with _eagerness_ in order to get to the place of destination: a soldier fights with _eagerness_ in order to conquer; a lover looks with _eager_ impatience for a letter from the object of his affection. _Avidity_ is employed in the adverbial form to qualify an action: we seize with _avidity; greediness_ marks the abstract quality or habit of the mind; _greediness_ is the characteristic of low and brutal minds: _eagerness_ denotes the transitory state of feeling; a person discovers his _eagerness_ in his looks.

####avoid 
**AVOID, ESCHEW, SHUN, ELUDE.**  
_Avoid_ comes from Old French _esvuidier_, to empty out, from French _es_, Latin _ex_, and _vuide, voide_, empty, a word of unknown origin. _Eschew_ comes through French from Old High German _sciuhan_, to frighten. _Shun_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _scunian_, to shun or avoid, whence _schooner_ is derived. _Elude_, in French _éluder_, Latin _eludo_, compounded of _e_, out, and _ludere_, to play, to trick, signifies to get one's self out of a thing by a trick.  
_Avoid_ is both generic and specific; we _avoid_ in _eschewing_ or _shunning_, or we _avoid_ without _eschewing_ or _shunning._ Various contrivances are requisite for _avoiding; eschewing_ and _shunning_ consist only of going out of the way, of not coming in contact; _eluding_, as its derivation denotes, has more of artifice in it than any of the former. We _avoid_ a troublesome visitor under real or feigned pretences of ill-health, prior engagement, and the like; we _eschew_ evil company by not going into any but what we know to be good; we _shun_ the sight of an offensive object by turning into another road; we _elude_ a punishment by getting out of the way of those who have the power of inflicting it. Prudence enables us to _avoid_ many of the evils to which we are daily exposed: nothing but a fixed principle of religion can enable a man to _eschew_ the temptations to evil which He in his path: fear will lead us to _shun_ a madman whom it is not in our power to bind: a want of all principle leads a man to _elude_ his creditors whom he wishes to defraud. We speak of _avoiding_ a danger and _shunning_ a danger; but to _avoid_ it is in general not to fall into it; to _shun_ it is with care to keep out of the way of it.

####awaken 
**AWAKEN, EXCITE, PROVOKE, ROUSE, STIR UP.**  
To _awaken_ is to make _awake_ or alive. _Excite_, in Latin _excito_, compounded of the intensive syllable _ex_, and _citare_, to arouse, means to arouse very much. _Provoke_ (see [aggravate](entry://aggravate)). TO _rouse_ is to cause to rise. _Stir_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _styrian_, to move, which may be allied to _storm._ To _excite_ and _provoke_ convey the idea of producing something: _rouse_ and _stir up_ that of only calling into action that which previously exists; to _awaken_ is used in either sense. To _awaken_ is a gentler action than to _excite_, and this is gentler than to _provoke._ We _awaken_ by a simple effort; we _excite_ by repeated efforts or forcible means; we _provoke_ by words, looks, or actions. The tender feelings are _awakened;_ affections, or the passions in general, are _excited;_ the angry passions are commonly _provoked._ Objects of distress _awaken_ a sentiment of pity; competition among scholars _excites_ a spirit of emulation; taunting words _provoke_ anger. _Awaken_ is applied only to the individual and what passes within him; _excite_ is applicable to the outward circumstances of one or many; _provoke_ is applicable to the conduct or temper of one or many. The attention is _awakened_ by interesting sounds that strike upon the ear; the conscience is _awakened_ by the voice of the preacher, or by passing events: a commotion, a tumult, or a rebellion is _excited_ among the people by the active efforts of individuals; laughter or contempt is _provoked_ by preposterous conduct.  
To _awaken_ is in the moral, as in the physical sense, to call into _consciousness_ from a state of _unconsciousness;_ to _rouse_ is forcibly to bring into action that which is in a state of inaction; and _stir up_ is to bring into a state of agitation or commotion. We are _awakened_ from an ordinary state by ordinary means; we are _roused_ from an extraordinary state by extraordinary means; we are _stirred up_ from an ordinary to an extraordinary state. The mind of a child is _awakened_ by the action on its senses as soon as it is born; there are some persons who are not _roused_ from their stupor by anything but the most awful events; and there are others whose passions, particularly of anger, are _stirred up_ by trifling circumstances. The conscience is sometimes _awakened_ for a time, but the sinner is not _roused_ to a sense of his danger, or to any exertions for his own safety, until an intemperate zeal is _stirred up_ in him by means of enthusiastic preaching, in which case the vulgar proverb is verified, that the remedy is as bad as the disease. Death is a scene calculated to _awaken_ some feeling in the most obdurate breast: the tears and sighs of the afflicted _excite_ a sentiment of commiseration; the most equitable administration of justice may _excite_ murmurs among the discontented; a harsh and unreasonable reproof will _provoke_ a reply: oppression and tyranny mostly _rouse_ the sufferers to a sense of their injuries; nothing is so calculated to _stir up_ the rebellious spirits of men as the harangues of political demagogues. 

####aware 
**AWARE, ON ONE'S GUARD, APPRISED, CONSCIOUS. **  
_Aware_ is a corruption of Anglo-Saxon _gewœr_, from Anglo-Saxon _ge_, a common prefix, and _wœr_, cautious, modern English _wary. Guard_ comes through Old French from a Teutonic word cognate with English _ward_, and meant to _watch_, hence _guard. Apprise_ is derived through French _appris_, the past participle of _apprendre_, from Latin _ad_, to, and _prehendere_, to take. _Conscious_, in Latin _conscius_, compounded of _con_ and _scire_, to know, signifies knowing within one's self.  
The idea of having the expectation or knowledge of a thing is common to all these terms. We are _aware_ of a thing when we calculate upon it; we are _on our guard_ against it when we are prepared for it; we are _apprised_ of that of which we have had an intimation, and are _conscious_ of that in which we have ourselves been concerned. To be _aware_, and _on one's guard_, respect the future; to be _apprised_, either the past or present; to be conscious, only the past. Experience enables a man to be _aware_ of consequences; prudence and caution dictate to him the necessity of being _on his guard_ against evils. Whoever is fully _aware_ of the precarious tenure by which he holds all his goods in this world will be _on his guard_ to prevent any calamities, as far as depends upon thé use of means in his control. We are _apprised_ of events, or what passes outwardly, through the medium of external circumstances; we are _conscious_ only through the medium of ourselves, or what passes within. 

####awe 
**AWE, REVERENCE, DREAD.**  
_Awe_ is a Scandinavian word allied to Gothic _agis_, fear, anguish. _Reverence_ comes from Latin _re_, intensive, and _vereri_, to fear, allied to English _wary. Dread_ comes from _drœdan_, in Anglo-Saxon _ondrœdan_, to fear.  
_Awe_ and _reverence_ both denote a strong sentiment of respect, mingled with some emotions of fear; but the former marks the much stronger sentiment of the two: _dread_ is an unmingled sentiment of fear for one's personal security. _Awe_ may be awakened by the help of the senses and understanding; _reverence_ by that of the understanding only; and _dread_ principally by that of the imagination. Sublime, sacred, and solemn objects awaken _awe;_ they cause the beholder to stop and consider whether he is worthy to approach them any nearer; they rivet his mind and body to a spot, and make him cautious lest by his presence he should contaminate that which is hallowed: exalted and noble objects produce _reverence;_ they lead to every outward mark of obeisance and humiliation which it is possible for him to express; terrific objects excite _dread;_ they cause a shuddering of the animal frame, and a revulsion of the mind which is attended with nothing but pain. When the creature places himself in the presence of the Creator — when he contemplates the immeasurable distance which separates himself, a frail and finite mortal, from his infinitely perfect Maker — he approaches with _awe;_ even the sanctuary where he is accustomed thus to bow before the Almighty acquires the power of awakening the same emotions in his mind. Age, wisdom, and virtue, when combined in one person, are never approached without _reverence;_ the possessor has a dignity in himself that checks the haughtiness of the arrogant, that silences the petulance of pride and self-conceit, that stills the noise and giddy mirth of the young, and communicates to all around a sobriety of mien and aspect. A grievous offender is seldom without _dread;_ his guilty conscience pictures everything as the instrument of vengeance, and every person as pronouncing his merited sentence. The solemn stillness of the tomb will inspire _awe_, even in the breast of him who has no _dread_ of death. Children should be early taught to have a certain degree of _reverence_ for the Bible as a book, in distinction from all other books. 

####awkward 
**AWKWARD, CLUMSY.**  
_Awkward_ is composed of an English suffix _ward_, added to a Scandinavian word, and originally signified transversely or "in a backhanded manner. " _Clumsy_ comes through Middle English _clumsed_, benumbed, from the Scandinavian — _clumsy_ being therefore the manner or action characteristic of benumbed hands.  
These epithets denote what is contrary to rule and order, in form or manner. _Awkward_ respects outward deportment; _clumsy_ the shape and make of the object: a person has an _awkward_ gait, is _clumsy_ in his whole person. _Awkwardness_ is the consequence of bad education; _clumsiness_ is mostly a natu-7 ral defect. Young recruits are _awkward_ in marching and _clumsy_ in their manual exercise.  
They may be both employed figuratively in the same sense, and sometimes in relation to the same objects: when speaking of _awkward_ contrivances, or _clumsy_ contrivances, the latter expresses the idea more strongly than the former.  
**AWKWARD, CROSS, UNTOWARD, CROOKED, FROWARD, PERVERSE.** — _Awkward_ (see above). _Cross_, from the noun _cross_, implies the quality of being _transverse_, hence contrary, like the arms of a cross. _Untoward_ signifies the reverse of _toward. Crooked_ signifies the quality of resembling a _crook_, a Scandinavian word meaning hook, angle, etc. _Froward_ is composed of an English suffix added to a Scandinavian word — _fro_ for English _from_ — and means in the contrary direction. _Perverse_, Latin _perversus_, participle of _perverto_, compounded of _per_ and _verto_, signifies turned aside.  
_Awkward, cross, untoward_, and _crooked_ are used as epithets in relation to the events of life or the disposition of the mind; _froward_ and _perverse_ respect only the disposition of the mind. _Awkward_ circumstances are apt to embarrass; _cross_ circumstances to pain; _crooked_ and _untoward_ circumstances to defeat. What is _crooked_ springs from a _perverted_ judgment; what is _untoward_ is independent of human control. In our intercourse with the world there are always little _awkward_ incidents arising which a person's good sense and good nature will enable him to pass over without disturbing the harmony of society. It is the lot of every one in his passage through life to meet with _cross_ accidents that are calculated to ruffle the temper, but he proves himself to be the wisest whose serenity is not so easily disturbed. A _crooked_ policy obstructs the prosperity of individuals, as well as of states. Many men are destined to meet with severe trials in the frustration of their dearest hopes, by numberless _untoward_ events which call forth the exercise of patience; in this case the Christian can prove to himself and others the infinite value of his faith and doctrine. When used with regard to the disposition of the mind, _awkward_ expresses less than _froward_, and _froward_ less than _perverse. Awkwardness_ is an habitual frailty of temper; it includes certain weaknesses and particularities, pertinaciously adhered to: _crossness_ is a partial irritation resulting from the state of the humors, physical and mental. _Frowardness_ and _perversity_ lie in the will: a _froward_ temper is capricious; it wills or wills not to please itself without regard to others. _Perversity_ lies deeper; taking root in the heart, it assumes the shape of malignity; a _perverse_ temper is really wicked; it likes or dislikes by the rule of contradiction to another's will. _Untowardness_ lies in the principles; it runs counter to the wishes and counsels of another. An _awkward_ temper is connected with self-sufficiency; it shelters itself under the sanction of what is apparently reasonable; it requires management and indulgence in dealing with it. _Crossness_ and _frowardness_ are peculiar to children; indiscriminate indulgence of the rising will engenders those diseases of the mind which, if fostered too long in the breast, become incorrigible by anything but a powerful sense of religion. _Perversity_ is, however, but too commonly the result of a vicious habit, which embitters the happiness of all who have the misfortune of coming in collision with it. _Untowardness_ is also another fruit of these evil tempers. A _froward_ child becomes an _untoward_ youth, who turns a deaf ear to all the admonitions of an afflicted parent.

####axiom 
**AXIOM, MAXIM, APHORISM, APOPHTHEGM (old form; modern APOTHEGM), SAYING, ADAGE, PROVERB, BYWORD, SAW.**  
_Axiom_, in French _axiome_, Latin _axioma_, comes from the Greek _άξίωπα_, worth, signifying the thing valued. _Maxim_, in French _maxime_, in Latin _maxima_ for _maxima sentiarum_, the most important opinion. _Aphorism_, from Greek _άψορίζειν_, to define or limit, meant originally a definition. _Apothegm_, in Greek _απόφθεγμα_, from _άπό_, from, and _φθέγγεσθαι_, to utter, to speak pointedly, signifies a pointed saying. _Saying_ signifies literally what is said — that is, said habitually. _Adage,_ in Latin _adagium_, comes from Latin _ad_, to, to the point, and a stem signifying to say. _Proverb_, in French _proverbe_, Latin _proverbium_, compounded of _pro_, publicly, and _verbum_, a saying, signifies a common saying. _Byword_ signifies a word by-the-by, or by-the-way, in the course of conversation. _Saw_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _sagu_, a saying, from the verb to _say_ in its older form.  
A given sentiment conveyed in a specific sentence, or form of expression, is the common idea included in the signification of these terms. The _axiom_ is a truth of the first value; a self-evident proposition which is the basis of other truths. A _maxim_ is a truth of the first moral importance for all practical purposes. An _aphorism_ is a truth set apart for its pointedness and excellence. _Apothegm_ is, in respect to the ancients, what _saying_ is in regard to the moderns; it is a pointed sentiment pronounced by an individual and adopted by others. _Adage_ and _proverb_ are vulgar sayings, the former among the ancients, the latter among the moderns. The _byword_ is a casual saying originating in some local circumstance. The _saw_, which is a barbarous corruption of _saying_, is the _saying_ formerly current among the ignorant.  
_Axioms_ are in science what _maxims_ are in morals; self-evidence is an essential characteristic in both; the _axiom_ presents itself in so simple and undeniable a form to the understanding as to exclude doubt and the necessity for reasoning. The _maxim_, though not so definite in its expression as the _axiom_, is at the same time equally parallel to the mind of man, and of such general application that it is acknowledged by all moral agents who are susceptible of moral truth; it comes home to the common sense of all mankind. "Things that are equal to one and the same thing are equal to each other" — "Two bodies cannot occupy the same space at the same time, " are _axioms_ in mathematics and metaphysics. "Virtue is the true source of happiness" — "The happiness of man is the end of civil government, " are _axioms_ in ethics and politics. "To err is human, to forgive divine" — "When our vices leave us, we flatter ourselves that we leave them, " are among the number of _maxims._ Between _axioms_ and _maxims_ there is this obvious difference to be observed: that the former are unchangeable both in matter and manner and admit of little or no increase in number; but the latter may vary with the circumstances of human life, and admit of considerable extension.  
An _aphorism_ is a speculative principle either in science or morals, which is presented in a few words to the understanding; it is the substance of a doctrine, ana many _aphorisms_ may contain the abstract of a science. Of this description are the _aphorisms_ of Hippocrates, and those of Lavater in physiognomy.  
_Sayings_ and _apothegms_ differ from the preceding, inasmuch as they always carry the mind back to the person speaking; there is always one who says when there is a _saying_ or an _apothegm_, and both acquire a value as much from the person who utters them as from the thing that is uttered: when Leonidas was asked why brave men prefer honor to life, his answer became an _apothegm;_ namely, that "they hold life by fortune, and honor by virtue": of this description are the _apothegms_ comprised by Plutarch, the _sayings_ of Franklin's Poor Richard, or those of Dr. Johnson: they are happy effusions of the mind which men are fond of treasuring.  
The _adage_ and _proverb_ are habitual as well as general _sayings_, not repeated as the _sayings_ of one, but of all; not adopted for the sake of the person, but for the sake of the thing; and they have been used in all ages for the purpose of conveying the sense of mankind on ordinary subjects. The _adage_ of former times is the _proverb_ of the present time: if there be any difference between them, it lies in this, that the former are the fruit of knowledge and long experience, the latter of vulgar observations; the _adage_ is therefore more refined than the _proverb._ Adversity is our best teacher, according to the Greek _adage_, "What hurts us instructs us. " "Old birds are not to be caught with chaff" is a vulgar _proverb. Bywords_ rarely contain any important sentiment; they mostly consist of familiar similes, nicknames, and the like, as the Cambridge, _byword_ of "Hobson's choice, " signifying that or none: the name of Nazarene was a _byword_ among the Jews for a Christian. A _saw_ is vulgar in form and vulgar in matter: it is the partial _saying_ of particular neighborhoods, originating in ignorance and superstition: of this description are the _sayings_ which attribute particular properties to animals or to plants, termed old women's _sayings._

####aye 
**AYE, AY.**  
_Aye_ and _ay_ are words frequently confused — so often confused, indeed, that the distinction between them is not clearly maintained even in good writing; but the distinction exists. _Aye_, pronounced like _I_, seems to have been originally a different form from _ay;_ it means yes, and is still used in poetry and in old-fashioned and humble colloquial speech, for yes — as well as in the parliamentary procedure of voting. _Ay_, which rhymes with day, gay, etc., from a Teutonic root meaning age, eternity, means ever, always, and continually. It should not be spelled or pronounced like _aye_. 

####babble 
**BABBLE, CHATTER, CHAT, PRATTLE, PRATE.**  
_Babble_ is allied to German _bappeln_, Dutch _babbelen_, French _babiller_, etc. The suffix _le_ is frequentative, and the verb means to keep on saying 6a, _ba_, syllables imitative of a child trying to talk. _Chatter_ and _chat_ are imitative words. _Prate_, allied to Dutch _prat_, talk, Low German _praten_, etc., is possibly an imitative word. _Prattle_ is the frequentative of _prate_ and means to keep on prating.  
All these terms mark a superfluous or improper use of speech: _babble_ and _chatter_ are onomatopoeias drawn from the noise or action of speaking; _babbling_ denotes rapidity of speech, which renders it unintelligible; hence the term is applied to all who make use of many words to no purpose: _chatter_ is an imitation of the noise of speech properly applied to magpies or parrots, and figuratively to a corresponding vicious mode of speech in human beings. The vice of _babbling_ is most commonly attached to men, that of _chattering_ to women: the _babbler_ talks much to impress others with his self-importance; the _chatterer_ is actuated by self-conceit and a desire to display her volubility: the former cares not whether he is understood; the latter cares not if she be but heard. _Chatting_ is both harmless and respectable; the winter's fireside invites neighbors to assemble and _chat_ away many an hour which might otherwise hang heavy on hand, or be spent less inoffensively; _chatting_ is the practice of adults; _prattling_ and _prating_ that of. children, the one innocently, the other impertinently; the _prattling_ of babes has an interest for every feeling mind, but for parents it is one of their highest enjoyments; _prating_, on the contrary, is the consequence of ignorance and childish assumption: a _prattler_ has all the unaffected gayety of an uncontaminated mind; a _prater_ is forward, obtrusive, and ridiculous. 

####baccalaureate 
**BACCALAUREATE, BACHELOR.**  
_Baccalaureate_ is a term of uncertain derivation. _Baccalaureate_ and _bachelor_ are derived from the same Latin word,_ baccalaureus_, the one directly, the other through the medium of French. _Baccalaureus_ meant "cowherd", from _bacca_, cow; thence it became the term applied to any young man. _Bachelor_ in the Middle Ages signified a young knight, one not old enough to display his own banner, and still fighting under the standard of another. In modern times it has been specialized to mean, on the one hand, an unmarried man, on the other, the recipient of the first degree at a university — the degree of _Bachelor_ of Arts. The term _baccalaureate_ has been similarly specialized to refer to the type of academic initiation into mature life that corresponds in modern times to the military initiation of the young _bachelor_ at arms. _Baccalaureate_ refers to the ceremony of receiving the _bachelor's_ degree, and, in America, it refers especially to the farewell sermon preached to students on the Sunday preceding their graduation, which is called the _baccalaureate_ sermon. 

####back 
**BACK, BACKWARD, BEHIND.**  
_Back_ and _backward_ are used only as adverbs: _behind_, either as an adverb or a preposition — to go _back_ or _backward_, to go _behind_, or _behind_ the wall. _Back_ denotes the situation of being and the direction of going; _backward_ simply the manner of going; a person stands _back_ who does not wish to be in the way; he goes _backward_ when he does not wish to turn his _back_ to an object. _Back_ marks simply the situation of a place, _behind_ the situation of one object with regard to another: a person stands _back_ who stands in the _back_ part of any place; he stands _behind_ who has any one in front of him: the _back_ is opposed to the front, _behind_ to before.

####bad 
**BAD, WICKED, EVIL.**  
_Bad_ is formed from Anglo-Saxon _bœddel_, a hermaphrodite, an effeminate man, hence a worthless fellow — thence _bad_, worthless. _Wicked_, Anglo-Saxon _wikke_, evil, is derived from the substantive _wikke_, a witch. _Wicked_ means bewitched, possessed of an evil spirit._ Bad_ respects moral and physical qualities in general; _wicked_, only moral qualities. _Evil_, Anglo-Saxon _yfel,_ comes from a widely distributed Germanic root, the ultimate origin of which is unknown. _Evil_, in its full extent, comprehends both _badness_ and _wickedness._  
Whatever offends the taste and sentiments of a rational being is _bad;_ food is _bad_ when it disagrees with the constitution; the air is _bad_ which has anything in it disagreeable to the senses or hurtful to the body; books are _bad_ which only inflame the imagination or the passions. Whatever is _wicked_ offends the moral principles of a rational agent: any violation of the law is _wicked_, as law is the support of human society; an act of injustice or cruelty is _wicked_, as it opposes the will of God and the feelings of humanity. _Evil_ is either moral or natural, and may be applied to every object that is contrary to good; but the term is employed only for that which is in the highest degree _bad_ or _wicked._  
When used in relation to persons, both refer to the morals, but _bad_ is more general than _wicked;_ a _bad_ man is one who is generally wanting in the performance of his duty; a _wicked_ man is one who is chargeable with actual violations of the law, human or divine; such a one has an _evil_ mind. A _bad_ character is the consequence of immoral conduct; but no man has the character of being _wicked_ who has not been guilty of some known and flagrant vices: the inclinations of the best are _evil_ at certain times.

####badly 
**BADLY, ILL.**  
_Badly_ means in the manner of _bad_ (see above). _Ill_ is a Scandinavian word, not a contraction of the word which appears in Anglo-Saxon as _yfel_, in Modern English as _evil._  
These terms are both employed to modify the actions or qualities of things, but _badly_ is always annexed to the action, and _ill_ to the quality: as to do anything _badly_, the thing is _badly_ done, an _ill-judged_ scheme, an ill-contrived measure, an ill-disposed person. 

####baffle 
**BAFFLE, DEFEAT, DISCONCERT, CONFOUND.**  
_Baffle_ is a Scotch word of doubtful origin meaning originally to disgrace or vilify. Compare French _beffler_, and Middle High German _beffen_, to scold. It may be of imitative origin, like the slang _biff_, meaning to slap. _Defeat_, in French _défait_, participle of _défaire_, is derived from _dis_, apart, and _facere_, to do, and signifies to undo. _Disconcert_ is compounded of the privative _dis_ and _concert_, signifying to throw out of concert or harmony, to put into disorder. _Confound_, in French _confondre_, is compounded of _con_ and _fundere_, to pour, and signifies to melt or mix together in general disorder.  
When applied to the derangement of the mind or rational faculties, _baffle_ and _defeat_ respect the powers of argument; _disconcert_ and _confound_, the thoughts and feelings: _baffle_ expresses less than _defeat; disconcert_ less than _confound;_ a person is _baffled_ in argument who is for the time discomposed and silenced by the superior address of his opponent; he is _defeated_ in argument if his opponent has altogether the advantage of him in strength of reasoning and justness of sentiment: a person is _disconcerted_ who loses his presence of mind for a moment, or has his feelings any way discomposed; he is _confounded_ when the powers of thought and consciousness become torpid or vanish. A superior command of language or a particular degree of effrontery will frequently enable a person to _baffle_ one who is advocating the cause of truth: ignorance of the subject, or a want of ability, may occasion a man to be _defeated_ by his adversary, even when he is supporting a good cause: assurance is requisite to prevent any one from being _disconcerted_ who is suddenly detected in any disgraceful proceedings: hardened effrontery sometimes keeps the daring villain from being _confounded_ by any events, however awful.  
When applied to the derangement of plans, _baffle_ expresses less than _defeat, defeat_ less than _confound_, and _disconcert_ less than all. Obstinacy, perseverance, skill, or art _baffles;_ superior force _defeats;_ awkward circumstances _disconcert;_ the visitation of God _confounds._ When wicked men strive to obtain their ends, it is a happy thing if their adversaries have sufficient skill and address to _baffle_ all their arts, and sufficient power to _defeat_ all their projects; but sometimes when our best endeavors fail in our own behalf, the devices of men are _confounded_ by the interposition of Heaven. It frequently happens, even in the common transactions of life, that the best schemes are _disconcerted_ by the trivial casualties of wind and weather. The obstinacy of a disorder may _baffle_ the skill of the physician; the imprudence of the patient may _defeat_ the object of his prescriptions; the unexpected arrival of a superior may _disconcert_ the unauthorized plan of those who are subordinate; the miraculous destruction of his army _confounded_ the project of the king of Assyria.

####ban 
**BAN, CURSE, DENOUNCE, FORBID, PROHIBIT.**  
These terms represent various types and degrees of social and spiritual ostracism. _Ban_, in Anglo-Saxon _bannan_, is a Germanic word which has entered most of the Romance languages and appears in the word _abandon_, derived in English from a French phrase. In ancient German law a _ban_ was a sentence of outlawry pronounced against one who had escaped from justice or refused to submit to trial; the _ban of the empire_ was a penalty imposed on refractory princes and even on cities, in Germany, _Ban_ implies a formal _forbidding_ or _prohibiting._ To _curse_, Anglo-Saxon _cursian_, is to attempt to out souls off from all sources of spiritual life and health. It is a spiritual _ban_, as it were, and corresponds in the world of the spirit to the political outlawry suggested by the word _ban. Denounce_, from Latin _de_, fully, and _nuntiare_, to make a formal statement, suggests a public criticism or accusation which might lead to a _ban_, but which, in itself, does not imply that the person denounced is _forbidden_ to enjoy any of his natural rights or _prohibited_ from doing what he pleases. _Forbidden_, Anglo-Saxon _forbeodan_, from _for_, a privative prefix, and _beodan_, to bid, means to bid a person not to do something. It does not imply formal and public action, as does the word _ban. Prohibit_, from Latin _prohibere, pro_ and _habere_, means to keep another from doing something, and implies an exertion of some force besides the purely verbal one expended in _forbidding._ It does not imply formal and public action. 

####band 
**BAND, COMPANY, CREW, GANG.**  
_Crew_, is from _crue_, a shortened form of _accrue_, a reinforcement, from Old French _accroistre_, to increase, from Latin _accrescere. Gang_, from Anglo-Saxon _gangen_, to go, signifies a group of individuals who go together.  
All these terms denote a small association for a particular object: a _band_ is an association where men are bound together by some strong obligation whether taken in a good or bad sense, as a _band_ of soldiers, a _band_ of robbers. A _company_ marks an association for convenience, without any particular obligation, as a _company_ of travellers, a _company_ of strolling players. _Crew_ marks an association collected together by some external power, or by coincidence of plan and motive: in the former case it is used for a ship's _crew;_ in the latter and bad sense of the word it is employed for any number of evil-minded persons met together from different quarters and cooperating for some bad purpose. _Gang_ is used in a bad sense for an association of thieves, murderers, and depredators in general; or in a technical sense for those who work together.

####bane 
**BANE, PEST, RUIN.**  
_Bane_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _bana_, a murderer, from a root found in Icelandic _bani_, death, Gothic _banja_, a wound, Greek _φόνος_, murder, etc. _Pest_, from Latin _pestis_, originally meant a deadly disease. _Ruin_, Latin _ruina_, is derived from _ruere_, to fall down. Milton uses _ruin_ with special reference to its etymology to mean something rushing down, falling headlong.  
These terms borrow their figurative signification from three of the greatest evils in the world: namely, poison, plague, and destruction. _Bane_ is said of things only; _pest_ of persons only: whatever produces a deadly corruption is the _bane;_ whoever is as obnoxious as the plague is a _pest;_ luxury is the _bane_ of civil society; gaming is the _bane_ of all youth; sycophants are the _pests_ of society. _Ruin_ comprehends more than either _bane_ or _pest_, these latter being comparatively partial mischiefs, but _ruin_ extends to every part of that which it affects. 

####banish 
**BANISH, EXILE, EXPEL.**  
_Banish_, in French _bannair_, German _bannen_, signifies to put out of a community by a ban or civil interdict, which was formerly either ecclesiastical or civil. _Exile_, in French _exiler_, from the Latin _exilium_, banishment, and _exul_, an exile, compounded of _extra_ and _solum_, the soil, signifies to put away from one's native soil or country. _Expel_, in Latin _expello_, compounded of _ex_ and _pellere_, to drive, signifies to drive out.  
The idea of exclusion, or of a coercive removal from a place, is common to these terms: _banishment_ includes the removal from any place, or the prohibition of access to any place, where one has been or whither one is in the habit of going; _exile_ signifies the removal from one's home; to _exile_, therefore, is to _banish_, but to _banish_ is not always to _exile;_ the Tarquins were _banished_ from Rome never to return; Coriolanus was _exiled_, or driven from his home. _Banishment_ follows from a decree of justice; _exile_ either by the necessity of circumstances or an order of authority: _banishment_ is a disgraceful punishment inflicted by tribunals upon delinquents; _exile_ is a disgrace incurred without dishonor: _exile_ removes us from our country; _banishment_ drives us from it ignominiously: it was the custom in Russia to _banish_ offenders to Siberia; Ovid was _exiled_ by an order of Augustus. _Banishment_ is an action, a compulsory exercise of power over another, which must be submitted to; _exile_ is a state into which we may go voluntarily; many Romans chose to go into _exile_ rather than await the judgment of the people, by whom they might have been _banished. Banishment_ and _expulsion_ both mark a disgraceful and coercive exclusion, but _banishment_ is authoritative; it is a public act of government: _expulsion_ is simply coercive; it is the act of a private individual or a small community. _Banishment_ always supposes a removal to a distant spot, to another land; _expulsion_ never reaches beyond a particular house or society: _expulsion_ from the university, or any public school, is the necessary consequence of discovering a refractory temper or a propensity to insubordination.  
_Banishment_ and _expulsion_ are likewise used in a figurative sense, although _exile_ is not: in this sense, _banishment_ marks a distant and entire removal; _expulsion_ a violent removal: we _banish_ that which it is not prudent to retain; we _expel_ that which is noxious. Hopes are _banished_ from the mind when every prospect of success has disappeared; fears are _banished_ when they are altogether groundless; envy, hatred, and every evil passion should be _expelled_ from the mind as disturbers of its peace: harmony and good-humor are best promoted by _banishing_ from conversation all subjects of difference in religion and politics; good morals require that every unseemly word should be _expelled,_

####bare 
**BARE, NAKED, UNCOVERED.**  
_Bare_ and _naked_ are both Anglo-Saxon words — the one being in Anglo-Saxon _bœr_, the other _nacod._ For the derivation of _uncover_ see [cover](entry://cover).  
_Bare_ marks the condition of being without a particular covering; _naked_ that of being without any covering; _bare_ is therefore often substituted for _naked_, to a certain degree: we speak of _bareheaded, barefoot_, to expose the _bare_ arm; but a figure is _naked_, or the body is _naked._  
When applied to other objects, _bare_ conveys the idea of a particular want; _naked_ of a general want: as the _bare_ ground, _bare_ walls, a _bare_ house, where the idea of want in a certain particular is strongly conveyed; but _naked_ walls, _naked_ fields, a _naked_ appearance, denote the absence of covering that is usual or general: _bare_ in this sense is frequently followed by the object that is wanted; _naked_ is mostly employed as an adjunct: a tree is _bare_ of leaves: this constitutes it a _naked_ tree.  
They preserve the same analogy in their figurative application: a _bare_ sufficiency is that which scarcely suffices; the _naked_ truth is that which has nothing about it to intercept the view of it from the mind.  
_Naked_ and _uncovered_ bear a strong resemblance to each other; to be _naked_ is, in fact, to have the body _uncovered_, but many things are _uncovered_ which are not _naked;_ nothing is said to be _naked_ but what in the nature of things, or according to the usages of men, ought to be covered; everything is _uncovered_ from which the covering is removed. According to our natural sentiments of decency or our acquired sentiments of propriety, we expect to see the _naked_ body covered with clothing: the _naked_ tree covered with leaves; the _naked_ walls covered with paper or paint; and the _naked_ country covered with verdure or habitations: on the other hand, plants are left _uncovered_ to receive the benefit of the sun or rain; furniture or articles of use or necessity are left _uncovered_ to suit the convenience of the user; or a person may be _uncovered_, in the sense of _bareheaded_, on certain occasions; so in the moral application, what is _naked_ is without the ordinary or necessary appendage; what is _uncovered_ is simply without any covering.  
**BARE, SCANTY, DESTITUTE.** — _Bare_ (see above). _Scanty_ is derived from _scant_, a Scandinavian word, from a root found in Icelandic _skamt_, short, brief, and in the somewhat colloquial verb _scamp_, in the phrase "to scamp work, " etc. _Destitute_, in Latin _destitutus_, participle of _destitua_, compounded of _de_, privative, and _statuo_, appoint or provide for, signifies unprovided for or wanting.  
All these terms denote the absence or privation of some necessary. _Bare_ and _scanty_ have a relative sense: _bare_ respects what serves for ourselves; _scanty_ that which is provided by others. A subsistence is _bare;_ a supply is _scanty._ An imprudent person will estimate as a _bare_ competence what would supply an economist with superfluities. A hungry person will consider as a _scanty_ allowance what would more than suffice for a moderate eater.  
_Bare is_ said of those things which belong to our corporeal sustenance; _destitute_ is said generally of whatever one wants. A person is _bare_ of clothes or money; he is _destitute_ of friends, of resources, or of comforts.  
**BARE, MERE.** — _Bare_ (see above). _Mere_ is derived from Latin _merus_, pure, unmixed, used especially of wine.  
_Bare_ is used in a positive sense; _mere_, negatively. The _bare_ recital of some events brings tears. The _mere_ circumstance of receiving favors ought not to bind any person to the opinions of another. The _bare_ idea of being in the company of a murderer is apt to awaken horror in the mind. The _mere_ attendance at a place of worship is the smallest part of a Christian's duty.

####base 
**BASE, VILE, MEAN.**  
For the origin of _base_ see [abase](entry://abase). _Vile_ is derived from Latin _vilis_, of small price, cheap, worthless. _Mean_, Anglo-Saxon _mame_, usually found in _gemœne_, German _gemein_, instead of in its simple form, signifies common; hence low, ordinary, of little value, etc.  
_Base is_ a stronger term than _vile_, and _vile_ than _mean. Base_ marks a high degree of moral turpitude: _vile_ and _mean_ denote in different degrees the want of all that can be valued or esteemed. What is _base_ excites our abhorrence, what is _vile_ provokes disgust, what is _mean_ awakens contempt. _Base_ is opposed to magnanimous, _vile_ to noble, _mean_ to generous. Ingratitude is _base;_ it does violence to the best affections of our nature: flattery is _vile;_ it violates truth in the grossest manner for the lowest purposes of gain: compliances are _mean_ which are derogatory to the rank, dignity, or responsibility of the individual. The more elevated a person's rank, the greater is his _baseness_ who abuses his influence to the injury of those who repose confidence in him. The lower the rank of the individual and the more atrocious his conduct, the _viler_ is his character. The more respectable the station of the person and the more extended his wealth, the greater is his _meanness_ when he descends to practices fitted only for his inferiors. The schoolmaster of Falerii was guilty of the _basest_ treachery in surrendering his helpless charge to the enemy: the Roman general, therefore, with true nobleness of mind, treated him as a _vile_ malefactor. Sycophants are in the habit of practising every _mean_ artifice to obtain favor.

####battle 
**BATTLE, COMBAT, ENGAGEMENT, ACTION.**  
_Battle_, in French _bataille_, comes from the Latin _batuere_, to beat, signifying a beating. _Combat_ signifies literally a _battle_, one with the other, from _con_, with, and _batuere. Engage-meat_ signified binding with a pledge, fighting under a pledge to defend some one or some cause, from French _en_ and _gage_, a pledge — a word of Teutonic origin. _Action_ signifies the state of acting and being acted upon by the way of fighting.  
_Battle_ is a general term; _combat, engagement_, and _action_ are particular terms, having a modified signification. _Battle_, as an act of fighting, may be applied to what takes place either between bodies or individuals, as the _battles_ between the Carthaginians and the Romans, or between Cæsar and Pompey; _combat_ applies only to what takes place between individuals, as the _combat_ between the Horatii and the Curiam. _Battle_ is taken for that which is premeditated and prepared, as _battles_ between armies always are; _combats_ are frequently accidental, if not unexpected, as the _combats_ of Hercules or the combat between Menelaus and Paris.  
_Battle_ and _combat_ are taken for the act of fighting generally; _engagement_ and _action_ are seldom used in any other acceptation. _Battle_ in this case is taken without any qualification of time, circumstances, or manner, as armed for _battle_, wager of _battle_, and the like; _combat_ refers to the act of individuals fighting with one another: to challenge to single _combat;_ the _combat_ was obstinate and bloody: _engagement_ and _action_, which are properly abstract and general terms to denote engaging and acting, but here limited to the act of fighting, have always a reference to something actually passing or described as passing, and are therefore confined to descriptions, as in describing what passes dining the _engagement_ or _action_, or the number of engagements or actions, in which an individual is present or takes a part. It is reported of the German women that whenever their husbands went to _battle_ they used to go into the thickest of the _combat_ to carry them provisions or dress their wounds; and that sometimes they would take part in the _engagement._

####be 
**BE, EXIST, SUBSIST.**  
_Be_, with its inflections, is to be traced through the Northern languages to an original Aryan root signifying to live, to exist. _Exist_, in French _exister_, Latin _existo_, compounded of _e_ or _ex_ and _sisto_, signifies to "stand out" against the fortunes of life, hence simply to live, to keep on living. From this derivation of the latter verb arises the distinction in the use of the two words. The former is applicable either to the accidents of things or to the substances of things themselves; the latter only to substances or things that stand or _exist_ of themselves. We say of qualities, of forms, of actions, of arrangement, of movement, and of every different relation, whether real, ideal, or qualificative, that they _are;_ we say of matter, of spirit, of body, and of all substances, that they _exist._ Man _is_ man, and will _be_ man under all circumstances and changes of life: he _exists_ under every known climate and variety of heat or cold in the atmosphere.  
_Being_ and _existence_ as nouns have this further distinction, that the former is employed not only to designate the abstract action of _being_, but is metaphorically employed for the sensible object that _is;_ the latter is confined altogether to the abstract sense. Hence we speak of human _beings; beings_ animate or inanimate; the Supreme _Being:_ but of the _existence_ of a God; _existence_ of innumerable worlds; the _existence_ of evil.  
_Being_ may in some cases be indifferently employed for _existence_, particularly in the grave style: when speaking of animate objects, as the _being_ of a God; our frail _being;_ and when qualified in a compound form is preferable, as our _well-being._  
_Subsist_ is properly a species of _existing;_ from the Latin prepositive _sub_ signifying for a time, it denotes temporary or partial _existence._ Everything _exists_ by the creative and preservative power of the Almighty; that which _subsists_ depends for its _existence_ upon the chances and changes of life. To _exist_, therefore, designates simply the event of _being_ or _existing;_ to _subsist_ conveys the accessory ideas of the mode and duration of _existing._ Man _exists_ while the vital or spiritual part of him remains; he _subsists_ by what he obtains to support life. Friendships _exist_ in the world, notwithstanding the prevalence of selfishness; but they cannot _subsist_ for any length of time between individuals in whom this base temper prevails.  
**BE, BECOME, GROW.** — _Be_ (see above). _Become_ signifies to _come_ to _be_ — that is, to _be_ in course of time. _Grow_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _growan_, to produce green shoots, and is allied to _green. Be_ is positive; _become_ is relative: a person _is_ what he _is_ without regard to what he _was;_ he _becomes_ that which he _was_ not before. We judge of a man by what he _is_, but we cannot judge of him as to what he will _become;_ this year he _is_ immoral and irreligious, but by the force of reflection on himself he may _become_ the contrary in another year. To _become_ includes no idea of the mode or circumstance of its _becoming;_ to _grow_ is to _become_ by a gradual process: a man may _become_ a good man from a vicious one, in consequence of a sudden action on his mind; but he _grows_ in wisdom and virtue by means of an increase in knowledge and experience.

####bear 
**BEAR, YIELD.**  
_Bear_, Anglo-Saxon _beran_, is allied to Latin _ferre_, Greek _φέρειν_, to carry, hence to bring forth that which has been carried and nourished within a living organism or a life-giving substance. _Yield_ (see [afford](entry://afford)).  
_Bear_ conveys the idea of creating within itself; _yield_, that of giving from itself. Animals _bear_ their young, inanimate objects _yield_ their produce. An apple-tree _bears_ apples; the earth _yields_ fruits. _Bear_ marks properly the natural power of bringing forth something of its own kind; _yield_ is said of the result or quantum brought forth: shrubs _bear_ leaves, flowers, or berries, according to their natural properties; flowers _yield_ seeds plentifully or otherwise, as they are favored by circumstances.  
**BEAR, CARRY, CONVEY, TRANSPORT.** — _Carry_ comes immediately from Latin _carrus_, a four-wheeled vehicle, and hence meant to bear about in a car. _Convey_ is derived from _con_, with, and _via_, way, and means to bear with one on the way. _Transport_, in French _transporter_, Latin _transporto_, compounded of _trans_, over, and _portare_, to carry, signifies to _carry_ to a distance.  
To _bear_ is simply to take the weight of any substance upon one's self, or to have the object about one: to _carry_ is to remove a body from the spot where it was: we always _bear_ in _carrying_, but we do not always _carry_ when we _bear._ Both may be applied to things as well as persons: whatever receives the weight of anything _bears_ it; whatever is caused to move with anything _carries_ it. That which cannot be easily _borne_ must be burdensome to _carry;_ in extremely hot weather it is sometimes irksome to _bear_ the weight even of one's clothing: Virgil praises the pious Æneas for having _carried_ his father on his shoulders in order to save him from the sacking of Troy. Weak people or weak things are not fit to _bear_ heavy burdens: lazy people prefer to be _carried_ rather than to _carry_ anything.  
To _bear_ is said either of persons or inanimate things; to _carry_, in its proper application, is said of persons only.  
To _bear_ supposes the bearer for the most part to be stationary, but it may be applied to one who is in motion, as the _bearer_ of a letter. In poetry it is mostly used in such connection for _carry._  
To _carry_ always supposes the _carrier_ to be in motion, and that which is _carried_ may either be about his person or resting on something, as to _carry_ a thing in one's hand, or to _carry_ it in a basket.  
_Bear_ and _carry_ preserve this distinction in their figurative or moral application; _bear_ is applied to that which for the most part remains with the person or thing _bearing; carry_ to that which passes by means of the person: thus to _bear_ or _carry_ a name: to _bear_ a name is to have it without regard to time or place; to _carry_ a name is to _carry_ it down to posterity. So to _bear_ a burden, to _carry_ weight, authority, conviction, etc.; to _bear_ a stamp, to _carry_ a mark to one's grave.  
_Convey_ and _transport_ are species of _carrying. Carry_ in its particular sense is employed either for personal exertions or actions performed by the help of other means; _convey_ and _transport_ are employed for such actions as are performed not by immediate personal intervention or exertion: a porter _carries_ goods on his knot (i.e.__, shoulder-pad); goods are _conveyed_ in a wagon; they are _transported_ in a vessel. _Convey_ expresses simply the mode of removing; _transport_ annexes to this the idea of the place and the distance. Merchants get the goods _conveyed_ into their warehouses which they have had _transported_ from distant countries. Pedestrians take no more with them than what they can conveniently _carry;_ could armies do the same, one of the greatest obstacles to the indulgence of human ambition would be removed; for many an incursion into a peaceful country is defeated for the want of means to _convey_ provisions sufficient for such numbers; and when mountains or deserts are to be traversed, another great difficulty presents itself in the _transportation_ of artillery.  
**BEAR, SUFFER, ENDURE, SUPPORT.** — To _bear_ (see above). _Suffer_, in Latin _suffero_, compounded of _sub_, under, and _ferre_, to bear, signifies to "bear up under" — an expression frequently heard in English, which, like several others cited in this book, literally translates the Latin word. _Endure_, from Latin _durus_, hard, lasting, signifies to harden one's self under trouble. _Support_, from _sub_ and _portare_, to carry, has the same meaning as _suffer_, as far as its etymology is concerned.  
The idea of receiving the weight or pressure of any object is common to these terms, which differ only in the circumstances of the action. To _bear_ is the general term taken in the proper sense without any qualification; the other terms denote different modes of _bearing._ To _bear_ may be said of that which is not painful, as to bear a burden, in the indifferent sense; so likewise the term to _support_, as to _support_ a person who is falling; but for the most part these, as well as the other two terms, are taken in the bad sense. In this case to _bear_ and to _suffer_ are both involuntary acts as far as they relate to evils imposed upon us without our will; but _bear_ is also voluntary, inasmuch as it denotes the manner of receiving the evil, so as to diminish the sense of it; and _suffer_ is purely passive and involuntary. We are born to _suffer_ — hence the necessity for us to learn to _bear_ all the numerous and diversified evils which to us are obnoxious.  
To _bear_ is applied either to ordinary or extraordinary evils, and is either a temporary or a permanent act of the resolution; to _endure_ is applied only to great evils requiring strong and lasting resolution: we _bear_ disappointments and crosses; we _endure_ hunger, cold, tortures, and provocations. The first object of education should be to accustom children to _bear_ contradictions and crosses, that they may afterward be enabled to _endure_ every trial.  
To _bear_ and _endure_ signify to receive becomingly the weight of what befalls ourselves; to _support_ signifies to bear either our own or another's evils, for we may either _support_ ourselves or be _supported_ by others, but in this former case we _bear_ not so much from the resolution to _bear_ as from the motives which are presented to the mind; a person _supports_ himself in the hour of trial by the condolence of friends, but still more by the power of religion.  
The words _suffer_ and _endure_ are said only of persons and personal matters: to _bear_ and _support_ are said also of things; the former in respect to things of any weight, large or small; the latter in respect to things of great weight, as the beams are cut according to the weight they have to _bear;_ a building is _supported_ by pillars.

####beat 
**BEAT, STRIKE, HIT.**  
_Beat_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _beatan_, from a Teutonic root signifying to push. The resemblance to Latin _batuere_, French _battre_, is merely accidental. _Strike_ is derived from a Teutonic root meaning to give blows to. _Hit_ is a Scandinavian word meaning to light on, to attain to, hence to strike, and is allied to _hint._ For a similar relation between the idea of lighting upon and striking see the slang expression "He _lit_ into me. "  
To _beat_ is to redouble blows; to _strike_ is to give one single blow; but the bare touching in consequence of an effort constitutes _hitting._ We never _beat_ but with design, nor _hit_ without an aim, but we may _strike_ by accident. _Beating_ was formerly resorted to as almost the only mode of punishment. He who brandishes a stick heedlessly may _strike_ another to his serious injury. _Hitting_ is the object of the marksman.  
**BEAT, DEFEAT, OVERPOWER, ROUT, OVERTHROW.** — _Beat_ is here figuratively employed in the sense of the former section. _Defeat_, from the French _défaire_, implies to undo, and _overpower_ to have the power over any one. To _rout_ is derived from _rupta_, broken, from Latin _rumpere_, to break, and _overthrow_, to throw over or upside down.  
_Beat_ respects personal contests between individuals or parties; _defeat, rout, overpower_, and _overthrow_ are employed mostly for contests between numbers. A general is _beaten_ in important engagements; he is _defeated_ and may be _routed_ in partial attacks; he is _overpowered_ by numbers, and _overthrown_ in set engagements. To _beat_ is an indefinite term expressive of no particular degree: the being _beaten_ may be attended with greater or less damage. To be _defeated_ is a specific disadvantage, it is a failure in a particular object of more or less importance. To be _overpowered_ is a positive loss; it is a loss of the power of acting, which may be of longer or shorter duration; to be _routed is_ a temporary disadvantage; a _rout_ alters the _route_ or course of proceeding, but does not disable: to be _overthrown_ is the greatest of all mischiefs, and is applicable only to great armies and great concerns: an _overthrow_ commonly decides a contest. _Beat_ is a term which reflects more or less dishonor on the general or the army, or on both: _defeat_ is an indifferent term; the best generals may sometimes be _defeated_ by circumstances which are above human control; _overpowering_ is coupled with no particular honor to the winner nor disgrace to the loser; superior power is oftener the result of good fortune than of skill. The bravest and finest troops may be _overpowered_ in cases which exceed human power: a _rout_ is always disgraceful, particularly to the army; it always arises from want of firmness: an _overthrow_ is fatal rather than dishonorable; it excites pity rather than contempt. 

####beatification 
**BEATIFICATION, CANONIZATION.**  
These acts emanate from the pontifical authority, by which the Pope declares a person, whose life had been exemplary and accompanied with miracles, as entitled to enjoy eternal happiness after his death, and determines in consequence the sort of worship which should be paid to him. In the act of _beatification (beare_, to make blessed) the Pope pronounces only as a private person, and uses his own authority only in granting to certain persons, or to a religious order, the privilege of paying a particular worship to a _beatified_ object. In the act of _canonization_, the Pope speaks as a judge after a judicial examination on the state, and decides the sort of worship which ought to be paid by the whole church. 

####beau 
See [gallant](entry://gallant)

####beautiful 
**BEAUTIFUL, FINE, HANDSOME, PRETTY.**  
_Beautiful_, or full of _beauty_, in French _beauté_, comes from _beau, belle_, in Latin _bellus_, fair. _Fine_ is derived from _finitus_, the past participle of _finire_, to finish, and meant _finished_, polished, finely wrought, hence, on the one hand, delicate, small; on the other hand, impressive, comely, the very opposite of delicate. _Handsome_ originally meant dexterous, _handy_, and hence well formed, comely, good-looking. _Pretty_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _prœtig_, deceitful, tricky, etc.; its ultimate origin and meaning are uncertain. It may have developed its present meaning through the same psychological process that has turned words like _cunning, cute_, etc., into endearing descriptive epithets.  
Of these epithets, which denote what is pleasing to the eye, _beautiful_ conveys the strongest meaning; it marks the possession of that in its fullest extent of which the other terms denote the possession in part only. _Fineness, handsomeness_, and _prettiness_ are to _beauty_ as parts to a whole. When taken in relation to persons, a woman is _beautiful_ who in feature and complexion possesses a grand assemblage of graces; a woman is _fine_ who with a striking figure unites shape and symmetry; a woman is _handsome_ who has good features, and _pretty_ if with symmetry of feature be united delicacy. The _beautiful_ is determined by fixed rules; it admits of no excess or defect; it comprehends regularity, proportion, and a due distribution of color, and every particular which can engage the attention: the _fine_ must be coupled with a certain grandeur of figure; it is incompatible with that which is small; a little woman can never be _fine;_ the _handsome_ is a general assemblage of what is agreeable; it is marked by no particular characteristic but the absence of all deformity: _prettiness_ is always coupled with simplicity; it is incompatible with that "which is large; a tall woman with masculine features cannot be _pretty. Beauty_ is peculiarly a female perfection; in the male sex it is rather a defect; a man can scarcely be _beautiful_ without losing his manly characteristics — boldness and energy of mind, strength and robustness of limb; but though a man may not be _beautiful_ or _pretty_, he may be _fine_ or _handsome._  
When said in relation to other objects, _beautiful, fine, pretty_ have a strong analogy. With respect to the objects of nature, the _beautiful_ is displayed in the works of creation, and wherever it appears it is marked by elegance, variety, harmony, proportion, but, above all, that softness which is peculiar to female _beauty;_ the _fine_, on the contrary, is associated with the grand, and the _pretty_ with the simple: the sky presents either a _beautiful_ aspect or a _fine_ aspect, but not a _pretty_ aspect. A rural scene is _beautiful_ when it unites richness and diversity of natural objects with superior cultivation; it is _fine_ when it presents the bolder and more impressive features of nature, consisting of rocks and mountains; it is _pretty_ when, divested of all that is extraordinary, it presents a smiling view of nature in the gay attire of shrubs, and many-colored flowers, and verdant meadows, and luxuriant fields.  
_Beautiful, fine_, and _pretty_ are applied indifferently to works of nature and art; _handsome_ mostly to those of art only: a _beautiful_ picture, a _fine_ drawing, a _pretty_ cap, and _handsome_ furniture.  
In the moral application _beautiful_ sentiments have much in them to interest the affections as well as the understanding; they make a vivid impression: _fine_ sentiments mark an elevated mind and a loftiness of conception; they occupy the understanding and afford scope for reflection; they make a strong impression: _pretty_ ideas are but pleasing associations or combinations that only amuse for the time being, without producing any lasting impression. We may speak of a _beautiful_ poem, although not a _beautiful_ tragedy; but a _fine_ tragedy, and a _pretty_ comedy. Imagery may be _beautiful_ and _fine_, but seldom _pretty. Handsome_ conveys the idea not only of that which is agreeable in appearance, but also that which is agreeable to the understanding and the moral feelings from its fitness and propriety; it is therefore applied with this collateral meaning to moral circumstances and actions, as a _handsome_ present, a _handsome_ apology.

####becoming 
**BECOMING, DECENT, SEEMLY, FIT, SUITABLE.**  
_Becoming_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _becuman_, to arrive, happen; hence to happen to fit. _Decent_, in French _décent_, in Latin _decens_, participle of _decere_, to beseem, is allied to _decus_, an ornament, honor, fame, etc. _Seemly_ is derived from a root which appears in _same, similar_, etc., and _ly_, meaning like; it means literally "same like, " just like, hence suitable, fitting, etc. _Fit_ is a Scandinavian word meaning to knit together, to draw laces together, etc. _Suitable_, from _suit_, signifies able to _suit;_ and _suit_, in French _suite_, Latin _secuta_, comes from _sequor, to_ follow, signifying to follow.  
What is _becoming_ respects the manner of being in society such as it ought; as to person, time, and place. _Decency_ regards the manner of displaying one's self so as to be approved and respected. _Seemliness_ is very similar in sense to _decency_, but is confined to such things as immediately strike the observer. _Fitness_ and _suitableness_ relate to the disposition, arrangement, and order of either being or doing, according to persons, things, or circumstances. The _becoming_ consists of an exterior that is pleasing to the view: _decency_ involves moral propriety; it is regulated by the fixed rules of good-breeding: _seemliness_ is decency in the minor morals or in one's behavior; _fitness_ is regulated by local circumstances, and _suitableness_ by the established customs and usages of society. The dress of a woman is _becoming_ that renders her person more agreeable to the eye; it is _decent_ if it in no wise offends modesty; it is _unseemly_ if it in any wise violates propriety; it _is fit_ if it De what the occasion requires; it is _suitable_ if it be according to the rank and character of the wearer. What is _becoming_ varies for every individual; the age, the complexion, the stature, and the habits of the person must be consulted in order to obtain the appearance which is _becoming;_ what _becomes_ a young female, or one of fair complexion, may not _become_ one who is further advanced in life, or who has dark features: _decency_ and _seemliness_ are one and the same for all; all civilized nations have drawn the exact fine between the _decent_ and the _indecent_, although fashion or false principles may sometimes draw persons aside from this fine: _fitness_ varies with the seasons, or the circumstances of persons; what is _fit_ for the winter is _unfit_ for the summer, or what is _fit_ for dry weather is _unfit_ for wet; what is _fit_ for town is not _fit_ for the country; what is _fit_ for a healthy person is not _fit_ for one that is infirm: _suitableness_ accommodates itself to the external circumstances and conditions of persons; the house, the furniture, the equipage of a prince must be _suitable_ to his rank; the retinue of an ambassador must be _suitable_ to the character which he has to maintain, and to the wealth, dignity, and importance of the nation whose monarch he represents. Gravity _becomes_ a judge or a clergyman at all times: an unassuming tone is _becoming_ in a child when he addresses his superiors. _Decency_ requires a more than ordinary gravity when we are in the house of mourning or prayer; it is _indecent_, for a child, on the commission of a fault, to affect a careless unconcern in the presence of those whom he has offended. _Seemliness_ is an essential part of good manners; to be loud or disputative in company is _unseemly._ There is a _fitness_ or _unfitness_ in persons for one another's society: education fits a person for the society of the noble, the wealthy, the polite, and the learned. There is a _suitableness_ in people's tempers for one another; such a _suitability_ is particularly requisite for those who are destined to live together: selfish people, with opposite tastes and habits, can never be _suitable_ companions.  
**BECOMING, COMELY, GRACEFUL.** — _Becoming_ (see preceding). _Comely_, or _come like_, signifies coming or appearing as one would have it. _Graceful_ signifies full of _grace._  
These epithets are employed to mark in general what is agreeable to the eye. _Becoming_ denotes less than _comely_, and this less than _graceful;_ nothing can be _comely_ or _graceful_ which is _unbecoming;_ although many things are _becoming_ which are neither _comely_ nor _graceful. Becoming_ respects the decorations of the person and the exterior deportment; _comely_ respects natural embellishments; _graceful_, natural or artificial accomplishments: manner is _becoming;_ figure is _comely;_ air, figure, or attitude is _graceful. Becoming_ is a relative term depending on the circumstances and condition of the person: what is _unbecoming_ in one case may not be so in another, and what is _becoming_ in one person may not be so in another: what is _graceful_ is so absolutely and at all times, although it may not be seen and acknowledged without the aid of cultivation.

####beg 
**BEG, DESIRE.**  
_Beg_ (see [ask](entry://ask)). _Desire_, Latin _desidero_, is probably allied to _sidus, sideris_, star, which also appears in _consider._ To _desire_, from _de_, from, and _sidus_, star, may mean to be turned away from the light of the stars.  
To _beg_ marks the wish; to _desire_, the will and determination. _Beg_ is the act of an inferior, or one in a subordinate condition; _desire_ is the act of a superior: we _beg_ a thing as a favor; we _desire_ it as a right: children _beg_ their parents to grant them an indulgence: parents _desire_ their children to attend to their business.  
**BEG, BESEECH, SOLICIT, ENTREAT, SUPPLICATE, IMPLORE, CRAVE.** — _Beg_ (see above). _Beseech_, compounded of _be_ and _seken_, seek, is an intensive verb, signifying to seek strongly. _Solicit_, in French _soliciter_, Latin _solicito_, is probably compounded of _sollus_ and _citus_, aroused, signifying to rouse altogether. _Entreat_, compounded of _en_ or _in_ and _treat_, in French _traiter_, Latin _tracto_, to manage, signifies to act upon. _Supplicate_, in Latin _supplicatus_, participle of _supplico_, compounded of _sub_ and _plicare_, to _fold_, signifies to bend the body down, in token of submission or distress, in order to awaken notice. _Implore_, in French _implorer_, Latin _imploro_, compounded of _in_ and _plorare_, to weep or lament, signifies to act upon by weeping. _Crave_, from Anglo-Saxon _crafian_, to demand, means to long for earnestly.  
All these terms denote a species of asking varied as to the person, the object, and the manner; the first four do not mark such a state of dependence in the agent as the last three: to _beg_ denotes a state of want; to _beseech, entreat_, and _solicit_, a state of urgent necessity; _supplicate_ and _implore_, a state of abject distress; _crave_, the lowest state of physical want: one _begs_ with importunity; _beseeches_ with earnestness; _entreats_ by the force of reasoning and strong representation: one _solicits_ by virtue of one's interests, _supplicates_ by a humble address; _implores_ by every mark of dejection and humiliation. _Begging_ is the act of the poor when they need assistance: _beseeching_ and _entreating_ are resorted to by friends and equals when they want to influence or persuade, but _beseeching_ is more urgent, _entreating_ more argumentative: _solicitations_ are employed to obtain favors, which have more respect to the circumstances than the rank of the solicitor: _supplicating_ and _imploring_ are resorted to by sufferers for the relief of their misery, and are addressed to those who have the power of averting or increasing the calamity: _craving_ is the consequence of longing; it marks an earnestness of _supplication_, an abject state of suffering dependence. Those who are too idle to work commonly have recourse to _begging;_ a kind parent will sometimes rather _beseech_ an undutiful child to lay aside his wicked courses than plunge him deeper into guilt by an ill-timed exercise of authority; when we are _entreated_ to do an act of civility, it is a mark of unkindness to be heedless to the wishes of our friends; gentlemen in office are perpetually exposed to the _solicitations_ of their friends, to procure for themselves, or their connections, places of trust and emolument; a slave _supplicates_ his master for pardon when he has offended, and _implores_ his mercy to mitigate, if not to remit, the punishment; a poor wretch, suffering with hunger, _craves_ a morsel of bread. 

####begin 
**BEGIN, COMMENCE, ENTER UPON.**  
_Begin_, in German _beginnen_, is compounded of _be_ and _ginnen_, signifying to do a thing first. _Commence_ is derived through French from Low Latin _cominitiare_, from _con_, and _in_, into, and _ire_, to go, meaning to initiate, to enter upon something. _Enter_, in Latin _intra_, within, signifies, with the proposition _upon_, to go into a thing.  
_Begin_ and _commence_ are so strictly allied in signification that it is not easy to discover the difference in their application, although a minute difference does exist. To _begin_ respects the order of time; to _commence_, the exertion of setting about a thing: whoever _begins_ a dispute is termed the aggressor; no one should _commence_ a dispute unless he can calculate the consequences, and. as this is impracticable, it is better never to _commence_ disputes. _Begin_ is opposed to end; _commence_ to complete: a person _begins_ a thing with a view of ending it; he _commences_ a thing with a view of completing it. To _begin_ is either transitive or intransitive; to _commence_ is mostly transitive: a speaker _begins_ by apologizing; he _commences_ his speech with an apology: happiness frequently ends where prosperity _begins;_ whoever _commences_ any undertaking, without estimating his own power, must not expect to succeed. To _begin_ is used either for things or persons; to _commence_ for persons only: all things have their _beginning;_ in order to effect anything, we must make a _commencement;_ a word _begins_ with a particular letter, or a line _begins_ with a particular word; a person _commences_ his career. Lastly, _begin_ is more colloquial than _commence;_ thus we say, to _begin_ the work, to _commence_ the operation: to _begin_ one's play; to _commence_ the pursuit: to _begin_ to write; to _commence_ the letter.  
To _commence_ and _enter upon_ are as closely allied in sense as the former words; they differ principally in application: to _commence_ seems rather to denote the making an experiment; to _enter upon_, that of first doing what has not been tried before; we _commence_ an undertaking; we _enter upon_ an employment: speculating people are very ready to _commence_ schemes; considerate people are always averse to _entering upon_ any office until they feel themselves fully adequate to discharge its duties.

####behavior 
**BEHAVIOR, CONDUCT, CARRIAGE, DEPORTMENT, DEMEANOR.**  
_Behavior_, from Anglo-Saxon _behœbban_, composed of the prefix _be_ and the verb which now appears as _have_, signifies to have one's self, or have self-possession. _Conduct_, in Latin _conductus_, participle of _conduco_, compounded of _con_ and _ducere_, to lead along, signifies, literally, leading one's self along, acting as a guide to one's self. _Carriage_, the abstract of _carry_ (see [bear](entry://bear)), signifies the act of carrying one's body, or one's self. _Deportment_ from Latin _de_, from, and _portare_, to carry, means, literally, what is expressed in our colloquial expression, "He _carried it off_ well. " _Demeanor_ is a coined word from Middle English _demenen_, to demean or behave, which comes through Old French from Late Latin _minare_, to drive cattle, to conduct, signifying to conduct others, then to conduct one's self, to control or guard one's own action.  
_Behavior_ respects corporeal or mental actions; _conduct_, mental actions; _carriage, deportment_, and _demeanor_ are different species of _behauior. Behavior_ respects all actions exposed to the notice of others; _conduct_, the general line of a person's moral proceedings: we speak of a person's _behavior_ at table or in company, in a ball-room, in the street, or in public; of his _conduct_ in the management of his private concerns, in the direction of his family, or in his different relations with his fellow-creatures. _Behavior_ applies to the minor morals of society; _conduct_, to those of the first moment: in our intercourse with others we may adopt a civil or polite, a rude or boisterous _behavior;_ in our serious transactions we may adopt a peaceable, discreet, or prudent, a rash, dangerous, or mischievous _conduct._ The _behavior_ of young people in society is of particular importance; it should, above all things, be marked with propriety in the presence of superiors and elders: the youth who does not learn betimes a seemly _behavior_ in company will scarcely know how to _conduct_ himself judiciously on any future occasion.  
_Carriage_ respects simply the manner of _carrying_ the body; _deportment_ includes both the action and the _carriage_ of the body in performing the action: _demeanor_ respects only the moral character or tendency of the action; _deportment_ is said only of those exterior actions that have an immediate reference to others; _demeanor_, of the general _behavior_ as it relates to the circumstances and situation of the individual: the _carriage_ is that part of _behavior_ which is of the first importance to attend to in young persons. A _carriage_ should neither be haughty nor servile; to be graceful, it ought to have a due mixture of dignity and condescension: the _deportment_ of a man should be suited to his station; a humble _deportment_ is becoming in inferiors; a stately and forbidding _deportment_ is very unbecoming in superiors: the _demeanor_ of a man should be suited to his situation; the suitable _demeanor_ of a judge on the bench, or of a clergyman in the pulpit, or when performing his clerical functions, adds much to the dignity and solemnity of the office itself. The _carriage_ marks the birth and education: an awkward _carriage_ stamps a man as vulgar: a graceful _carriage_ evinces refinement and culture. The _deportment_ marks either the habitual or the existing temper of the mind: whoever is really impressed with the solemnity and importance of public worship will evince his impressions by a gravity of _deportment:_ the _demeanor_ is most commonly used to denote the present temper of the mind; as a modest _demeanor_ is particularly suitable for one who is in the presence of the person whom he has offended.

####belief 
**BELIEF, CREDIT, TRUST, FAITH.**  
In _belief_ the _be_ stands for an earlier _ge_ which appears in the German _glauben_, originally _ge-lauben_, to believe. The root is the same as that which appears in the adjective _lief_, dear, and the Latin _libet_, it pleases, and, in this case, signifies the pleasure or assent of the mind. _Credit_ is derived from the Latin _credere_, to believe, which also gives rise to the words _credulous, credible, creed_, etc. _Trust_ is a Germanic word (German _trost_, consolation), from a root whence _true, truth, trow_, etc., are derived, meaning protection, confidence, consolation, etc. _Faith_, Old French _fei_, is derived from Latin _fidem_ (accusative), Greek _πίσης_, faith, from _πεθειν_, to persuade.  
_Belief_ is the generic term, the others are specific; we _believe_ when we _credit_ and _trust_, but not always _vice versa. Belief_ rests on no particular person or thing; but _credit_ and _trust_ rest on the authority of one or more individuals. Everything is the subject of _belief_ which produces one's assent: the events of human life are _credited_ upon the authority of the narrator: the words, promises, or the integrity of individuals are _trusted;_ the power of persons and the virtue of things are objects of _faith. Belief_ and _credit_ are particular actions or sentiments: _trust_ and _faith_ are permanent dispositions of the _mind._ Things are entitled to our _belief;_ persons are entitled to our _credit;_ but people repose a _trust_ in others, or have a _faith_ in others. Our _belief_ or _unbelief_ is not always regulated by our reasoning faculties or the truth of things: we often _believe_, from presumption, ignorance, or passion, things to be true which are very false. With the bulk of mankind assurance goes further than anything else in obtaining _credit;_ gross falsehoods, pronounced with confidence, will be _credited_ sooner than plain truths told in an unvarnished style. There are no disappointments more severe than those which we feel on finding that we have _trusted_ to men of base principles. Ignorant people have commonly a more implicit _faith_ in any nostrum recommended to them by persons of their own class than in the prescriptions of professional men regularly educated.  
_Belief, trust_, and _faith_ have a religious application, which _credit_ has not. _Belief_ is simply an act of the understanding; _trust_ and _faith_ are active moving principles of the mind. _Belief_ does not extend beyond an assent of the mind to any given proposition; _trust_ and _faith_ impel to action. _Belief_ is to _trust_ and _faith_ as cause to effect: there may be _belief_ without either _trust_ or _faith;_ but there can be no _trust_ or _faith_ without belief; we _believe_ that there is a God who is the creator and preserver of all His creatures; we therefore _trust_ in Him for His protection of ourselves: we _believe_ that Jesus Christ died for the sins of men; we have, therefore, _faith_ in his redeeming grace to save us from our sins. _Belief_ is common to all religions: _trust_ is peculiar to the _believers_ in Divine revelation: _faith is_ employed by distinction for the Christian _faith. Belief_ is purely speculative; and _trust_ and _faith_ are operative: the former operates on the mind, the latter on the outward conduct. _Trust_ in God serves to dispel all anxious concern about the future. Theorists substitute _belief_ for _faith;_ enthusiasts mistake passion for _faith._ True _faith_ must be grounded on a right _belief_ and accompanied with a right practice.

####bend 
**BEND, BENT.**  
_Bend_ and _bent_ are both derived from a root found in the English _bind_, Anglo-Saxon _bindan_, Icelandic _benda_, to stretch, strain. _Bend_ means to strain a bow by fastening the band or string, hence to curve it (Skeat). Both abstract nouns from the verb co _bend;_ the one to express its proper, and the other its moral application: a stick has a _bend;_ the mind has a _bent._ A _bend_ in anything that should be straight is a defect; a _bent_ of the inclination that is not sanctioned by religion is detrimental to a person's moral character and peace of mind. For a vicious _bend_ in a natural body there are various remedies; but nothing will cure a corrupt _bent_ of the will except religion.

####benefaction 
**BENEFACTION, DONATION.**  
_Benefaction_, from the Latin _benefacio_, signifies the thing well done, or done for the good of others. _Donation_, from _dono_, to give or present, signifies the sum presented.  
Both these terms denote an act of charity, but the former comprehends more than the latter: a _benefaction_ comprehends acts of personal service in general toward the indigent; _donation_ respects simply the act of giving and the thing given. _Benefactions_ are for private use; _donations_ are for public service. A _benefactor_ to the poor does not confine himself to the distribution of money; he enters into all their necessities, consults their individual cases, and suits his _benefactions_ to their exigencies; his influence, his counsel, his purse, and his property are employed for their good: his _donations_ form the smallest part of the good which he does.  
**BENEFICENT, BOUNTIFUL or BOUNTEOUS, MUNIFICENT, GENEROUS, LIBERAL.** — _Beneficent_ comes from _benefacio_ (see above). _Bountiful_ signifies full of _bounty_ or goodness, from the French _bonté_, Latin _bonitas. Munificent_, in Latin _munificus_, from _munus_, present, gift, and _facio_, signifies the disposition to make presents. _Generous_, from Latin _generosus_, meant originally of high blood, of noble extraction, and consequently of a noble character. _Liberal_, in French _libéral_, Latin _liberalis_, from _liber_, free, signifies the quality of being like a freeman in distinction from a bondman, and, by a natural association, being of a free disposition, ready to communicate.  
_Beneficent_ respects everything done for the good of others: _bounty, munificence_, and _generosity_ are species of _beneficence; liberality_ is a qualification of all. The first two denote modes of action: the last three either modes of action or modes of sentiment. The sincere well-wisher to his fellow-creatures is _beneficent_ according to his means; he is _bountiful_ in providing for the comfort and happiness of others; he is _munificent_ in dispensing favors; he is _generous_ in imparting his property; he is _liberal_ in all he does. _Beneficence_ and _bounty_ are characteristics of the Deity as well as of His creatures: _munificence, generosity_, and _liberality_ are mere human qualities. _Beneficence_ and _bounty_ are the peculiar characteristics of the Deity: with Him the will and the act of doing good are commensurate only with His power; He was _beneficent_ to us as our Creator, and continues His _beneficence_ to us by His daily preservation and protection; to some, however, He has been more _bountiful_ than to others, by providing them with an unequal share of the good things of this life. The _beneficence_ of man is regulated by the _bounty_ of Providence: to whom much is given, from him much will be required. Instructed by His word, and illumined by that spark of benevolence which was infused into their souls with the breath of life, good men are ready to believe that they are but stewards of all God's gifts, holden for the use of such as are less _bountifully_ provided. They will desire, as far as their powers extend, to imitate this feature of the Deity by bettering with their _beneficent_ counsel and assistance the condition of all who require it and by gladdening the hearts of many with their _bountiful_ provisions.  
Princes are _munificent_, friends are _generous_, patrons _liberal. Munificence_ is measured by the quality and quantity of the thing bestowed; _generosity_ by the extent of the sacrifice made; _liberality_ by the warmth and freedom of the spirit discovered. A monarch displays his _munificence_ in the presents which he sends by his ambassadors to another monarch. A _generous_ man will waive his claims, however powerful they may be, when the accommodation or relief of another is in question. A _liberal_ spirit does not stop to inquire the reason for giving, but gives when the occasion offers. _Munificence_ may spring either from ostentation or a becoming sense of dignity; _generosity_ may spring either from a generous temper or an easy unconcern about property; _liberality_ of conduct is dictated by nothing but a warm heart and an expanded mind. _Munificence_ is confined simply to giving, but we may be _generous_ in assisting, and _liberal_ in rewarding. 

####benefit 
**BENEFIT, FAVOR, KINDNESS, CIVILITY.**  
_Benefit_ signifies here that which is done to benefit (see [advantage](entry://advantage)). _Favor_, in French _faveur_, Latin _favor_ and _favere_, to bear good-will, signifies the act flowing from good-will. _Kindness_ signifies an action that is kind (see **affectionate** under [affection](entry://affection)), _Civility_ signifies that which is _civil._  
The idea of an action gratuitously performed for the advantage of another is common to these terms. _Benefits_ and _favors_ are granted by superiors; _kindnesses_ and _civilities_ pass between equals. _Benefits_ serve to relieve actual wants: the power of conferring and the necessity of receiving them constitute the relative difference in station between the giver and the receiver: _favors_ tend to promote the interest or convenience; the power of giving and the advantage of receiving are dependent on local circumstances, more than on difference of station. _Kindnesses_ and _civilities_ serve to afford mutual accommodation by a reciprocity of kind offices on the many and various occasions which offer in human life: they are not so important as either _benefits_ or _favors_, but they carry a charm with them which is not possessed by the former. _Kindnesses_ are more endearing than _civilities_, and pass mostly between those who are known to each other: _civilities_ may pass between strangers. _Benefits_ tend to draw those closer to one another who by station of life are set at the greatest distance from each other: affection is engendered in him who _benefits_, and devoted attachment in him who is _benefited: favors_ increase obligation beyond its due limits; if they are not asked and granted with discretion, they may produce servility on the one hand and haughtiness on the other  
_Kindnesses_ are the offspring and parent of affection; they convert our multiplied wants into so many enjoyments: _civilities are_ the sweets which we gather on the way as we pass along the journey of life.  
**BENEFIT, SERVICE, GOOD OFFICE.** — _Benefit_ (see above). _Service_ (see [advantage](entry://advantage)). _Office_, in French _office_, Latin _officium_, duty, from _officio_, perhaps from _opi (opus)_, work, and _facere_, to do, signifies the doing of one's work, the fulfilling of a duty or obligation.  
These terms, like the former, agree in denoting some action performed for the good of another, but they differ in the principle on which the action is performed. A _benefit_ is perfectly gratuitous, it produces an obligation; a _service_ is not altogether gratuitous; it is that at least which may be expected, though it cannot be demanded: a _good office_ is between the two; it is in part gratuitous, and in part such as one may reasonably expect. _Benefits_ flow from superiors, or those who are in a situation to do good, and _service_ from inferiors or equals: but _good offices_ are performed by equals only. Princes confer _benefits_ on their subjects; subjects perform _services_ for their princes; neighbors do _good offices_ for one another. _Benefits_ are sometimes the reward of services; _good offices_ produce a return from the receiver. _Benefits_ consist of such things as serve to relieve the difficulties or advance the interests of the receiver: _services_ consist in those acts which tend to lessen the trouble, or increase the ease and convenience, of the person served: _good offices_ consist in the employ of one's credit, influence, and mediation for the advantage of another; it is a species of voluntary service. It is a great _benefit_ to assist an embarrassed tradesman out of his difficulty: it is a great _service_ for a soldier to save the life of his. commander, or for a friend to open the eyes of another to see his danger: it is a _good office_ for any one to interpose his mediation to settle disputes and heal divisions. It is possible to be loaded with _benefits_ so as to affect one's independence of character. _Services_ are sometimes a source of dissatisfaction and disappointment when they do not meet with the remuneration or return which they are supposed to deserve. _Good offices_ tend to nothing but the increase of good-will. Those who perform them are too independent to expect a return, and those who receive them are too sensible of their value not to seek an opportunity for making a return. Politically, they are tendered by a neutral nation to another or others in time of trouble.

####benevolence 
**BENEVOLENCE, BENEFICENCE.**  
_Benevolence_ is literally well willing. _Beneficence_ is literally well doing. The former consists of intention, the latter of action: the former is the cause, the latter the result. _Benevolence_ may exist without _beneficence_, but _beneficence_ always supposes _benevolence;_ a man is not said to be _beneficent_ who does good from sinister views. The _benevolent_ man enjoys but half his happiness if he cannot be _beneficent;_ yet there will still remain to him an ample store of enjoyment in the contemplation of others' happiness; that man who is gratified only with that happiness which he himself is the instrument of producing is not entitled to the name of _benevolent._ As _benevolence_ is an affair of the heart, and _beneficence_ of the outward conduct, the former is confined to no station, no rank, no degree of education or power: the poor may be _benevolent_ as well as the rich, the unlearned as the learned, the weak as well as the strong: the latter, on the contrary, is controlled by outward circumstances, and is therefore principally confined to the rich, the powerful, the wise, and the learned.  
**BENEVOLENCE, BENIGNITY, HUMANITY, KINDNESS, TENDERNESS.** — _Benevolence_ (see above). _Benignity_, in Latin _benignitas_, from _bene_ and _gigno_, beget, signifies the quality or disposition for producing food. _Humanity_, in French _humanité_, Latin _humanitas_, from _humanus_ and _homo_, man signifies the quality of belonging to a man, or having what is common to man. _Kindness_, from _kind_ (see **affectionate** under [affection](entry://affection)). _Tenderness, from tender_, is in Latin _tener_, allied to _tenuis_, thin — hence soft, gentle, mild, etc.  
_Benevolence_ lies in the will, _benignity_ in the disposition or frame of mind; _humanity_ lies in the heart; _kindness_ and _tenderness_ in the affections: _benevolence_ indicates a general good-will to all mankind; _benignity_ particular goodness or _kindness_ of disposition; _humanity_ is a general tone of feeling; _kindness_ and _tenderness_ are particular modes of feeling. _Benevolence_ consists in the wish or intention to do good; it is confined to no station or object: the _benevolent_ man may be rich or poor, and his _benevolence_ will be exerted wherever there is an opportunity of doing good; _benignity_ is mostly associated with the power of doing good, and is actually exerted or displayed in the actions or looks. _Benevolence_ in its fullest sense is the sum of _moral_ excellence, and comprehends every other virtue; when taken in this acceptation, _benignity, humanity, kindness_, and _tenderness_ are but modes of _benevolence. Benevolence_ and _benignity_ tend to the communicating of happiness; _humanity_ is concerned in the removal of evil. _Benevolence_ is common to the Creator and His creatures; it differs only in degree; the former has the knowledge and power as well as the will to do good; man often has the will to do good, without having the power to carry it into effect. _Benignity_ is ascribed to the stars, to Heaven, or to princes; ignorant and superstitious people are apt to ascribe their good fortune to the _benign_ influence of the stars rather than to the gracious dispensations of Providence. _Humanity_ belongs to man only; it is his peculiar characteristic, and ought at all times to be his boast; when he throws off this, his distinguishing badge, he loses everything valuable in him; it is a virtue that is indispensable in his present suffering condition: _humanity_ is as universal in its application as _benevolence;_ wherever there is distress, _humanity_ flies to its relief. _Kindness_ and _tenderness_ are partial modes of affection, confined to those who know or are related to one another; we are _kind_ to friends and acquaintances, _tender_ toward those who are near and dear: _kindness_ is a mode of affection most fitted for social beings; it is what every one can show, and every one is pleased to receive: _tenderness_ is a state of feeding that is occasionally acceptable: the young and the weak demand _tenderness_ from those who stand in the closest connection with them, but this feeling may be carried to an excess, so as to injure the object on which it is fixed.

####bent 
**BENT, CURVED, CROOKED, AWRY.**  
For _bent_ see the derivation of _bend. Curved_ is derived from Latin _curvus_, allied to _circus_, and means bent so as to form the arc of a circle. _Awry_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _wrigian_, to turn, whence _wriggle_ is also derived. _Crooked_ (see [awkward](entry://awkward)).  
_Bent_ is here the generic term, all the rest are but modes of the _bent;_ what is _bent_ is opposed to that which is straight; things may therefore be _bent_ to any degree, but when _curved_ they are _bent_ only to a small degree; when _crooked_ they are _bent_ to a great degree: a stick is _bent_ any way; it is _curved_ by being _bent_ one specific way; it is _crooked_ by being _bent_ different ways. Things may be _bent_ by accident or design; they are _curved_ by design or according to some rule; they are _crooked_ by accident or in violation of some rule: a stick is _bent_ by the force of the hand; a line is _curved_ so as to make a mathematical figure; it is _crooked_ so as to lose all figure: _awry_ marks a species of _crookedness_, but _crooked_ is applied as an epithet, and _awry_ is employed to characterize the action; hence we speak of a _crooked_ thing and of sitting or standing _awry._  
**BENT, BIAS, INCLINATION, PREPOSSESSION.** — _Bent_ (see above). _Bias_, in French _biais_, at first signified a slope; its origin is unknown. _Inclination_, in French _inclination_, Latin _inclinatio_, from _inclino_, Greek _κλίνω_, signifies a leaning toward. _Prepossession_, compounded of _pre_ and _possession_, signifies the taking _possession_ of the mind previously or beforehand.  
All these terms denote a preponderating influence on the mind. _Bent_ is applied to the will, affection, and power in general: _bias_ solely to the judgment: _inclination_ and _prepossession_, to the state of the feelings. The _bent_ includes the general state of the mind, and the object on which it fixes a regard: _bias_, the particular influential power which sways the judging faculty: the one is absolutely considered with regard to itself; the other relatively to its results and the object it acts upon. _Bent_ is sometimes, with regard to _bias_, as cause is to effect; we may frequently trace in the particular _bent_ of a person's likes and dislikes the principal _bias_ which determines his opinions. _Inclination_ is a faint kind of _bent; prepossession_ is a weak species of _bias;_ an _inclination is_ a state of something — namely, a state of the feelings: _prepossession_ is an actual something — namely, the thing that prepossesses.  
We may discover the _bent_ of a person's mind, in his gay or serious moments, in his occupations, and in his pleasures; in some persons it is so strong that scarcely an action passes which is not more or less influenced by it, and even the exterior of a man will be under its control; in all disputed matters the support of a party will operate more or less to _bias_ the minds of men for or against particular men or particular measures; when we are attached to the part that espouses the cause of religion and good order, this _bias_ is in some measure commendable and salutary; a mind without _inclination_ would be a blank, and where _inclination_ is there is the groundwork for _prepossession._ Strong minds will be strongly _bent_ and labor under a strong _bias;_ but there is no mind so weak and powerless as not to have its _inclinations_, and none so perfect as to be without its _prepossessions;_ the mind that has virtuous _inclinations_ will be _prepossessed_ in favor of everything that leans to virtue's side: it were well for mankind were this the only _prepossession;_ but in the present mixture of truth and error it is necessary to guard against _prepossessions_ as dangerous anticipations of the judgment: if their object be not perfectly pure, or their force be not qualified by the restrictive powers of the judgment, much evil springs from their abuse.

####bereave 
**BEREAVE, DEPRIVE, STRIP.**  
_Bereave_, in Anglo-Saxon _bereafian_, is compounded of the verbal prefix _be_ and a root found also in _rob, rove_, etc. which suggests the idea of taking by violence. _Deprive_, compounded of _de_ and _prive_, French _priver_, Latin _privo_, from _privus_, private, signifies to cause a thing to be no longer a man's own. _Strip_ is a Germanic word meaning to tear off, to make bare.  
To _bereave_ expresses more than _deprive_, but less than _strip_, which denotes a total and violent _bereavement;_ one is _bereaved_ of children, _deprived_ of pleasures, and _stripped_ of property: we are _bereaved_ of that on which we set most value; the act of _bereaving_ does violence to our inclination: we are _deprived_ of the ordinary comforts and conveniences of life; they cease to be ours: we are _stripped_ of the things which we most want; we are thereby rendered, as it were, naked. _Deprivations_ are preparatory to _bereavements;_ if we cannot bear the one patiently, we may expect to sink under the other: common prudence should teach us to look with unconcern on our _deprivations:_ Christian faith should enable us to consider every _bereavement_ as a step to perfection; that when _stripped_ of all worldly goods we may be invested with those more exalted and lasting honors which await the faithful disciple of Christ.  
_Bereave_ and _deprive_ are applied only to persons, _strip_ may be figuratively applied to things.

####besides 
**BESIDES, MOREOVER.**  
_Besides_ — that is, by the _side_, next to — marks simply the connection which subsists between what goes before and what follows. _Moreover_ — that is, more than all else — marks the addition of something particular to what has already been said. Thus, in enumerating the good qualities of an individual, we may say "he is, _besides_, of a peaceable disposition. " On concluding any subject of question, we may introduce a further cause by a _moreover. "Moreover_, we must not forget the claims of those who will suffer by such a change. "  
**BESIDES, EXCEPT.** — _Besides_, which is here taken as a preposition, expresses the idea of addition. _Except_ expresses that of exclusion. There were many there _besides_ ourselves; no one _except_ ourselves will be admitted. 

####besiege 
**BESIEGE, BESET, ENCOMPASS, INVEST.**  
_Besiege_, a compound of the Anglo-Saxon _be_ by, and the Old French _siege_, a seat, signifies, as a transitive, to surround any place with soldiers, as a city or town, in order to take possession of it by force; literally, to sit down before a place with the view of capturing it; and, figuratively, to surround a person or place, as excited depositors making a run on a bank, a crowd pressing the gate-keepers at a game of baseball or football between favorite players.  
To _beset_ a person or place is to surround him or it with or without hostile intent, to press upon him or it on all sides, and, as applied to a city or fortification, to entangle it with obstructions, to prevent those within from escaping. To _encompass_, from Latin _cum_, with, and _passus_, pace or step, whence _compass_, a route that comes together and joins itself — a circular object — means to encircle, like a body of troops between hostile forces or placed about an objective point, so as to cut off means of communication, relief, or retreat; and to _invest_ is to blockade, beleaguer, take possession of the outskirts of a place or army with forces, so as to intercept succor by men or provisions.  
These terms are all used here in a military sense, and indicate movements intended to force the surrender of an army, a fortification, a strategic point, or a city by, literally, sitting down and waiting. For applications to other purposes see the articles on INVEST and SURROUND. 

####bespeak 
**BESPEAK, BETOKEN, ENGAGE, SOLICIT.**  
_Bespeak_, a compound of the Anglo-Saxon _be_, by, and _sprecan_, to speak, German _besprechen_, signifies to speak for or on behalf of a person or thing beforehand, in advance, as to _engage_, an article ahead of the time when it will be wanted. For the derivation of _engage_ see _engagement_ under [battle](entry://battle), _engage_ always being suggestive of a _pledge_, however it is used. To _betoken_ is to point out something in the future that is likely to occur from things or conditions known now, to foreshow a result from present indications, to predict or prognosticate, as indications tonight _betoken_ a fair day to-morrow.  
We _engage_ now to buy or do a thing or go somewhere at a future time, pledge or bind a future undertaking by a contract or oath, promise or assume, now an obligation for a future transaction, and we _solicit_ to-day a favor, benefit, or other advantage from another that we expect to obtain some other day when it is needed.

####bewail 
**BEWAIL, BEMOAN, LAMENT.**  
For the derivation of _bewail_ see _wail. Bemoan_ is derived from the verbal prefix _be_ and Anglo-Saxon _mœnan_, to _mean_, intend. _Moan_ in Middle English means both a communication and a complaint; its significance is no doubt influenced by the accidental effect of the sound, which makes it seem like an onomatopoeic word. _Lament_ is formed with the suffix _mentum_ from the base _la_, meaning to utter a cry (Latin _lamentum)._  
All these terms mark an expression of pain by some external sign. _Bewail_ is not so strong as _bemoan_, but stronger than _lament; bewail_ and _bemoan_ are expressions of unrestrained grief or anguish: a wretched mother _bewails_ the loss of her child; a person in deep distress _bemoans_ his hard fate: _lamentation_ may arise from simple sorrow or even imaginary grievances: a sensualist _laments_ the disappointment of some expected gratification. _Bewail_ and _bemoan_ are always indecorous if not sinful expressions of grief which are inconsistent with the profession of a Christian; they are common among the uncultivated, who have not a proper principle to restrain the intemperance of their feelings. There is nothing temporal which is so dear to any one that he ought to _bewail_ its loss; nor any condition of things so distressing or desperate as to make a man _bemoan_ his lot. _Lamentations_ are sometimes allowable; the miseries of others, or our own infirmities and sins, may justly be _lamented._

####bias 
**BIAS, PREPOSSESSION, PRUDENCE.**  
_Bias, prepossession_ (see [bent](entry://bent)). _Prejudice_, in French _préjudice_, Latin _prœ-judicium_, compounded of _pros_, before, and _judicium_, judgment, signifies a judgment beforehand — that is, before examination.  
_Bias_ marks the state of the mind, as leaning to this or that side, so as to determine one's feelings or opinions generally; _prepossession_ denotes the previous occupation of the mind with some particular idea or feeling, so as to preclude the admission of any other; _prejudice_ is a prejudging or predetermining a matter without knowing its merits. We may be _biased_ for or against; we are always _prepossessed_ in favor and mostly _prejudiced_ against; the feelings have mostly to do with the _bias_ and _prepossession_, and the understanding or judgment with the _prejudice. Bias_ and _prepossession_ suppose a something real, whether good or otherwise, which determines the inclination of the mind, but _prejudice_ supposes a something unreal or false, which misleads the judgment: _bias_ and _prepossession_ may therefore be taken in an indifferent, if not a good sense; _prejudice_ always in a bad sense: interest or personal affection may _bias_, but not so as to pervert either the integrity or judgment; _prepossessions_ may be formed of persons at first sight, but they may be harmless, even although they may not be perfectly correct; _prejudices_ prevent the right exercise of the understanding, and consequently favor the cause of falsehood, as when a person has a _prejudice_ against another, which leads him to misinterpret his actions.

####bicker 
**BICKER, CONTEND, DISPUTE, QUARREL.**  
_Bicker_ is derived from a Celtic source, and is probably allied to _peck_ and the word _beak_, that with which a bird _pecks. Bikere_ in Middle English meant a skirmish. In Scottish speech it means to fight by throwing stones, to indulge in strife or contention by word of mouth. _Contend_ is derived from Latin _contendere_, from _con_, against, and _tendere_, to stretch; it means to stretch against, to exert one's strength against.  
To _contend_ is to strive physically or verbally with another, to vie with or against another, to engage in more or less protracted disputes, to take part in a debate by opposing another in speech, to support an opinion or statement against another. To _dispute_ is to attempt to maintain by argument an opinion different from one that has been advanced by another, to call in question or deny the correctness or justness of any statement or conclusion. For a critical comparison of the cognate terms _contend, contest_, and _dispute_ see the article on the former term.  
A _quarrel_, in French _querelle_, an altercation, from the Latin _querela_, a complaint, is, literally, an angry dispute, an open variance between parties, a ground or reason of dispute, something that gives right to angry reprisal. It is the result of a breach of friendship or concord between persons or nations a falling out or disagreement between parties, and may lead to a war between nations, or a judicial settlement of the questions in dispute, or a common brawl or petty fight between individuals. The term _quarrel_ is further considered in connection with _difference, dispute_, and _altercation_ in the article on DIFFERENCE.

####bind 
**BIND, TIE.**  
_Bind_ is a Germanic word, allied to _bundle, bend_, etc. _Tie_ is a Germanic word from the root also found in _tug_, so that to _tie_ is to _tug_ or draw things tightly together.  
The species of fastening denoted by these two words differ both in manner and degree. _Binding_ is performed by circumvolution round a body; _tying_, by involution within itself. Some bodies are _bound_ without being _tied;_ others are _tied_ without being _bound:_ a wounded leg is _bound_, but not _tied;_ a string is _tied_, but not _bound;_ a ribbon may sometimes be _bound_ round the head, and _tied_ under the chin. _Binding_, therefore, serves to keep several things in a compact form together; _tying_ may serve to prevent one single body separating from another: a criminal is _bound_ hand and foot; he is _tied_ to a stake. _Binding_ and _tying_ likewise differ in degree; _binding_ serves to produce adhesion in all the parts of a body; _tying_ only to produce contact in a single part: thus, when the hair is _bound_, it is almost enclosed in an envelope: when it is _tied_ with a string, the ends are left to hang loose.  
A similar distinction is preserved in the figurative use of the terms. A _bond_ of union is applicable to a large body with many component parts; a _tie_ of affection marks an adhesion between individual minds.  
**BIND, OBLIGE, ENGAGE.** — _Bind_ (see above). _Oblige_, in French _obliger_, Latin _obligo_, compounded of _ob_, to, and _ligo_, signifies to tie up. _Engage_, in French _engager_, compounded of _en_ or _in_ and _gage_, a pledge, signifies to _bind_ by means of a pledge.  
_Bind_ is more forcible and coercive than _oblige; oblige_ than _engage._ We are _bound_ by an oath, _obliged_ by circumstances, and _engaged_ by promises.  
Conscience _binds_, prudence or necessity _obliges_, honor and principle _engage._ A parent is _bound_ no less by the law of his conscience than by those of the community to which he belongs to provide for his helpless offspring. Politeness _obliges_ men of the world to preserve a friendly exterior toward those for whom they have no regard. When we are _engaged_ in the service of our king and country, we cannot shrink from our duty without exposing ourselves to the infamy of all the world. We _bind_ a man by a fear of what may befall him; we _oblige_ him by some immediate urgent motive; we _engage_ him by alluring offers and the prospect of gain. A debtor is _bound_ to pay by virtue of a written instrument in law; he is _obliged_ to pay in consequence of the importunate demands of the creditor; he is _engaged_ to pay in consequence of a promise given. A _bond_ is the strictest deed in law; an _obligation_ binds under pain of a pecuniary loss; an _engagement_ is mostly verbal, and rests entirely on the rectitude of the parties.

####bishopric 
**BISHOPRIC, DIOCESE.**  
_Bishopric_ is derived from _bishop_, and the Anglo-Saxon _rice_, meaning dominion, realm, _Bishop_ comes from Greek _επίσκοπος_, overseer, whence _episcopal_ is directly, taken over into English. _Diocese_, in Greek _διοίκησιςι_ compounded of _δίa_ and _οίκέω_, administer throughout, signifies the district within which a government is administered.  
Both these words describe the extent of an episcopal jurisdiction; the first with relation to the person who officiates, the second with relation to the charge. There may, therefore, be a _bishopric_ either where there are many _dioceses_ or no _diocese;_ but according to the import of the term, there is properly no _diocese_ where there is no _bishopric._ When the jurisdiction is merely titular, as in countries where the Catholic religion is not recognized, it is a _bishopric_, But not a _diocese._ On the other hand, the _bishopric_ of Rome, or that of an archbishop, comprehends all the _dioceses_ of the subordinate bishops. Hence it arises that when we speak of the ecclesiastical distribution of a country, we term the divisions _bishoprics;_ but when we speak of the actual office, we term it a _diocese._ England is divided into a certain number of _bishoprics_, not _dioceses._ Every bishop visits his _diocese_, not his _bishopric_, at stated intervals.

####blame 
**BLAME, CENSURE, CONDEMN, REPROVE, REPROACH, UPBRAID.**  
_Blame_, Old French _blasmer_, is derived from Latin _blasphemare_, Greek _βλασφημείν_, to speak ill, whence the word _blaspheme_, to speak, ill of things sacred, is directly taken. _Censure_ (see [accuse](entry://accuse)). _Condemn_, in Latin _condemno_, from _con_ and _damnum_, loss or damage, signifies literally to inflict a penalty or to punish by a sentence. _Reprove_, from the Latin _reprobo_, signifies the contrary of _probo_, approve. _Reproach_, derived through French, from Latin _repropriare_ and _proprius_, near, signifies to cast back upon or against another. _Upbraid_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _up_ and _bregdan_, to braid or weave, and also to pull, draw. The original sense of _upbraid_ was probably to lay hands on, hence to attack, to lay to some one's charge.  
The expression of an unfavorable opinion of a person or thing is the common idea in the signification of these terms. To _blame_ is simply to ascribe a fault to; to _censure_ is to express disapprobation: the former is less personal than the latter. The thing more than the person is _blamed;_ the person more than the thing is _censured._ The action or conduct of a person in any particular may be _blamed_, without reflecting on the individual; but the person is directly _censured_ for that which is faulty in himself.  
Venial or unquestionable faults, or even things that are in themselves amiable, may be the subject of _blame_, but positive faults are the subject of _censure._ A person may be _blamed_ for his good-nature and _censured_ for his negligence.  
Persons are _blamed_ in general or qualified terms, but are _censured_ in terms more or less harsh.  
_Condemn_, like _blame_, though said of personal matters, has more reference to the thing than the person; but that which is _condemned_ is of a more serious nature, and produces a stronger and more unfavorable expression of displeasure or disapprobation, than that which is _blamed. Blame_ and _condemn_ do not necessarily require to be expressed in words, but _censure_ must always be conveyed in direct terms.  
_Reprove_ is even more personal than _censure._ A _reproof_ passes from one individual to another, or to a certain number of individuals; _censure_ may be public or general.  
_Censure_ is frequently provoked by ill-nature or some worse feeling, or dictated by ignorance, as the _censures_ of the vulgar.  
_Reproaching_ and _upbraiding_ are as much the acts of individuals as _reproving_, but the former denote the expression of personal feelings, and may be just or unjust; the latter is presumed to be divested of all personal feelings.  
_Reproaches_ are frequently dictated by resentment or self-interest, _upbraidings_ by contempt or wounded feelings.  
_Blame, condemn, reproach_, and _upbraid_ are applied to ourselves with the same distinction.  
_Reproof_ and _censure_ are most properly addressed to others: in the following example, _censure_, as applied to one's self, is not so suitable as _blame_ or _condemn._  
See also **find fault** under [find](entry://find)  
_Blameless, Irreproachable, Unblemished, Unspotted_, or **SPOTLESS.** — _Blameless_ signifies literally void of _blame. Irreproachable_, that is, not able to be _reproached. Unblemished_, that is, without blemish. _Unspotted_, that is, without _spot_ (see [blemish](entry://blemish)).  
_Blameless_ is less than _irreproachable;_ what is _blameless_ is simply free from _blame_, but that which is _irreproachable_ cannot be _blamed_, or have any _reproach_ attached to it. It is good to say of a man that he leads a _blameless_ life, but it is a high encomium to say that he leads an _irreproachable_ life: the former is but the negative praise of one who is known only for his harmlessness; the latter is the positive commendation of a man who is well known for his integrity in the different relations of society.  
_Unblemished_ and _unspotted_ are applicable to many objects besides that of personal conduct; and when applied to this, their original meaning sufficiently points out their use in distinction from the former two. We may say of a man that he has an _irreproachable_ or an _unblemished_ reputation, and _unspotted_ or _spotless_ purity of life.

####blemish 
**BLEMISH, STAIN, SPOT, SPECK, FLAW.**  
_Blemish_ is derived through French, possibly from Icelandic _blamen_, the livid color of a wound, cognate with English _blue. Stain_ comes from Old French _desteindre_, from Latin _dis_, apart, and _tingere_, to color, and means to discolor. _Spot_ means literally a thing spat out, hence a wet blot. _Speck_ has a similar origin. _Flaw_ is a Scandinavian word and originally signified a crack or break.  
In the proper sense _blemish_ is the generic, the rest specific: a _stain_, a _spot, speck_, and _flaw_ are _blemishes_, but there are likewise many _blemishes_ which are neither _stains, spots, specks_, nor _flaws._ Whatever takes off from the seemliness of appearance is a _blemish._ In works of art the slightest dimness of color or want of proportion is a _blemish._ A _stain_ or _spot_ sufficiently characterizes itself as that which is superfluous and out of its place. A _speck_ is a small _spot;_ and a _flaw_, which is confined to hard substances, mostly consists of a faulty indenture on the outer surface. A _blemish_ tarnishes; a _stain_ spoils; a _spot, speck_, or _flaw_ disfigures. A _blemish_ is rectified, a _stain_ wiped out, a _spot_ or _speck_ removed.  
All these terms are employed figuratively. Even an imputation of what is improper in our moral conduct is a _blemish_ on our reputation: the failings of a good man are so many _spots_ or _specks_ in the bright hemisphere of his virtue: there are some vices which affix a _stain_ on the character of nations, as well as of the individuals who are guilty of them. In proportion to the excellence or purity of a thing, so is any _flaw_ the more easily to be discerned.  
**BLEMISH, DEFECT, FAULT.** — _Blemish_ (see above). _Defect_ is derived from the past participle of _deficere_, Latin, from _de_ and _facere_, and means _undone_, something not made or made in the wrong way. _Fault_, French _faillir_, is derived from Latin _fallere_, to deceive, and signifies that which is wanting in truth and propriety.  
_Blemish_ respects the exterior of an object: _defect_ consists in the want of some specific propriety in an object; _fault_ conveys the idea not only of something wrong, but also of its relation to the author. There is a _blemish_ in fine china; a _defect_ in the springs of a clock; and a _fault_ in the contrivance. An accident may cause a _blemish_ in a fine painting; the course of nature may occasion a _defect_ in a person's speech; but the carelessness of the workman is evinced by the _faults_ in the workmanship. A _blemish_ may be easier remedied than a _defect_ is corrected or a _fault_ repaired.

####blonde 
**BLONDE, GOLDEN, FLAXEN, FAIR, XANTHOUS.**  
All these words indicate a type of fair hair and coloring opposed to _brunette_ or dark. _Blonde_, a word of unknown origin which appears in Medieval Latin and French, signified "a colour midway between golden and light chestnut" (Littré). _Golden_ signifies of the color of gold; _flaxen_ of the color of flax, which is fighter than gold and not so bright. _Fair_ is extended from its meaning of beautiful to indicate the coloring considered most beautiful — _i.e._, the _blonde_ coloring, and is, next to _blonde_, the word most generally applied to signify, not the hair alone, but the whole coloring. _Xanthous_, Greek, _ζανθός_, yellow is the ethnological term indicating the blonde races.

**BLOT, EXPUNGE, RASE, or ERASE, EFFACE, CANCEL, OBLITERATE.**  
_Blot_, signifying a spot, is derived from Old French _Motte_, a clot of earth, probably of Teutonic origin. _Expunge_, in Latin _expungo_, compounded of _ex_ and _pungere_, to prick, signifies to put out by pricking with any sharp instrument. _Erase_, in Latin _erasus_, participle of _erado_ — that is, _e_ and _rado_ found in _abrade_, to scratch out. _Efface_, from _ex_, out, and _fades_, face, means to remove trie face of something. _Cancel_, in French _canceller_, Latin _cancello_, from _cancelli_, lattice-work, signifies to strike out with cross-lines. _Obliterate_, in Latin _obliteratus_, participle of _oblitero_, compounded of _ob_ and _litera_, letter, signifies to cover over letters.  
All these terms obviously refer to characters that are impressed on bodies; the first three apply in the proper sense only to that which is written with the hand, and bespeak the manner in which the action is performed. Letters are _blotted out_, so that they cannot be seen again; they are _expunged_, so as to signify that they cannot stand for anything; they are _erased_, so that the space may be re-occupied with writing. The last three are extended in their application to other characters formed on other substances: _efface_ is general, and does not designate either the manner or the object: inscriptions on stone may be _effaced_, which are rubbed off so as not to be visible: _cancel_ is principally confined to written or printed characters; they are _cancelled_ by striking through them with the pen; in this manner leaves or pages of a book are _cancelled_ which are no longer to be reckoned: _obliterate_ is said of all characters, but without defining the mode in which they are put out; letters are _obliterated_ which are in any way made illegible. _Efface_ applies to images, or the representations of things; in this manner the likeness of a person may be _effaced_ from a statue; _cancel_ respects the subject which is written or printed; _obliterate_ respects the single letters which constitute words. _Efface_ is the consequence of some direct action on the thing which is _effaced;_ in this manner writing may be _effaced_ from a wall by the action of the elements. _cancel_ is the act of a person, and always the fruit of design: _obliterate_ is the fruit of accident and circumstances in general; time itself may _obliterate_ characters on a wall or on paper.  
The metaphorical use of these terms is easily deducible from the preceding explanation; what is figuratively described as written in a book may be said to be _blotted;_ thus our sins are _blotted out_ of the book by the atoning blood of Christ: when the contents of a book are in part rejected, they are aptly described as being _expunged;_ in this manner the freethinking sects _expunge_ everything from the Bible which does not suit their purpose, or they _expunge_ from their creed what does not humor their passions. When the memory is represented, as having characters impressed, they are said to be _erased_ when they are, as it were, directly taken out and occupied by others; in this manner, the recollection of what a child has learned is easily _erased_ by play; and with equal propriety sorrows may be said to _efface_ the recollection of a person's image from the mind. From the idea of striking out or _cancelling_ a debt in an account-book, a debt of gratitude, or an obligation, is said to be _cancelled._ As the lineaments of the face corresponded to written characters, we may say that all traces of his former greatness are _obliterated._

####blow 
**BLOW, STROKE.**  
_Blow_ is a word of obscure history from a Teutonic root meaning to strike. _Stroke_, from the word _strike_, is a substantive allied to the verb _strike_, and denotes the act of striking.  
_Blow_ is used abstractedly to denote the effect of violence; _stroke_ is employed relatively to the person producing that effect. A _blow_ may be received by the carelessness of the receiver or by a pure accident; but _strokes_ are dealt out according to the design of the giver. Children are always in the way of getting _blows_ in the course of their play, and of receiving _strokes_ by way of chastisement. A _blow_ may be given with the hand, or with any flat substance; a _stroke_ is rather a long-drawn _blow_ given with a long instrument, like a stick. _Blows_ may be given with the flat part of a sword, and _strokes_ with a stick.  
_Blow_ is seldom used but in the proper sense; _stroke_ sometimes figuratively, as a _stroke_ of death or a _stroke_ of fortune.

####body 
**BODY, CORPSE, CARCASS.**  
_Body_, Anglo-Saxon _bodig_, is derived from the root meaning to bind, and signifies that which confines the life or spirit. It is here taken in the special sense of dead body. _Corpse_, from Latin _corpus_, body, represents the same kind of specialization — the general word for body being limited to the body in a single state. _Carcass_ has been introduced through French from Italian _carcassa_, a kind of shell, the dead body being an empty shell. The word is ultimately derived from Persian.  
_Body_ is applicable either to men or brutes, _corpse_ to men only, and _carcass_ to brutes only, unless when taken in a contemptuous sense. When speaking of any particular person who is deceased, we should use the simple term _body;_ the _body_ was suffered to lie too long unburied: when designating its condition as lifeless, the term _corpse_ is preferable: he was taken up as a _corpse;_ when designating the body as a lifeless lump separated from the soul, it may be characterized (though contemptuously) as a _carcass;_ the fowls devour the _carcass._

####bold 
**BOLD, FEARLESS, INTREPID, UNDAUNTED.**  
_Bold_ (see [audacity](entry://audacity)). _Fearless_ signifies without fear (see [apprehend](entry://apprehend)). _Intrepid_, compounded of _in_, privative, and _trepidus_, trembling, marks the total absence of fear. _Undaunted_ is the opposite of _daunted, daunt_ being derived from the Latin verb _domitare_, to tame, allied to English _tame. Boldness_ is a positive characteristic of the spirit; _fearlessness_ is a negative state of the mind, that is, simply an absence of fear. A person may be _bold_ through _fearlessness_, but he may be _fearless_ without being _bold;_ he may be _fearless_ where there is no apprehension of danger or no cause for apprehension, but he is _bold_ only when he is conscious or apprehensive of danger, and prepared to encounter it. A man may be _fearless_ in a state of inaction; he is _bold_ only in action, or when in a frame of mind for action.  
_ Interpidity_ is properly a mode of _fearlessness, undauntedness_ a mode of _boldness_ in the highest degree, displayed only on extraordinary occasions; he is _intrepid_ who has no fear where the most fearless might tremble; he is _undaunted_ whose spirit is unabated by that which would make the stoutest heart yield. _Intrepidity_ may be shown either in the bare contemplation of dangers or in the actual encountering of dangers in opposing resistance to force.  
_Undauntedness_ is the opposing actual resistance to a force which is calculated to strike with awe.

####booty 
**BOOTY, SPOIL, PREY.**  
_Booty_ comes through Old French _butin_, from Low German, signifying prey. _Spoil_ is derived from Latin _spolium_, meaning skin stripped off, referring to the stripping off of the dress of a slain warrior. _Prey_ is derived from Latin _prœda_, that which is taken or carried off.  
_Booty_ and _spoil_ are used as military terms in attacks on an enemy, _prey_ in cases of particular violence. The soldier gets his _booty_, the combatant his _spoils_, the carnivorous animal his _prey. Booty_ respects what is of personal service to the captor; _spoils_, whatever serves to designate his triumph; _prey_ includes whatever gratifies the appetite and is to be consumed. When a town is taken, soldiers are too busy in the work of destruction and mischief to carry away much _booty;_ in every battle the arms and personal property of the slain enemy are the lawful _spoils_ of the victor; the hawk pounces on his _prey_ and carries it up to his nest. Greediness stimulates to take _booty;_ ambition produces an eagerness for _spoils;_ a ferocious appetite impels to a search for _prey._ Among the ancients the prisoners of war who were made slaves constituted a part of their _booty;_ and even in later periods such a capture was good _booty_ when ransom was paid for those who could liberate themselves. Among some savages the head or limb of an enemy constituted part of their _spoils._ Among cannibals the prisoners of war are the _prey_ of the conquerors.  
_Booty_ and _prey_ are often used in an extended and figurative sense. Plunderers obtain a rich _booty;_ the diligent bee returns loaded with his _booty._ It is necessary that animals should become a _prey_ to man, in order that man may not become a _prey_ to them; everything in nature becomes a _prey_ to another thing, which in its turn falls a _prey_ to something else. All is changed but order. Man is a _prey_ to the diseases of his body or his mind, and after death to the worms. 

####border 
**BORDER, EDGE, RIM or BRIM, BRINK, MARGIN, VERGE.**  
_Border_, in French _bord_ or _bordure_, Teutonic _bord, is_ probably connected with _bret_, board, signifying a strip in shape like a board. _Edge_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _ecg_, border; and _rim_ from Anglo-Saxon _rima_, which has the same meaning. _Brim_ is a Middle English word which does not appear in Anglo-Saxon, though it has Teutonic parallels. _Brink_ comes from the Scandinavian. _Margin_ is derived from Latin _margo_, a border or brink, cognate with English _mark_, a boundary. _Verge_, French _verge_, from Latin _virga_, at first signified a rod, wand, or hoop; from the sense of rod it came to mean hoop (a bent rod — bent to form a circle), a ring, hence rim or edge.  
Of these terms, _border is_ the least definite point; _edge_ the most so; _rim_ and _brink_ are species of _edge; marain_ and _verge_ are species of _border._ A _border_ is a stripe, an _edge_ is a line. The _border_ lies at a certain distance from the _edge;_ the _edge_ is the exterior termination of the surface of any substance. Whatever is wide enough to admit of any space round its circumference may have a _border_, whatever comes to a narrow extended surface has an _edge._ Many things may have both a _border_ and an _edge;_ of this description are caps, gowns, carpets, and the like; others have a _border_, but no _edge_, as lands; and others have an _edge_, but no _border_, as a knife or a table. A _rim is_ the _edge_ of any vessel; and _brim is_ the exterior _edge_ of a cup; a _brink_ is the _edge_ of any precipice or deep place; a _margin is_ the _border_ of a book or a piece of water; a _verge_ is the extreme _border_ of a place.  
**BORDER, BOUNDARY, FRONTIER, CONFINE, PRECINCT.** — _Border_ (see above). _Boundary_, from Old French _bonne_, a limit, Low Latin _bodina,_ is derived from a Celtic word signifying limit, and is allied to _bourne. Frontier_, French _frontière_, from the Latin _frons_, a forehead, signifies the fore part, or the commencement of anything. _Confine_, in Latin _confinis_, compounded of _con_ or _cum_ and _finis_, an end, signifies an end next to an end. _Precinct_, in Latin _prœcinctum_, participle of _prcecingo_ — that is, _prœ_ and _cingere_, to enclose — signifies any enclosed place.  
_Border, boundary, frontier_, and _confines_ are all applied to countries or tracts of land: the _border_ is the outer edge or tract of land that runs along a country; it is mostly applied to countries running on a fine with each other, as the _borders_ of England and Scotland; the _boundary_ is that which bounds or limits, as the _boundaries_ of countries or provinces; the _frontier is_ that which lies in the front or forms the entrance into a country, as the _frontiers_ of Germany or the _frontiers_ of France; the _confines_ are the parts lying contiguous to others, as the _confines_ of different states or provinces. The term _border_ is employed in describing those parts which form the _borders_, as to dwell on the _borders_, or to run along the _borders._ The term _boundary is_ used in speaking of the extent or limits of places; it belongs to the science of geography to describe the _boundaries_ of countries. The _frontiers_ are mostly spoken of in relation to military matters, as to pass the _frontiers_, to fortify _frontier_ towns, to guard the _frontiers_, or in respect to one's passage from one country to another, as to be stopped at the _frontiers._ The term _confines_, like that of _borders_, is mostly in respect to two places; the _border_ is mostly a line, but the _confines_ may be a point: we therefore speak of going along the _borders_, but meeting on the _confines._  
The term _border_ may be extended in its application to any space, and _boundary_ to any limit. _Confines_ is also figuratively applied to any space included within the _confines_, as the _confines_ of the grave; _precinct_ is properly any space which is encircled by something that serves as a girdle, as to be within the _precincts_ of a court — that is, within the space which belongs to or is under the control of a court.

####both 
**BOTH, PAIR, TWAIN, TWO.**  
_Both_ is a Scandinavian word — a compound of two words. _Bo_, meaning two, corresponds to _bo_ in Latin _ambo_, both, and Greek _άμφω._ The _th_ originally stood for the definite article, as in Gothic _ba tho skipa_, "the two ships. " _Pair_ is derived from Latin _par_, equal, a _pair_ being two equal things that belong together, or that form one single whole. The difference between _two_ and _twain_ was originally one of gender only. All of these words signify two, but there is a difference in their meaning corresponding to the difference in their derivation. _Two_ is the general term; it merely conveys the idea of number. _Twain_ was originally merely another form of _two;_ it is now a poetic word, a trifle more specific than _two_, perhaps. _Both_ contains the idea of the definite article or the demonstrative. It suggests two specific ideas, consciously comprehended in one general statement. To say that there are _two_ books on the table suggests merely the general idea of number. To say that _both_ books are on the table suggests that there are two particular books, distinguished in the mind of the speaker from all other books, and deliberately combined, as it were, in the general idea indicated in the verb. _Pair_ suggests two objects, equal or alike, comprehended in one general idea — two separate and similar things which, taken together, make one whole, such as a _pair_ of gloves, a _pair_ of skates. 

####bound 
**BOUND, LIMIT, CONFINE, CIRCUMSCRIBE, RESTRICT.**  
_Limit_, from the Latin _limes_, a landmark, signifies to draw a line which is to be the exterior line or limit. _Confine_ signifies to bring within _confines. Circumscribe_, in Latin _circumscribo_, is compounded of _circum_ and _scribo_, to write round — that is, to describe a line round. _Restrict_, in Latin _restrictum_, participle of _restringo_, compounded of _re_ and _stringo_, signifies to keep fast back.  
The first four of these terms are employed in the proper sense of parting off certain spaces. _Bound_ applies to the natural or political divisions of the earth: countries are _bounded_ by mountains and sea; kingdoms are often _bounded_ by each other; Spain is _bounded._ on one side by Portugal, on the other side by the Mediterranean, and on a third side by the Pyrenees. _Limit_ applies to any artificial boundary: as landmarks in fields serve to show the _limits_ of one man's ground from another's; so may walls, palings, hedges, or any other visible sign, be converted into a _limit_, to distinguish one spot from another, and in this manner a field is said to be _limited_, because it has _limits_ assigned to it. To _confine_ is to bring the _limits_ close together; to part off one space absolutely from another: in this manner we _confine_ a garden by means of walls. To _circumscribe_ is literally to surround: in this manner a circle may _circumscribe_ a square: there is this difference, however, between _confine_ and _circumscribe_, that the former may not only show the _limits_, but may also prevent egress and ingress; whereas the latter, which is only a fine, is but a simple mark that _limits._  
From the proper acceptation of these terms, we may easily perceive the ground on which their improper acceptation rests: to _bound_ is an action suited to the nature of things, or to some given rule; in this manner our views are _bounded_ by the objects which intercept our sight.  
Or we _bound_ our desires according to the principles of propriety.  
To _limit, confine_, and _circumscribe_ all convey the idea of an action more or less involuntary, and controlled either by circumstances or by persons. To _limit_ is an affair of discretion or necessity; we _limit_ our expenses because we are _limited_ by circumstances.  
Things may be _limited_ to one or many points or objects.  
_Confine_ conveys the same idea to a still stronger degree: what is _confined_ is not only brought within a _limit_, but is kept to that _limit_, which it cannot pass; in this manner a person _confines_ himself to a diet which he finds absolutely necessary for his health, or he is _confined_ in the size of his house, in the choice of his situation, or in other circumstances equally uncontrollable; hence the term _confined_ expresses also the idea of the _limits_ being made narrow as well as impassable or unchangeable. Therefore to _confine_ is properly to bring within narrow _limits;_ it is applied either to space or to the movements of the body or the mind.  
To _circumscribe_ is to _limit_ arbitrarily, or to bring within improper or inconvenient _limits._  
Sometimes _circumscribing_ is a matter of necessity resulting from circumstances, as a person is _circumscribed_ in his means of doing good who cannot do all the good he wishes.  
To _restrict_ is to exercise a stronger degree of control, or to impose a harder necessity, than either of the other terms: a person is _restricted_ by his physician to a certain portion of food in the day. 

####boundary 
See [border](entry://border); [bounds](entry://bounds); [term](entry://term)

####boundless 
**BOUNDLESS, UNBOUNDED, UNLIMITED, INFINITE.**  
_Boundless_, or without _bounds_, is applied to objects which admit of no _bounds_ to be made or conceived by us. _Unbounded_, or _not bounded_, is applied to that which might be _bounded. Unlimited_, or not _limited_, applies to that which might be _limited. Infinite_, or not _finite_, applies to that which in its nature admits of no _bounds._  
The ocean is a _boundless_ object so long as no _bounds_ to it have been discovered; desires are often _unbounded_ which ought always to be _bounded; power_ is sometimes _unlimited_ which would be better _limited;_ nothing is _infinite_ but that Being from whom all _finite_ beings proceed. 

####bounds 
**BOUNDS, BOUNDARY.**  
_Bounds_ and _boundary_, from the verb _bound_, signify the line which sets a _bound_ or marks the extent to which any spot of ground reaches.  
_Bounds_ is employed to designate the whole space, including the outer line that confines: _boundary_ comprehends only this outer line. _Bounds_ are made for a local purpose; _boundary_ for a. political purpose: the master of a school prescribes the _bounds_ beyond which the scholar is not to go; the parishes throughout England have their _boundaries_, which are distinguished by marks; fields have likewise their _boundaries_, which are commonly marked out by a hedge or a ditch. _Bounds_ are temporary and changeable; _boundaries_ permanent and fixed: whoever has the authority of prescribing _bounds_ for others may in like manner contract or extend them at pleasure; the _boundaries_ of places are seldom altered but in consequence of great political changes.  
In the figurative sense _bound_ or _bounds_ is even more frequently used than _boundary;_ we speak of setting _bounds_ or keeping within _bounds_, but to know a _boundary:_ it is necessary occasionally to set _bounds_ to the inordinate appetites of the best disposed children, who cannot be expected to know the exact _boundary_ for indulgence.

####brave 
**BRAVE, GALLANT.**  
_Brave_, French _brave_, originally signified _fine, proud_, inclined to be a braggart; then valiant, allied to Italian _bravo._ The origin is unknown. _Gallant_, Old French _galant_, is a participle of _galer_, to make merry, allied to Italian and Spanish _gala_, which appears in the expression "_gala_ day, " _"gala_ attire. " The early meaning of dashing, spirited, bold, associated with this word is now obsolete in French, but survives in English together with the common French meaning — courteous, courtly, etc.  
These epithets, whether applied to the person or the action, are alike honorable; but the latter is a much stronger expression than the former. _Gallantry_ is extraordinary _bravery_, or _bravery_ on extraordinary occasions: the _brave_ man goes willingly where he is commanded; the _gallant_ man leads on with vigor to the attack. _Bravery_ is common to vast numbers and whole nations; _gallantry_ is peculiar to individuals or particular bodies: the _brave_ man _bravely_ defends the post assigned him; the _gallant_ man volunteers his services in cases of peculiar danger: a man may feel ashamed in not being considered _brave;_ he feels a pride in being looked upon as _gallant._ To call a hero _brave_ adds little or nothing to his character; but to entitle him _gallant_ adds a lustre to the glory he has acquired.  
See also [stalwart](entry://stalwart)  
**BRAVE, DEFY, DARE, CHALLENGE.** — _Brave_, from the epithet _brave_, signifies to act the part of a fearless man. _Defy_, in French _défier_, from Late Latin _diffidare_, from Latin _dis_, apart, and _fides_, faith, means to renounce faith. _Dare_, Anglo-Saxon _ic dearr,_ I dare, is allied to Greek _θαρσειν_, to be bold. _Challenge_, Middle English _chalenge_, was often used in the sense of _claim;_ it is derived from Latin _calumnia_, a false accusation, whence the word _calumny_ is also derived. A _challenge_ meant an invitation to defend one's honor against an accusation by fighting.  
To _brave_ is with bravery to resist or meet the force of any opposing power: as the sailor _braves_ the tempestuous ocean, or, in the bad sense, a man _braves_ the scorn and reproach of the world; so things personified may _brave._  
To _defy_ is to hold cheap that which opposes itself as it respects persons; there is often much insolent resistance in _defiance_, as a man _defies_ the threats of his superior.  
In respect to things it denotes a resolution to bear whatever may be inflicted.  
To _dare_ and to _challenge_ have more of provocation than resistance in them; he who _dares_ and _challenges_ provokes or calls on another to do something. To _dare_ is an informal act, performed either by words or deeds; as to _dare_ a person to come out, to _dare_ him to leave his place of retreat: to _challenge_ is a formal act, performed by words; as to _challenge_ another to fight, or to engage in any contest.  
_Daring_ may sometimes be performed by actions, and _braving_ sometimes by words; so that by the poets they are occasionally used one for the other.  
**BRAVERY, COURAGE, VALOR.** — _Bravery_ denotes the abstract quality of _brave. Courage_, in French _courage_, comes from _cœur_, in Latin _cor_, the heart, which is the seat of _courage. Valor_, in French _valeur_, Latin _valor_, from _valere_, to be strong, signifies by distinction strength  
_Bravery_ lies in the blood; _courage_ lies in the mind; the latter depends on the reason, the former on the physical temperament: the first is a species of instinct; the second is a virtue: a man is _brave_ in proportion as he is without thought; he has _courage_ in proportion as he reasons or reflects. _Bravery_ is of utility only in the hour of attack or contest; _courage_ is of service at all times and under all circumstances: _bravery_ is of avail in overcoming the obstacle of the moment; _courage_ seeks to avert the distant evil that may possibly arrive. _Bravery_ is a thing of the moment — that is or is not, as circumstances may favor; it varies with the time and season: _courage_ exists at all times and on all occasions. The _brave_ man who fearlessly rushes to the mouth of the cannon may tremble at his own shadow as he passes through a churchyard or turn pale at the sight of blood: the _courageous_ man smiles at imaginary dangers, and prepares to meet those that are real. It is as possible for a man to have _courage_ without _bravery_ as to have _bravery_ without _courage._ Cicero showed no marks of personal _bravery_ as a commander, but he displayed his _courage_ when he laid open the treasonable purposes of Catiline to the whole senate, and charged him to his face with the crimes of which he knew him to be guilty.  
_Valor_ is a higher quality than either _bravery_ or _courage_, and seems to partake of the grand characteristics of both: combines the fire of _bravery_ with the determination and firmness of _courage: bravery_ is most fitted for the soldier and all who receive orders; _courage_ is most adapted for the general and all who give command; _valor_ for the leader and framer of enterprises and all who carry great projects into execution: _bravery_ requires to be guided; _courage_ is equally fitted to command or obey; _valor_ directs and executes. _Bravery_ has most relation to danger; _courage_ and _valor_ include in them a particular reference to action: the _brave_ man exposes himself; the _courageous_ man advances to the scene of action which is before him; the _valiant_ man seeks for occasions to act. The three hundred Spartans who defended the Straits of Thermopylae were _brave._ Socrates drinking the hemlock, Regulus returning to Carthage, Titus tearing himself from the arms of the weeping Berenice, Alfred the Great going into the camp of the Danes, were _courageous._ Hercules destroying monsters, Perseus delivering Andromeda, Achilles running to the ramparts of Troy, and the knights of more modern date who have gone in quest of extraordinary adventures, are all entitled to the peculiar appellation of _valiant._

####breach 
**BREACH, BREAK, GAP, CHASM.**  
_Breach_ and _break are_ both derived from the same verb _break_ (see [break](entry://break)), to denote what arises from being broken, in the figurative sense of the verb itself. _Gap is_ a Scandinavian word allied to _gape_, signifying that which gapes or stands open. _Chasm_ (Latin _chasma_, a gulf, which is a transliteration of Greek _χάσμα_, a yawning cleft, allied to _χαός_, chaos) has a similar meaning.  
The idea of an opening is common to these terms, but they differ in the nature of the opening. A _breach_ and a _gap_ are the consequence of a violent removal which destroys the connection; a _break_ and a _chasm_ may arise from the absence of that which would form a connection. A _breach_ in a wall is made by means of cannon; _gaps_ in fences are commonly the effect of some violent effort to pass through; a _break_ is made in a page of printing by leaving off in the middle of a line; a _chasm_ is left in writing when any words in the sentence are omitted. A _breach_ and a _chasm_ always imply a larger opening than a _break_ or _gap._ A _gap_ may be made in a knife; a _breach_ is always made in the walls of a building or fortification: the clouds sometimes separate so as to leave small _breaks;_ the ground is sometimes so convulsed by earthquakes as to leave frightful _chasms. Breach, chasm_, and _gap_ are figuratively applied to other objects with the same distinction; as a _breach_ of friendship or of domestic harmony; a _gap_ in nature or time; and a _chasm_ in our enjoyments. 

####break 
**BREAK, RACK, REND, TEAR.**  
_Break_, Anglo-Saxon _brecan_, is a Germanic word signifying to crack with a noise. _Rack_ is a variant of _wrack_, allied to Anglo-Saxon _wrecan_ (Modern English _wreck)_, to drive, urge: it refers especially to something driven ashore, hence to anything broken in pieces, like a ship crushed on the rocks in a storm. _Rend_, Northern French _renne_, to tear apart, has few cognates outside of English. _Tear_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _teran_, to rend.  
The forcible division of any substance is the common characteristic of these terms. _Break_ is the generic term, the rest are specific: everything _racked, rent_, or _torn_ is broken, but not _vice versa. Break_ has, however, a specific meaning, in which it is comparable with the others. _Breaking_ requires less violence than either of the others, brittle things may be _broken_ with the slightest touch, but nothing can be _racked_ without intentional violence of an extraordinary kind. Glass is quickly _broken;_ a table is _racked._ Hard substances only are _broken_ or _racked;_ but everything of a soft texture and composition may be _rent_ or _torn. Breaking_ is performed by means of a blow; _racking_ by that of a violent concussion or straining; but _rending_ and _tearing_ are the consequences of a pull or a sudden snatch. Anything of wood or stone is _broken;_ anything of a complicated structure, with hinges and joints, is _racked;_ cloth is _rent_, paper is _torn. Rend_ is sometimes used for what is done by design; a _tear_ is always faulty. _Cloth_ is sometimes _rent_ rather than cut when it is wanted to be divided; but when it is _torn_ it is injured. To _tear_ is also used in the sense not only of dividing by violence that which ought to remain whole, but by separating one object from another; as to _tear_ anything off or out, etc.  
In the moral or figurative application, _break_ denotes in general a division or separation more or less violent of that which ought to be united or bound; as to _break_ a tie, to _break_ an engagement or promise. To _rack_ is a continued action; as to _rack_ the feelings, to place them in a violent state of tension. To _rend_ is figuratively applied in the same sense as in the proper application, to denote a sudden division of what has been before whole; as to _rend_ the heart, to have it pierced or divided, as it were, with grief; so likewise to _rend_ the air with shouts. To _tear_ is metaphorically separating objects from one another which are united; as to _tear_ one's self from the company of a friend.  
**BREAK, BRUISE, SQUEEZE, POUND, CRUSH.** — _Break_ (see above). _Bruise_, Anglo-Saxon _brysan_ in the compound _to-brysan_, to bruise, is also found in Old French _bruiser_, to break. It may be a Celtic word. _Squeeze_, Late Middle English _queisan_, is derived from _ex_, and Anglo-Saxon _cwiesan_, to crush. _Pound_, from Anglo-Saxon _punian_, to _pound_, is allied to Dutch _puin_, rubbish, hash, or "a cyment of stones, " and Low German _pun_, chips of stones. _Crush_, Old French _crusir_, to crack or break, is derived from a Teutonic root signifying to gnash with the teeth.  
_Break_ always implies the separation of the component parts of a body; _bruise_ denotes simply the destroying the continuity of the parts. Hard, brittle substances, as glass, are _broken;_ soft, pulpy substances, as flesh or fruits, are _bruised._ The operation of _bruising_ is performed either by a violent blow or by pressure; that of _squeezing_ by compression only. Metals, particularly lead and silver, may be _bruised;_ fruits may be either _bruised_ or _squeezed._ In this latter sense _bruise_ applies to the harder substances, or indicates a violent compression; _squeeze_ is used for soft substances or a gentle compression. The kernels of nuts are _bruised;_ oranges or apples are _squeezed._ To_ pound_ is properly to _bruise_ in a mortar, so as to produce a separation of parts; to _crush_ is the most violent and destructive of all operations, which amounts to the total dispersion of all the parts of a body. What is _broken_ may be made whole again; what is _bruised_ or _squeezed_ may be restored to its former tone and consistency; what is _pounded_ is only reduced to smaller parts for convenience; but what is _crushed_ is destroyed. When the wheel of a carriage passes over any body that yields to its weight, it _crushes_ it to powder.  
In the figurative sense, _crush_ marks a total annihilation: if a conspiracy be not _crushed_ in the bud, it will prove fatal to the power which has suffered it to grow.  
_Break, Burst, (Crack, Split. — Break_ (see preceding). _Burst_, Anglo-Saxon _berstan_, is a Teutonic word signifying to break asunder. _Crack_, Anglo-Saxon _cracian_, to crack, is apparently an imitative word representing a sudden breaking asunder. _Split_ is apparently borrowed from Middle Dutch _splitten;_ it. signifies a form of breaking.  
_Break_ is the general term, denoting any separation or coming apart with more or less force; the rest are particular modes, varied either in the circumstances of the action or the object acted upon. To _break_ does not specify any particular manner or form of action; what is _broken_ may be _broken_ in two or more pieces, _broken_ short or lengthwise, and the like: to _burst_ is to _break_ suddenly and with violence, frequently also with noise.  
Everything that is exposed to external violence, particularly hard substances, are said to be _broken;_ but hollow bodies, or such as are exposed to tension, are properly said to _burst._  
In the sense of making way or opening the same distinction is preserved.  
To _crack_ and _split_ are modes of _breaking_ lengthwise: the former in application to hard or brittle objects, as clay, or the things made of clay; the latter in application to wood, or that which is made of wood. _Breaking_ frequently causes an entire separation of the component parts so as to destroy the things; _cracking_ and _splitting_ are but partial separations.

####breed 
**BREED, ENGENDER.**  
_Breed_ signifies to produce or cherish a _brood_, a Teutonic word from a root meaning heat or warmth, _breed_ being suggestive of fostering warmth. _Engender_, from Latin _in_, in, and _generare_, from _gener_, stem of _genus_, race, means to produce a race.  
These terms are properly employed for the act of procreation. To _breed_ is to bring into existence by a slow operation: to _engender_ is to be the author or prime cause of existence. So, in the metaphorical sense, frequent quarrels are apt to _breed_ hatred and animosity: the leveling and inconsistent conduct of the higher classes in. the present age serves to _engender_ a spirit of insubordination and assumption in the inferior order. Whatever _breeds_ acts gradually; whatever _engenders_ produces immediately as cause and effect. Uncleanliness _breeds_ diseases of the body; want of occupation _breeds_ those of the mind; playing at chance games _engenders_ a love of money.

####breeze 
**BREEZE, GALE, BLAST, GUST, STORM, TEMPEST, HURRICANE.**  
All these words express the action of the wind, in different degrees and under different circumstances. _Breeze_, in Italian _brezza_, is in all probability an onomatopoeia for that kind of wind peculiar to Southern climates. _Gale_ is a Scandinavian word possibly allied to Danish _gal_, furious, and derived from the root found in Modern English _yell. Blast_, Anglo-Saxon _blœst_, signifies a blowing. _Gust_ is allied to the verb _gush_, signifying a wind which _gushes_ out, a sudden blast. _Storm_ is a Germanic word from the root whence _stir_ is also derived, and signifies a great stirring up of the elements. _Tempest_, in Latin _tempestas_, or _tempus_, a time or season, describes that season or sort of weather which is most remarkable, but at the same time most frequent, in Southern climates. _Hurricane_ has been introduced by the Spaniards into European languages from the Caribbee Islands, where it describes that species of _tempestuous_ wind most frequent in tropical climates.  
A _breeze_ is gentle; a _gale_ is brisk, but steady; we have _breezes_ in a calm summer's day; the mariner has favorable _gales_, which keep the sails on the stretch. A _blast_ is impetuous: the exhalations of a trumpet, the breath of bellows, the sweep of a violent wind, are _blasts._ A _gust_ is sudden and vehement; _gusts_ of wind are sometimes so violent as to sweep everything before them while they last. _Storm, tempest_, and _hurricane_ include other particulars besides wind. A _storm_ throws the whole atmosphere into commotion; it is a war of the elements, in which wind, rain, hail, and the like conspire to disturb the heavens. _Tempest_ is a species of _storm_ which has also thunder and lightning to add to the confusion. _Hurricane_ is a species of _storm_ which exceeds all the rest in violence and duration.  
_Gust, storm_, and _tempest_, which are applied figuratively, preserve their distinction in this sense. The passions are exposed to _gusts_ and _storms_, to sudden bursts, or violent and continued agitations; the soul is exposed to _tempests_ when agitated with violent and contending emotions.

####brightness 
**BRIGHTNESS, LUSTRE, SPLENDOR, BRILLIANCY.**  
_Brightness_, from Anglo-Saxon _beorht_, shining, is allied to Greek _φορκός_, white. _Lustre_ is derived from Late Latin _lustrum_, a window, Italian _lustro_, "a lustre, a glasse, a shining" (Florio), which comes ultimately from Latin _lucere_, to shine. _Splendor_, in French _splendeur_, is derived from Latin _splendor_, from _splendere_, to shine. _Brilliancy_, from French _briller_, to shine, comes from the Latin of the Middle Ages _beryllus_, a crystal.  
_Brightness_ is the generic, the rest are specific terms: there cannot be _lustre, splendor_, and _brilliancy_ without _brightness;_ but there may be _brightness_ where these do not exist. These terms rise in sense; _lustre_ rises on _brightness, splendor_ on _lustre_, and _brilliancy_ on _splendor. Brightness_ and _lustre_ are applied properly to natural lights; _splendor_ and _brilliancy_ have been more commonly applied to that which is artificial or unusual: there is always more or less _brightness_ in the sun or moon; there is an occasional _lustre_ in all the heavenly bodies when they shine in their unclouded _brightness;_ there is _splendor_ in the eruptions of flame from a volcano or an immense conflagration; there is _brilliancy_ in a collection of diamonds. There may be both _splendor_ and _brilliancy_ in an illumination: the _splendor_ arises from the mass and richness of light; the _brilliancy_ from the variety and _brightness_ of the lights and colors. _Brightness_ may be obscured, _lustre_ may be tarnished, _splendor_ and _brilliancy_ diminished.  
The analogy is closely preserved in the figurative application. _Brightness_ attaches to the moral character of men in ordinary cases, _lustre_ attaches to extraordinary instances of virtue and greatness, _splendor_ and _brilliancy_ attach to the achievements of men. Our Saviour is strikingly represented to us as the _brightness_ of his Father's glory and the express image of His person. The humanity of the English in the hour of conquest adds a _lustre_ to their victories, which are either _splendid_ or _brilliant_, according to the number and nature of the circumstances which render them remarkable.

####bring 
**BRING, FETCH, CARRY.**  
_Bring_, Anglo-Saxon _bringan_, is a widely distributed Germanic word. _Fetch_, Anglo-Saxon _feccan_, to fetch, is allied to _fœt_, a pace, a step, and Latin pes, a foot; and meant to go to get something. _Carry_ (see [bear](entry://bear); [carry](entry://carry)).  
To _bring_ is simply to take with one's self from the place where one is; to _fetch_ is to go first to a place and then _bring_ a thing; to _fetch_, therefore, is a species of _bringing;_ whatever is near at hand is _brought;_ whatever is at a distance must be _fetched:_ the porter at an inn _brings_ a parcel, a servant who is sent for it _fetches_ it. _Bring_ always respects motion toward the place in which the speaker resides; _fetch_, a motion both to and from; _carry_, always a motion directly from the place or at a distance from the place. A servant _brings_ the parcel home which his master has sent him to _fetch;_ he _carries_ a parcel from home. A _carrier carries_ parcels to and from a place, but he does not _bring_ parcels to and from any place. _Bring_ is an action performed at the option of the agent; _fetch_ and _carry_ are mostly done at the command of another. Hence the old proverb, "He who will _fetch_ will _carry, "_ to mark the character of the gossip and tale-bearer, who reports what he hears from two persons in order to please both parties.

####brook 
**BROOK, BEAR, ENDURE, STAND.**  
_Brook_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _brucan_, to enjoy. For the derivations of _bear_ and _endure_, see [bear](entry://bear). For the derivation of _stand_ see that key-word. The term applies generally to the attitude of a person toward others. We _bear_ with the company or actions of another whom we may dislike, from the impulse of politeness or policy, with conditions that are uncongenial because they are forced upon us or are unavoidable by us; we _endure_, or put up with, people, conditions, and objects because we are obliged to do so, or because it would not be convenient or prudent for us to do otherwise: and for similar reasons we permit or allow things to be said or done that are distasteful. The term _stand_, colloquially, has a very intimate relation to _brook_, as we say we will _brook_ no delay, interference, postponement, and the like, in matters that concern us closely, implying that we will not _stand_, permit, or put up with any such actions.

####build 
**BUILD, ERECT, CONSTRUCT.**  
_Build_, Anglo-Saxon _byldan_, is allied to _bold_, a house, Icelandic _bol_, a house, etc., and signifies the making of a house. _Erect_, in French _ériger_, Latin _erectus_, participle of _erigere_, means to set up straight. _Construct_, in Latin _constructus_, participle of _construe_, compounded of _con_, together, and _struere_, to pile or put, signifies to build by piling stones one on top of another, etc.  
The word _build_ by distinction expresses the purpose of the action; _ereci_ indicates the mode of the action; _construct_ indicates contrivance in the action. What is _built_ is employed for the purpose of receiving, retaining, or confining; what is _erected_ is placed in an elevated situation; what is _constructed_ is put together with ingenuity. All that is _built_ may be said to be _erected_ or _constructed;_ but all that is _erected_ or _constructed_ is not said to be _built;_ likewise what is _erected_ is mostly _constructed_, though not _vice versa._ We _build_ from necessity; we _erect_ for ornament; we _construct_ for utility and convenience. Houses are _built_, monuments _erected_, machines are _constructed._

####bulky 
**BULKY, MASSIVE.**  
_Bulky_ denotes having _bulk_, from a root signifying to swell, which appeal's in _bowl, bulge, belly_, etc. It is a Scandinavian word. _Massive_, in French _massif_, from _mass_, signifies having a mass or being like a _mass_, which is in the German _masse_, Latin _massa_, Greek _μάζα_, dough, from _μάσσειν_, to knead, signifying made into a solid substance.  
Whatever is _bulky_ has a prominence of figure; what is _massive_ has compactness of matter. The _bulky_, therefore, though larger in size, is not so weighty as the _massive._ Hollow bodies frequently have _bulk;_ none but solid bodies can be _massive._ A vessel is _bulky_ in its form; lead, silver, and gold are _massive._

**BUNGLE, BOTCH, MISMANAGE, SPOIL.**  
_Bungle_, a word of imitative origin, signifies in ordinary language to do anything clumsily, to mismanage, or execute badly an affair through ignorance, clumsiness, or awkwardness. _Botch_, a word of imitative origin allied to _patch_, a piece of work, means to put together carelessly, as a patch on anything, or a part of any work so finished that it looks worse than the rest or unbecoming to it. _Spoil_ means to render useless, to disfigure beyond recognition, to mar, damage, or ruin anything, or by careless work to cause an object to deteriorate in appearance or value.

####burial 
**BURIAL, INTERMENT, SEPULTURE.**  
_Burial_, allied to _bury_, Anglo-Saxon _byrigan_, is derived from _beorgan_, to hide, and means to hide in the ground. _Interment_, from _inter_, compounded of _in_, and _terra_, signifies the putting into the ground. _Sepulture_, in French _sépulture_, Latin _sepultura_, is derived from _sepelire_, to bury.  
Under _burial_ is comprehended simply the purpose of the action; under _interment_ and _sepulture_, the manner as well as the motive of the action. We _bury_ in order to conceal; _interment_ and _sepulture_ are accompanied with religious ceremonies. _Bury_ is confined to no object or place; we _bury_ whatever we deposit in the earth, and wherever we please; but _interment_ and _sepulture_ respect only the bodies of the deceased when deposited in a sacred place. _Burial_ requires that the object be concealed under ground; _interment_ may be used for depositing in vaults. Self-murderers were formerly _buried_ in the highways; Christians in general are _buried_ in the churchyard; but the kings of England were formerly _interred_ in Westminster Abbey. _Burial_ is a term in familiar use; _interment_ serves frequently as a more elegant expression; _sepulture_ is an abstract term confined to particular cases, as in speaking of the rites and privileges of _sepulture._

####business 
**BUSINESS, OCCUPATION, EMPLOYMENT, ENGAGEMENT, AVOCATION.**  
_Business_ signifies that which makes _busy_ (see [active](entry://active)). _Occupation_, from Latin _occupare_, compounded of _ob_, near, and _capere_, to take, signifies that which serves or takes possession of a person or thing to the exclusion of other things. _Employment_, in French _emploi_, is derived from Latin _implico_ (whence _implicate)_, signifying to enfold, _employment_ being that which enfolds one, shuts one off from other activities; compare the phrase "wrapped up in his work" for a similar metaphor. _Engagement_ (see [attract](entry://attract)). _Avocation_, in Latin _avocatio_, from _a._ away, and _vocare_, to call, signifies the thing that calls off from another thing.  
_Business_ occupies all a person's thoughts as well as his time and powers; _occupation_ and _employment_ occupy only his time and strength: the first is mostly regular, it is the object of our choice; the second is casual, it depends on the will of another. _Engagement_ is a partial _employment, avocation_ a particular _engagement:_ an _engagement_ prevents us from doing anything else; an _avocation_ calls off or prevents us from doing what we wish. Every tradesman has a _business_, on the diligent prosecution of which depends his success in life; every mechanic has his daily _occupation_, by which he maintains his family; every laborer has an _employment_ which is fixed for him. _Business_ and _occupation_ always suppose a serious object. _Business_ is something more urgent and important than _occupation:_ a man of independent fortune has no occasion to pursue _business_, but as a rational agent he will not be contented to be without an _occupation. Employment, engagement_, and _avocation_ leave the object undefined. An _employment_ may be a mere diversion of the thought and a wasting of the hours in some idle pursuit; a child may have its _employment_, which may be its play in distinction from its _business:_ an _engagement_ may have no higher object than that of pleasure; the idlest people have often the most _engagements;_ the gratification of curiosity and the love of social pleasure supply them with an abundance of _engagements. Avocations_ have seldom a direct trifling object, although it may sometimes be of a subordinate nature, and generally irrelevant: numerous _avocations_ are not desirable; every man should have a fixed pursuit, as the _business_ of his life, to which the principal part of his time should be devoted: _avocations_, therefore, of a serious nature are apt to divide the time and attention to a hurtful degree.  
A person who is _busy_ has much to attend to, and attends to it, closely: a person who is _occupied_ has a full share of _business_ without any pressure; he is opposed to one who is idle: a person who is _employed_ has the present moment filled up; he is not in a state of inaction: the person who is _engaged_ is not at liberty to be otherwise _employed;_ his time is not his own; he is opposed to one at leisure.  
**BUSINESS, TRADE, PROFESSION, ART.** — _Business_ (see above). _Trade_ signifies that which employs the time by way of _trade. Profession_ signifies that which one professes to do. _Art_ signifies that which is followed in the way of the _arts._  
These words are synonymous in the sense of a calling for the purpose of a livelihood: _business_ is general, _trade_ and _profession_ are particular; all _trade_ is _business_, but all _business_ is not _trade._ Buying and selling of merchandise is inseparable from _trade;_ but the exercise of one's knowledge and experience for purposes of gain constitutes a _business:_ when learning or particular skill is required, it is a _profession;_ and when there is a peculiar exercise of _art_, it is an _art;_ every shopkeeper and retail dealer carries on a _trade;_ brokers, manufacturers, bankers, and others carry on _business;_ clergymen, medical or military men follow a _profession;_ musicians and painters follow an _art._  
**BUSINESS, OFFICE, DUTY.** — _Business_ (see above). _Office_ (see [benefit](entry://benefit)). _Duty_ signifies what is due or owing one, based on French _du_, Latin _debitum_, participle of _debere_, to owe.  
_Business_ is that which engages the time, talents, and interest of a man; it is what a man proposes to himself: _office_ is that which a man is called upon to do for another; it is consequently prescribed by others: _duly_ is that which duty prescribes: one follows _business_, fills or discharges an _office_, and performs or discharges a _duty._ As _business_ is the concern of the individual, and _duty_ is his duty, these terms properly apply to private matters as the _business_ or _duties_ of life: _office_, on the other hand, being that which is done for the benefit or by the direction of others, is properly applied to public matters.  
But the terms may be so qualified that the former may be applied to public, and the latter to private matters.  
_Business_ and _office_ are frequently applied to that part which a man is called to perform; in which sense _business_ and _office_ come still nearer to the term _duty;_ what belongs to a person to do or see done, that is properly his _business:_ a person is bound, either by the nature of his engagements or by private and personal engagements or private and personal motives, to perform a service for another, as the _office_ of a prime minister, the _office_ of a friend; that is his _office. Duty_ in this application expresses a stronger obligation than either of the other terms; where the service is enjoined by law, or commanded by the person, that is a _duty_, as the clerical _duties_, the _duty_ of a soldier. See also [affair](entry://affair)

####bustle 
**BUSTLE, TUMULT, UPROAR.**  
_Bustle_ is a Scandinavian word, a frequentative of the Norwegian _busta_, to be violent, and related to Icelandic _bustla_, to splash about like a fish, and to English _boast, boisterous_, etc. _Tumult_, Latin _tumultus_, is derived from Latin _tumere_, to swell, surge up, whence _tumor_ is also derived. _Uproar_ is derived from Dutch _op_, up, and _roeren_, to excite, stir, move, and signified originally a stirring up; but its meaning has been influenced by its similarity to English _roar. Bustle_ has most of hurry in it; _tumult_ most of disorder and confusion; _uproar_ most of noise: the hurried movements of one, or many, cause a _bustle;_ the disorderly struggles of many constitute a _tumult;_ the loud elevation of many opposing voices produces an _uproar. Bustle_ is frequently not the effect of design, but the natural consequence of many persons coming together; _tumult_ commonly arises from a general effervescence in the minds of a multitude; _uproar_ is the consequence either of general anger or mirth. A crowded street will always be in a _bustle;_ contested elections are always accompanied with a great _tumult;_ drinking-parties make a considerable _uproar_, in the indulgence of their intemperate mirth.

####but 
**BUT, EXCEPT.**  
As a conjunction _but_ implies something more to supply, unless, yet, nevertheless, than, and otherwise than, and is used where a second sentence or clause is in opposition to the one preceding it, to arrest an inference which the first sentence or clause would otherwise have suggested. As an adverb, it implies only; as a proposition, technically, a term of separation or exclusion, it signifies excepting; as an interjection it expresses surprise or dissent; as a substantive, a hindrance or impediment, also the outer room of a house of two or more apartments where the inner room is entered from the other. In logic, _but_ is the connecting word which introduces the minor term of a syllogism; in mathematics, it denotes what is assumed or proved.  
As a conjunction _but_ is a synonyme of _yet. Yet_ denotes a stronger degree of opposition than _but._ As a preposition _but_ is a synonyme of _except._ There is little difference in meaning between the two prepositions. _Except_ is somewhat clearer and more emphatic, and may be used to introduce not merely a noun but a noun clause.

####buy 
**BUY, PURCHASE, BARGAIN, CHEAPEN.**  
_Buy_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _bycgan_, to buy. _Purchase_ comes from Old French _pour_ (Latin _pro)_ and _chacer_, to chase, and signifies to hunt for eagerly. _Bargain_ is derived from Late Latin _barcaniare_, to change about, to chaffer; its remoter origin is unknown. _Cheapen_, from Anglo-Saxon _ceap_, price, meant to price, and then to seek to obtain for a small price.  
_Buy_ and _purchase_ have a strong resemblance to each other, both in sense and application; but the latter is a term of more refinement than the former: _buy_ may always be substituted for _purchase_ without impropriety; but _purchase_ would be sometimes ridiculous in the familiar application of _buy:_ the necessaries of fife are _bought;_ luxuries are _purchased._ The characteristic idea of _buying_ is that of expending money according to a certain rule and for a particular purpose; that of _purchasing_ is the procuring the thing by any means; some things, therefore, may more properly be said to be _purchased_ than _bought_, as to _purchase_ friends, ease, and the like.  
_Buying_ implies simply the exchange of one's money for a commodity; _bargaining_ and _cheapening_ have likewise respect to the price: to _bargain_ is to make a specific agreement as to the price; to _cheapen_ is not only to lower the price asked, but to deal in such things as are _cheap:_ trade is supported by _buyers; bargainers_ and _cheapeners_ are not acceptable customers: mean people are prone to _bargaining_, poor people are obliged to _cheapen._

####bygone 
**BYGONE, PAST.**  
_Bygone_, a compound of the English _by_, near, from, after, and _gone_, departed, moved, as an adjective implies gone by, passed or past, and as a substantive, things that have disappeared, passed away, become lost to sight and, in a sense, to memory. From this we have the familiar phrase _let bygones be bygones_, implying let the past be forgotten, doubtless from the old form, _byganes suld be byganes_, the past should not be brought up against one. As an adjective _bygone_ does not really differ in meaning from _past._ But post is a prosaic word; it merely indicates a fact or a condition. _Bygone_ has a pensive, poetic, slightly archaic quality.

####calamity 
**CALAMITY, DISASTER, MISFORTUNE, MISCHANCE, MISHAP.**  
_Calamity_ comes from Latin _calamitas_, misfortune; its ultimate origin is unknown. _Disaster_, in French _désastre_, is compounded of the privative _des_ or _dis_ and _astre_, in Latin _astrum_, a star, signifying what comes from the adverse influence of the stars. _Misfortune, mischance_, and _mishap_ naturally express what comes amiss by fortune or chance.  
The idea of a painful event is common to all these terms, but they differ in the degree of impatience. A _calamity_ is a great _disaster_ or _misfortune;_ a _misfortune_, a great _mischance_ or _mishap:_ whatever is attended with destruction is a _calamity;_ whatever is accompanied with a loss of property, or the deprivation of health, is a _misfortune;_ whatever diminishes the beauty or utility of objects is a _mischance_ or _mishap:_ the devastation of a country by hurricanes or earthquakes, and the desolation of its inhabitants by famine or plague, are great _calamities;_ the overturning of a carriage, and the fracture of a limb, are _disasters;_ losses in trade are _misfortunes;_ the spoiling of a book is, to a greater or less extent, a _mischance_ or _mishap._ A _calamity_ seldom arises from the direct agency of man; the elements, or the natural course of things, are mostly concerned in producing this source of misery to men; the rest may be ascribed to chance, as distinguished from design: _disasters_ mostly arise from some specific known cause, either the carelessness of persons or the unfitness of things for their use; as they generally serve to derange some preconcerted scheme or undertaking, they seem as if they were produced by some secret influence: _misfortune_ is frequently assignable to no specific cause; it is the bad fortune of an individual; a link in the chain of his destiny; an evil independent of himself, as distinguished from a fault: _mischance_ and _mishap_ are_ misfortunes_ of comparatively so trivial a nature that it would not be worth while to inquire into their cause or to dwell upon their consequences. A _calamity_ is dreadful, a _disaster_ melancholy, a _misfortune_ grievous or heavy, a _mischance_ or _mishap_ slight or trivial. 

####calculate 
**CALCULATE, RECKON, COMPUTE, COUNT.**  
_Calculate_, in Latin _calculatus_, participle of _calcula_, comes from _calculus_, Greek κάλιξ, a pebble; because the Greeks gave their votes, and the Romans made out their accounts, by little stones; hence it denotes the action itself of _reckoning. Reckon_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _gerecnian_, to explain, from _reccan_ to rule, order, direct, and refers to an orderly process of thought — to the directing and ordering of one's thoughts or plans. _Compute_, in French _computer_, Latin _computo_, compounded of _com_ and _puto_, signifies to put together in one's mind. _Count_, in French _compter_, is but a contraction of _computer._  
These words indicate the means by which we arrive at a certain result in regard to quantity. To _calculate_ is the generic term; the rest denote modes of _calculating_ to _calculate_ denotes any numerical operation in general, but is particularly applicable to the abstract science of figures; the astronomer _calculates_ the motions of the heavenly bodies; the mathematician makes algebraic _calculations:_ to _reckon_ is to enumerate and set down things in detail; _reckoning_ is applicable to the ordinary business of life: tradesmen keep their accounts by _reckoning;_ children learn to _reckon_ by various simple processes. _Calculation_ is therefore the science, _reckoning_ the practical art of enumerating.  
To _compute_ is to come at the result by _calculation;_ it is a sort of numerical estimate drawn from different sources: historians and chronologists _compute_ the times of particular events by comparing them with those of other known events. An almanac is made by _calculation, computation_, and _reckoning._ The rising and setting of the heavenly bodies are _calculated;_ from given astronomical tables is _computed_ the moment on which any celestial phenomenon may return; and by _reckoning_ are determined the days on which holidays, or other periodical events, fall.  
To _count_ is as much as to take account of, and when used as a mode of _calculation_ it signifies the same as to _reckon_ one by one; as to _count_ one by one, to _count_ the hours or minutes.  
These words are all employed in application to moral objects, to denote the estimate which the mind takes of things. To _calculate_ is to look to future events and their probable consequences; we _calculate_ on a gain, on an undertaking, or any enterprise: to _compute_ is to look to that which is past and what results from any past event, as to _compute_ a loss, or the amount of any mischief done: to _reckon_ is either to look at that which is present, and to set an estimate upon it; as to _reckon_ a thing cheap; or to look to that which is future as something desirable, as to _reckon_ on a promised pleasure. To _count_ is to look on the thing that is present, and to set a value upon it according to circumstances, as to _count_ a thing for nothing. A spirit of _calculation_ arises from the cupidity engendered by trade; it narrows the mind to the mere prospect of accumulation and self-interest. _Computations_ are inaccurate that are not founded upon exact numerical _calculations._ Inconsiderate people are apt to _reckon_ on things that are very uncertain, and then lay up to themselves a store of disappointments. Those who have experienced the instability of human affairs will never _calculate_ on an hour's enjoyment beyond the moment of existence. It is difficult to _compute_ the loss which an army sustains upon being defeated, especially if it be obliged to make a long retreat. Those who know the human heart will never _reckon_ on the assistance of professed friends in the hour of adversity. Men often _count_ their lives as nothing in the prosecution of a favorite scheme. 

####calendar 
**CALENDAR, ALMANAC, EPHEMERIS.**  
_Calendar_, Latin _calendarium_, was originally an account book kept by money-changers, so called because interest was due on the first of the month, which was termed the _Calendœ. Almanac_ is a word of unknown origiii which appears in Latin in the thirteenth century, and shortly after that in most of the Romance languages. It may be derived from an Arabic root signifying to reckon. _Ephemeris_, in Greek _έφημερίς_, from _έπί_ and _ήμερα_, the day, implies that which happens by the day.  
These terms denote a date-book, but the _calendar_ is a book which registers events under every month: the _almanac_ is a book which registers times, or the divisions of the year: and an _ephemeris_ is a book which registers the planetary movements every day. An _almanac_ may be a _calendar_ and an _ephemeris_ may be both an _almanac_ and a _calendar;_ but every _almanac_ is not a _calendar_, nor every _calendar_ an _almanac._ The Gardener's _Calendar_ is not an _almanac_, and the sheet _almanacs_ are seldom _calendars:_ likewise the Nautical _Ephemeris_ may serve as an _almanac_, although not as a _calendar._

####call 
**CALL, CRY, EXCLAIM.**  
_Call_ is a word of Scandinavian origin, and signifies simply the raising of the voice. _Cry_, French, _crier_, Italian _gridare_, is derived from Latin _quiritare_, to shriek or lament, originally signifying to implore the aid of the _Quirites_, or Roman citizens. _Exclaim_ is derived from the Latin _ex_ and _clamare_, to cry out; both denote a raising the voice louder than a simple call. _Call_ is used on all ordinary occasions in order to draw a person to a spot, or for any other purpose, when one wishes to be heard; to _cry_ is to _call_ loudly on particular occasions: a _call_ draws attention; a _cry_ awakens alarm.  
To _cry_ is for general purposes of convenience, as the _cry_ of the hunter, or the _cries_ of persons to or among numbers; to _exclaim_ is an expression of some particular feeling.  
See also [alarm](entry://alarm); [name](entry://name)  
**CALL, INVITE, BID, SUMMON.** — _Call_, in its abstract and original sense, signifies simply to give an expression of the voice. _Bid_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _beodan_, to command. _Invite_ comes from Latin _invitus_, unwilling, the unwilling person being one who must be especially requested or _invited_ to do something. _Summon_ is derived from Latin _submoneo_, from _sub_ and _monere_, to warn, and signifies to give special notice.  
The idea of signifying one's wish to another to do anything is included in all these terms. In the act of _calling_, any sounds may be used; we may _call_ by simply raising the voice; _inviting_ may be a direct or indirect act; we may _invite_ by looks or signs as well as by words, by writing as well as by speaking.  
To _bid_ and _summon_ require the express use of words; the former is always directly addressed to the person, the latter may be conveyed by an indirect channel.  
As the action of _calling_ requires no articulate sounds, it may be properly applied to animals; as sheep _call_ their young.  
So likewise to inanimate objects when made to sound by way of signal or for the purpose of _calling._  
So likewise _invite_ may be said not only of unconscious, but spiritual agents.  
_Calling_ is the act of persons of all ranks, superiors, inferiors, or equals; it may therefore be either a command, a demand, or a simple request. Parents and children, masters and servants, _call_ to each other as the occasion requires.  
_Bidding_ is always the act of a superior by way of command or entreaty.  
_Inviting_ is an act of courtesy or kindness between equals.  
To _summon_ is an act of authority, as to _summon_ witnesses.  
When these words are employed in the sense of causing any one to come to a place, _call_ and _summon_ are most nearly allied, as are also _bid_ and _invite._ In this case to _call_ is an act of discretion on ordinary occasions, and performed in an ordinary manner; as to _call_ a meeting, to _call_ together, to _call_ home: to _summon_ is a formal act, and more or less imperative according to the occasion; as to _summon_ a jury.  
_Bidding_ and _inviting_, though acts of kindness, are distinguished as before according to the condition of the person; _bid_ is properly the act of a superior, and _invite_ of an equal, or one entitled to the courtesies of life.  
These terms may all be used in the figurative application with a similar distinction in sense. Things personified may be said to _call, summon, bid, invite._  
Things personified may also be said to be _called, invited, bidden_, or _summoned._

####calm 
**CALM, COMPOSED, COLLECTED.**  
_Calm_ (see [appease](entry://appease)). _Composed_, from the verb _compose_, marks the state of being _composed;_ and _collected_, from _collect_, the state of being _collected._  
These terms agree in expressing a state; but _calm_ respects the state of the feelings, _composed_ the state of the thoughts and feelings, and _collected_ the state of the thoughts more particularly. _Calmness_ is peculiarly requisite in seasons of distress, and amidst scenes of horror: _composure_, in moments of trial, disorder, and tumult: _collectedness_, in moments of danger. _Calmness_ is the companion of fortitude; no one whose spirits are easily disturbed can have strength to bear misfortune: _composure_ is an attendant upon clearness of understanding; no one can express himself with perspicuity whose thoughts are any way deranged: _collectedness_ is requisite for a determined promptitude of action; no one can be expected to act promptly who cannot think fixedly. It would argue a want of all feeling to be _calm_ on some occasions, when the best affections of our nature are put to a severe trial. _Composedness_ of mind associated with the detection of guilt evinces a hardened conscience and an insensibility to shame. _Collectedness_ of mind has contributed in no small degree to the preservation of some persons' lives in moments of the most imminent peril.

**CALM, PLACID, SERENE.** — _Calm_ (see above). _Placid_, in Latin _placidus_, from _placeo_, please, signifies the state of being pleased, or free from uneasiness. _Serene_ is derived from Latin _serenus_, bright, clear.  
_Calm_ and _serene_ are applied to the elements; _placid_ only to the mind. _Calmness_ respects only the state of the winds, _serenity_ that of the air and heavens; the weather is _calm_ when it is free from agitation: it is _serene_ when free from noise and vapor. _Calm_ respects the total absence of all perturbation; _placid_, the ease and contentment of the mind; _serene_, clearness and composure of the mind.  
As in the natural world a particular agitation of the wind is succeeded by a _calm_, so in the mind of man, when an unusual effervescence has been produced, it commonly subsides into a _calm; placidity_ and _serenity_ have more that is even and regular in them; they are positively what they are. _Calm_ is a temporary state of the feelings; _placid_ and _serene_ are habits of the mind. We speak of a _calm_ state, but a _placid_ and _serene_ temper. _Placidity_ is more of a natural gift; _serenity_ is acquired: people with not very ardent desires or warmth of feeling will evince _placidity;_ they are pleased with all that passes inwardly or outwardly: nothing contributes so much to _serenity_ of mind as a pervading sense of God's good providence, which checks all impatience, softens down every asperity of humor, and gives a steady current to the feelings.

####camouflage 
**CAMOUFLAGE, DISGUISE, MASK.**  
_Camouflage_ is a bit of trench slang which bids fair to become a naturalized English word. It is said to have been originally applied to the actor's make-up, and is derived through French _camoufler_, to disguise, from Latin _caput_, head, and Low Latin _muffulare_, to muffle. It referred to the covering of the head or disguising of the features in such a way as to escape recognition. It is now applied to the art of concealing or disguising guns, trenches, etc., in such a way that they appear to the enemy to be innocuous features of the natural scenery.  
In meaning _camouflage_ does not really differ from _disguise;_ in most instances _disguise_ may be substituted for it. But it is a much fresher and more picturesque term, and carries with it a definite suggestion of the romance and adventure of warfare. _Mask_ is a word which also has the fundamental meaning of _disguise_, and suggests an image similar to that originally implied by _camouflage._ But it has not the vividness and timeliness of the new word 

####can 
**CAN, MAY.**  
_Can_, in the Northern languages _können_, etc., is derived, most probably, from _kennen_, to know, from the natural intimacy which subsists between knowledge and power. _May_ is in German _mögen_, to desire or wish, its present meaning having developed from the connections between wishing and complying with a wish. _Can_ denotes possibility, _may_ liberty and probability: he who has sound limbs _can_ walk; but he _may_ not walk in places which are prohibited. 

####cancel 
See [abolish](entry://abolish); [blot](entry://blot)

####candid 
**CANDID, OPEN, SINCERE.**  
_Candid_, Latin _Candidus_, from _candere_, to shine, signifies to be pure as truth itself. _Open_, Anglo-Saxon _ofen_, is possibly allied to _up_, and may have signified the lifting up of the tent door. _Sincere_ comes from Latin _sincerus_, pure, unaffected.  
_Candor_ arises from a conscious purity of intentions; _openness_, from a warmth of feeling and love of communication; _sincerity_, from a love of truth.  
_Candor_ obliges us to acknowledge even that which may make against ourselves; it is disinterested: _openness_ impels us to utter whatever passes in the mind; it is unguarded: _sincerity_ prevents us from speaking what we do not think; it is positive. A _candid_ man will have no reserve when _openness_ is necessary; an _open_ man cannot maintain a reserve at any time; a _sincere_ man will maintain a reserve only as far as it is consistent with truth. _Candor_ wins much upon those who come in connection with it; it removes misunderstandings and obviates differences; the want of it occasions suspicion and discontent. _Openness_ gains as many enemies as friends; it requires to be well regulated not to be offensive; there is no mind so pure and disciplined that all the thoughts and feelings which it gives birth to may or ought to be made public. _Sincerity_ is an indispensable virtue; the want of it is always mischievous, frequently fatal.

####capacity 
**CAPACITY, CAPACIOUSNESS.**  
_Capacity_ (see [ability](entry://ability)) is the abstract of _capax_, receiving or apt to hold; it is therefore applied to the contents of hollow bodies. _Capaciousness_ (see [ample](entry://ample)) is the abstract of _capacious_, and is therefore applied to the plane surface comprehended within a given space. Hence we speak of the _capacity_ of a vessel, and the _capaciousness_ of a room.  
_Capacity_ is an indefinite term designating the property of being fit to hold or receive, as applied to bodies generally; but _capaciousness_ denotes a fulness of this property as belonging to a particular object in a great degree. Measuring the _capacity_ of vessels belongs to the science of mensuration: the _capaciousness_ of a room is to be observed by the eye. They are marked by the same distinction in their moral application: men are born with various _capacities;_ some are remarkable for the _capaciousness_ of their minds.

####captious 
**CAPTIOUS, CROSS, PEEVISH, PETULANT, FRETFUL.**  
_Captious_ is derived from Latin _captio_, a sophistical argument, from _capere_, to hold. _Cross_, after the noun _cross_, Latin _crux_, signifies a temper which is contrary to the wishes of others. _Peevish_ is a word of imitative origin; the leading idea seems to have been to make a whining cry. _Fret_, Anglo-Saxon _fretan_, from _fra_, from, and _etan_, eat, signifies to eat away, hence a wearing and gnawing grief or anger. _Petulant_, Latin _petulans_, comes from the root found in _petere_, to seek, to fly toward, and signified originally a dissatisfied temper, one which was continually seeking something not in its possession.  
All these terms indicate an unamiable working and expression of temper. _Captious_ marks a readiness to be offended or come _across_ the wishes of others; _peevish_ expresses a strong degree of _crossness; fretful_, a complaining impatience; _petulant_, a quick or sudden impatience. _Captiousness_ is the consequence of misplaced pride; _crossness_, of ill-humor; _peevishness_ and _fret-fulness_ of a painful irritability; _petulance_ is either the result of a naturally hasty temper or of a sudden irritability: adults are most prone to be _captious;_ they have frequently a self-importance which is in perpetual danger of being offended: an undisciplined temper, whether in young or old, will manifest itself on certain occasions by _cross_ looks and words toward those with whom they come in connection: spoiled children are most apt to be _peevish;_ they are seldom thwarted in any of their unreasonable desires without venting their ill-humor by an irritating and offending action: sickly children are mostly liable to _fretfulness_, their unpleasant feelings vent themselves in a mixture of crying, complaints, and _crossness:_ the young and ignorant are most apt to be _petulant_ when contradicted.

####capture 
**CAPTURE, SEIZURE, PRIZE.**  
_Capture_, Latin _captura_, from _captus_, participle of _capere_, to take, signifies either the act of taking or the thing taken, but mostly the former. _Seizure_, in French _saisir_, comes from Late Latin _sacire_, to put, to place. _Prize_, French _prise_, the thing taken, from Latin _prehendere_, to take, signifies only the thing taken.  
_Capture_ and _seizure_ differ in the _mode:_ a _capture_ is made by force of arms; a _seizure_ by direct and personal force. The _capture_ of a town or an island requires an army; the _seizure_ of property is effected by the exertions of an individual.  
A _seizure_ always requires some force, but a _capture_ may be effected without force on unresisting objects. Merchant vessels are _captured;_ contraband goods are _seized_, or there may be an unlawful _seizure_ of another's property.  
_Capture_ and _seizure_ relate to the act of taking as well as the thing taken: _prize_ relates only to the thing taken, and its value to the captor. There are many _captures_ made at sea which never become _prizes;_ the term _prize_ is therefore applied to whatever valuable comes into our possession by our own efforts.

####cardinal 
**CARDINAL, CHIEF, LEADING, MAIN.**  
_Cardinal_, in Latin _cardinalis_, from _cardo_, a hinge, French _cardinal_, principal. The implication of a hinge in the term is said to have been derived from a letter erroneously attributed to Pope Anacletus I., in the first century, in which the apostolic chair was declared "the hinge and head of all the Churches and, as a door is controlled by its hinge, so all Churches are governed by tins Holy Chair. "  
For the difference between _chief_ and _main_ see [chief](entry://chief). _Cardinal_ differs from these two words mainly in the image that it suggests. _Chief_ and _main_ indicate objects, people, or ideas that are prominent by reason of position or size; _cardinal_ indicates something that is important by reason of its relation to something else. 

####care 
**CARE, SOLICITUDE, ANXIETY.**  
_Care_, Anglo-Saxon _caru_, anxiety, is allied to Old Saxon _kara_, sorrow, Old High German _chara_, a lament. _Solicitude_, from the same root as _solicit_, meant originally the state of being aroused or stirred up. _Anxiety_, from Latin _angere_ (whence _anger_ is also derived), to suffocate or torment, signifies a state of mental discomfort caused by uncertainty.  
These terms express the application of the mind to any object. _Care_ is the most indefinite of the three; it may be accompanied with pain or not, according to the nature of the object or the intensity of the application: _solicitude_ and _anxiety_ are accompanied with a positive degree of pain, the latter still more than the former. When _care_ is employed in the discharge of any office, it may be without any feeling, but it is always accompanied with active exertions, as the _care_ which a subordinate takes of a child. _Solicitude_ and _anxiety_ He together in the mind, unaccompanied with any other action: _solicitude_ has desire, mixed with fear; _anxiety_ has distress for the present, mixed with fear for the future.  
_Care_ is inseparable from the business of life; there is nothing which is done but what requires _care_ for it to be well done: _solicitude_ and _anxiety_ are produced by the events and circumstances of life, with this difference, that, as_ solicitude_ has so much of desire in it, it is more under our control or may be more easily restrained than _anxiety_, which is forced upon us.  
_Care_ by its intensity and duration, and _anxiety_ by its violence, may produce injurious effects; as worn out with _care_, overwhelmed with _anxiety. Solicitude_ is awakened only by ordinary events, and never rises to excess: there may be a _solicitude_ to please, or a tender _solicitude_ for the health of a person.

**CARE, CONCERN, REGARD.** — _Care_ (see above). _Concern_ (see [affair](entry://affair)) and _regard_, from Latin _re_, back, and French _garder_, to look at (from an Old High German root signifying to watch, or guard, found in _wary, ward_, etc., meaning to look back upon or look at attentively), are nearly allied to each other in denoting the application of the mind to any object.  
_Care_, as in the former article, is either coupled with active exertions or is employed in the right doing of things; we take _care_ to do a thing, or we bestow _care_ upon a thing: _concern_ and _regard_ both he in the mind, but in the former case the feelings as well as the thoughts, and in the latter case the thoughts only, have a part. _Concern_ is particularly applied to that which awakens a painful interest in the mind, as to express or show a _concern_ for another's troubles or distress; _regard_ is applied to that which one values sufficiently to bestow one's thoughts upon.  
_Care_ and _concern_ are also used to denote the object of caring or concerning, but _regard_ is only employed for the action of regarding. The _care_ is that which requires _care_ to be bestowed upon it; _concern_ is that in which one is concerned, or has a share or interest.  
**CARE, CHARGE, MANAGEMENT.** — _Care_ (see above). _Charge_, in French _charge_, is derived from Late Latin _carricare_, to load a car, whence _cargo_ is also derived. It is figuratively employed in the sense of a burden. _Management_, in French _ménagement_, is ultimately derived from Latin _manus_, hand, and signifies the doing or directing of something with the hand. _Care_ will include both _charge_ and _management;_ but, in the strict sense, it comprehends personal labor: _charge_ involves responsibility: _management_ includes regulation and order. A gardener has the _care_ of a garden; a nurse has the _charge_ of children; a steward has the _management_ of a farm: we must always act in order to take _care;_ we must look in order to take _charge;_ we must always think in order to _manage. Care_ is employed generally in all matters, high and low, which require mental application or active exertion; _charge_, in matters of trust and confidence; _management_, in matters of business and experience: the servant has the _care_ of the cattle; an _instructor_ has the _charge_ of youth; a clerk has the _management_ of a business.  
**CAREFUL, CAUTIOUS, PROVIDENT.** — _Careful_, or full of care, that is, having _care_, is the general term. _Cautious_, that is, having _caution_, and _provident_, that is, literally foreseeing, are modes of the _careful._ To be _cautious_ is to be _careful_ in guarding against danger; to be _provident_ is to be _careful_ in preventing straits and difficulties. One is _careful_ either in doing or in omitting to do: one is _cautious in_ abstaining from doing, as to be _careful_ in writing, or in the disposition of things; to be _cautious_ not to offend, not to say anything.  
When the terms _careful_ and _cautious_ are applied to what is to be avoided, the former is used in ordinary cases, where the difficulty of avoiding the evil is not great; the latter on extraordinary occasions, where the danger of falling into the evil is great.  
The term _careful_ is applied for the most part to present matters, but _provident_ only to that which is future. One is _careful_ of his money or his books, but _provident_ toward a time of need.  
These words are all employed to denote a habit of the mind or a characteristic of the person with a similar distinction, except that _caution_, being properly a virtue of the occasion, becomes excessive if it be always employed whether it be necessary or not.

####caress 
**CARESS, FONDLE.**  
Both these terms mark a species of endearment. _Caress_, like _cherish_, and the French _chérir_ and _cher_, comes from the Latin _carus_, dear, signifying the expression of a tender sentiment. _Fondle_, from _fond_ (for derivation see under AFFECTION), is a frequentative verb, signifying to become _fond_ of, or express one's _fondness_ for.  
We _caress_ by words or actions; we _fondle_ by actions only: _caresses_ are not always unsuitable; but _fondling_, which is the extreme of _caressing_, is not less unfit for the one who receives than for the one who gives: animals _caress_ each other, as the natural mode of indicating their affection; _fondling_, which is the expression of perverted feeling, is peculiar to human beings, who alone abuse the faculties with which they are endowed. 

####cargo 
See [freight](entry://freight)

####caricature 
**CARICATURE, BURLESQUE, EXAGGERATION, PARODY.**  
_Caricature_, in Italian _caricatura_, a satirical picture, from _caricare_, to load, Low Latin _carrico_, load, from _carrus_, a cart, signifies, literally, a picture that is overloaded with exaggeration, and, specifically, a twisted or distorted resemblance to a person or object, a figure, drawing, or description of a person or thing in which defects or peculiarities are greatly exaggerated in order to make the subject appear ludicrous. _Burlesque is_ derived from Latin _burrœ_, trifles, Italian _burlesco_, ludicrous, and signifies a trifling or ludicrous representation. _Exaggeration_, from Latin _ex_, an intensive prefix, and _agger_, heap, means a heaping up, hence a heightening by over-statement, over-coloring, etc. _Parody, parodia_, from Greek _παρωδία (παρά_, besides, and _ώδή_, song, English _ode)_, signified a song sung in imitation of another. All of these terms signify a humorous imitation, but they differ somewhat in their usual applications. _Caricature_ generally refers to a humorous imitation of a person; _burlesque_ to the imitation of an action or an occasion; and _parody_ to the imitation of a literary production — of words either spoken or written. _Caricature_ and _burlesque_ are almost interchangeable, however. _Exaggeration_ is a more general word. It signifies a humorous imitation which depends for its effect upon the heightening of certain features. An _exaggeration_ may not be a _caricature_ or a _burlesque_, though _caricatures_ and _burlesques_ usually depend upon _exaggeration_ for the creation of the humorous effect. 

####carnage 
**CARNAGE, SLAUGHTER, MASSACRE, BUTCHERY.**  
_Carnage_, from the Latin _caro, carnis_, flesh, implies properly a collection of dead flesh; that is, the reducing to the state of dead flesh. _Slaughter_, from _slay_, is the act of taking away life. _Massacre_, in French _massacre_, comes from Old French _maçacre_, shambles, slaughterhouse, the origin of which is unknown. _Butchery_, Old French _bochier_, signified originally the killing of goats, from Old French _boc_, a goat, German _bock_, English _buck. Carnage_ respects the number of dead bodies made; it may be said either of men or animals, but more commonly of the former: _slaughter_ respects the act of taking away life, and the circumstances of the agent: _massacre_ and _butchery_ respect the circumstances of the objects who are the sufferers of the action; the last three are said of human beings only. _Carnage_ is the consequence of any impetuous attack from a powerful enemy; soldiers who get into a besieged town, or a wolf that breaks into a sheepfold, commonly make a dreadful _carnage: slaughter_ is the consequence of warfare; in battles the _slaughter_ will be very considerable where both parties defend themselves pertinaciously: a _massacre_ is the consequence of secret and personal resentment between bodies of people; it is always a stain upon the nation by whom it is practised, as it cannot be effected without a violent breach of confidence and a direct act of treachery; of this description was the _massacre_ of the Danes by the original Britons: _butchery_ is the general accompaniment of a _massacre;_ defenceless women and children are commonly _butchered_ by the savage furies who are most active in this work of blood.

####carriage 
**CARRIAGE, GAIT, WALK.**  
_Carriage_, from the verb to _carry_ (see [bear](entry://bear)), signifies the act of _carrying_ in general, but here that of _carryina_ the body.  
_Gait_, allied to _go_, signifies the manner of going. _Walk_ signifies the manner of _walking. Carriage_ is here the most general term; it respects the manner of _carrying_ the body, whether in a state of motion or rest: _gait_ is the mode of _carrying_ the limbs and body whenever we move: _walk_ is the manner of _carrying_ the body when we move forward to _walk._ A person's _carriage_ is somewhat natural to him; it is often an indication of character, but admits of great change by education; we may always distinguish a man as high or low, either in mind or station, by his _carriage; gait_ is artificial; we may contract a certain _gait_ by habit; the _gait_ is therefore often taken for a bad habit of going, as when a person has a limping _gait_ or an unsteady _gait: walk_ is less definite than either, as it is applicable to the ordinary movements of men; there is a good, a bad, or an indifferent _walk;_ but it is not a matter of indifference which of these kinds of _walk_ we have; it is the great art of the dancing-master to give a good _walk._

####case 
**CASE, CAUSE.**  
_Case_, in Latin _casus_, from _cadere_, to fall, happen, signifies the thing falling out. _Cause_, in French _cause_, comes from Latin _causa_, a cause.  
The _case is_ matter of fact; the _cause_ is matter of question: a _case_ involves circumstances and consequences; a _cause_ involves reasons and arguments: a _case_ is something to be learned; a _cause_ is something to be decided. A _case_ needs only to be stated; a _cause_ must be defended: a _cause_ may include _cases_, but not _vice versa:_ in all _causes_ that are to be tried there are many legal cases that must be cited: whoever is interested in the cause of humanity will not be heedless of those cases of distress which are perpetually presenting themselves.

####cast 
**CAST, THROW, HURL.**  
_Cast_ is a Scandinavian word signifying to throw. _Throw_, Anglo-Saxon _thrawan_, originally meant to twist. _Hurl is_ a Scandinavian word of imitative origin.  
These terms all express the idea of sending one object from another. To _cast_ is often a negative act, to _throw_ is always positive. We _cast_ off clothes by simply ceasing to wear them, but we _throw off_ clothes by removing them from the person with an actual effort. Hence the word _cast_ is most aptly applied when the manner of the action is left undefined, and the word _throw_ when it is intended to be expressly defined; as to _cast_ anchor, which may either be done by simply letting it down or by sending it forth from one with force: so to _cast_ seed into the ground may be simply to let it fall in, or to _cast_ anything into a box; but to _throw_ anything into the sea, or to _throw_ seed into the ground, implies a specific act done in a specific manner.  
For the same reason _casting_ is applied to what is done by a process of nature, as animals _cast_ their young, or _cast_ their coats, or to what is acted on by unconscious agents; as a ship or a person is _cast_ on a shore.  
_Throwing_ is not merely an act of direct purpose, but frequently of a violent or offensive purpose; as to _throw_ stones or dust at a person, to _throw_ down the gauntlet.  
So to _cast_ a glance may be simply to direct the eye to an object, but to _throw_ an angry look is the result of anger.  
The word _cast_, from the generality of its meaning, is properly employed in the higher style of writing, and in reference to higher subjects: when _throw_ is used in respect to any but familiar subjects, it is taken figuratively; as to _throw_ a veil over a matter, to _throw_ light upon a subject.  
When applied to similar objects, they preserve the same distinction; _throwing_ requires a greater effort or more violence than _casting_, as to _cast_ away prejudices, to throw off habits, etc.  
To _hurl_ is a violent species of _throwing_, employed only on extraordinary occasions. Sometimes it denotes the vehemence of the agent: but still oftener the magnitude of the object or the extremity of the occasion. The giants, who made war against heaven, are feigned to have been _hurled_ by the thunderbolts of Jupiter down to the earth.  
**CAST, TURN, DESCRIPTION.** — _Cast_, from the verb to _cast_ (see above), signifies that which is _cast_, and here, by an extension of the sense, the form in which it is _cast. Turn_, from the verb to _turn_, signifies also the act of _turning_ or the manner of being _turned. Description_ signifies the act of _describing_, or the thing which is to be _described._  
What is _cast_ is artificial; what _turns_ is natural: the former is the act of some foreign agent; the latter is the act of the subject itself: hence _cast_, as applicable to persons, respects that which they are made by circumstances; _turn_, that which they are by themselves: thus there are religious _castes_ in India, that is, men _cast_ in a certain form of religion; and men of a particular moral _cast_, that is, such as are _cast_ in a particular mould as respects their thinking and acting: so in like manner men of a particular _turn_, that is, as respects their inclinations and tastes.  
The _cast_ is that which marks a man to others; the _turn_ is that which may be known only to a man's self; the _description_ is that by which he is _described_ or made known to others.

####categorical 
**CATEGORICAL, UNQUALIFIED, POSITIVE.**  
_Categorical_ is derived from Greek _καταγορία_, an accusation, and is in logic an unconditional statement, one which does not depend upon a hypothesis or any modifying qualification. Hence the word has been extended to mean in general an _unqualified_ or _positive_ statement. These two adjectives, though synonymous here, have different original meanings. _Unqualified_ comes from Latin _qualis_, how much, and means not questioning or indicating how much — not modified in accordance with any possible standard of measurement. _Positive_, from _positus_, the past participle of _ponere_, means placed, ready to stand, unmovable. 

####caucus 
**CAUCUS, PRIVATE MEETING.**  
In this case _caucus_ represents a species of the _genus_ indicated in the words _private meeting. Caucus_ is a purely American term, possibly of American Indian origin, from the Algonkin _kaw-kaw-asu_, a counsellor. It has, strictly speaking, no real synonymes. The term applies chiefly to political gatherings, or private meetings of representatives of a party, faction, or interest, called to consider a situation and to plan a programme for action.  
A _caucus_ by different political parties is generally held prior to an election, at which candidates for office are selected and arrangements perfected for the ensuing campaign. Members of the Congress, of State legislatures, of municipal bodies, and even of smaller organizations, meet in _caucus_ prior to the opening sessions, or when deemed necessary, at any time during a session. Members who are entitled to attend a _caucus_ and, from dissatisfaction or other cause fail to do so, are said to _bolt the caucus_ — that is, they won't be bound to any action on which the _caucus_ has decided. 

####cause 
**CAUSE, REASON, MOTIVE.**  
_Cause_ is supposed to signify originally the same as case; it means, however, now, by distinction, the case or thing happening before another as its _cause. Reason_, in French _raison_, Latin _ratio_, from _ratus_, participle of _reor_, to think, signifies the thing thought, estimated, or valued in the mind. _Motive_, in French _motif_, from the Latin _motus_, participle of _movere_, to move, signifies the thing that brings into action.  
_Cause_ respects the order and connection of things; _reason_, the movements and operations of the mind; _motives_, the movements of the mind and body. _Cause_ is properly the generic term; _reason_ and _motive_ are specific: every _reason_ or _motive_ is a _cause_, but every _cause_ is not a _reason_ or _motive. Cause_ is said of all inanimate objects; _reason_ and _motive_, of rational agents: whatever happens in the world happens from some _cause_ mediate or immediate; the primary or first _cause_ of all is God: whatever opinions men hold, they ought to be able to assign a substantial _reason_ for them; and for whatever they do, they ought to have a sufficient _motive._  
As the _cause_ gives birth to the effect, so does the _reason_ give birth to the conclusion, and the _motive_ gives birth to the action. Between _cause_ and effect there is a necessary connection: whatever in the natural world is capable of giving birth to another thing is an adequate _cause;_ but in the moral world there is not a necessary connection between _reasons_ and their results, or _motives_ and their actions; the state of the agent's mind is not always such as to be acted upon according to the nature of things: every adequate _reason_ will not be followed by its natural conclusion, for every man will not believe who has _reasons_ to believe, nor yield to the _reasons_ that would lead to a right belief; and every _motive_ will not be accompanied with its corresponding action, for every man will not act who has a _motive_ for acting, nor act in the manner in which his _motives_ ought to dictate.  
**CAUSE, OCCASION, CREATE.** — To _cause_, from the substantive _cause_, naturally signifies to be the _cause_ of. _Occasion_, from the noun _occasion_, signifies to be the _occasion_ of. _Create_ is, in Latin, _creatus_, participle of _creare_, to make.  
What is _caused_ seems to follow naturally; what is _occasioned_ follows incidentally; or what _occasions_ may be incidental, but necessary: what is _created_ receives its existence arbitrarily. A wound _causes_ pain; accidents _occasion_ delay; busybodies _create_ mischief. The misfortunes of children _cause_ great affliction to their parents; business _occasions_ a person's late attendance at a place; disputes and misunderstandings _create_ animosity and ill-will. The _cause_ of a person's misfortune may often be traced to his own misconduct: the improper behavior of one person may _occasion_ another to ask for an explanation: jealousies are _created_ in the minds of relatives by an unnecessary reserve and distance. 

####caution 
See [admonish](entry://admonish); [caveat](entry://caveat)

####cautious 
**CAUTIOUS, WARY, CIRCUMSPECT.**  
For _cautious_ see **careful** under [care](entry://care). _Wary_, Anglo-Saxon _wœr_, is allied to _ward, guard_, etc., and to the Greek _όράω, I_ see. _Circumspect_, from _circumspicio_, look about, signifies literally looking on all sides. The idea of using great _care_ for the preventing of evil is common to these terms, but they vary in the degree and object of the care. _Cautious_ expresses less than _wary:_ we must be _cautious_ on all occasions where there is danger, but we must be _wary_ where there is great danger. A tradesman must be cautious in his dealings with all men, but he must be _wary_ when he has to deal with designing men.  
_Cautious_ and _wary_ are used in reference to practical matters, or the common matters of business, where the senses or bodily powers are more exercised than the mind: _circumspect_ is used in reference to matters of theory or contemplation, when the mind is principally employed. A traveler must be _cautious_ in passing along a road that is not familiar to him; he must be _wary_ in passing over slippery and dangerous places. A man must be _circumspect_ when he transacts business of particular importance and delicacy. Hence it is that _cautious_ and _wary_ may be said of the brute creation; _circumspect_ only of rational beings. 

####caveat 
**CAVEAT, CAUTION, WARNING.**  
_Caveat_, in Latin the same form, implying let him beware, from _cavere_, to beware, signifies, in law, a judicial warning or caution, an intimation to stay proceedings, an intimation or notice by a party interested in an approaching procedure to the proper officer, to prevent the latter from taking any action without an intimation or notice being given to the said party to enable him to appear and object. A _caveat_ is commonly filed with the proper officer against the probating of a will by an interested party to enable him to contest it or file objections against its probate. Until the _caveat_ is withdrawn by the person who filed it the probating process is halted.  
Hence _caveat_ represents a species of the genus indicated in _caution_ (from the same Latin verb, _caveo)_, and _warning_ (allied to _wary)._ Of these two words _warning_ is a stronger word than _caution._ We _caution_ others against something which may prove annoying or inconvenient; we _warn_ them against something really dangerous. 

####cavil

####cavity

####cease 
**CEASE, LEAVE OFF, DISCONTINUE.**  
_Cease_, in French _cesser_, Latin _cessare_, a frequentative of _cedere_, to yield, signifies to give up or put an end to. _Leave_, from Anglo-Saxon _leaf_, permission, is derived from the same root found in the adjective _lief_, dear or pleasing. _Discontinue_, with the privative _dis_, expresses the opposite of _continue._  
To _cease_ is neuter; to _leave off_ and _discontinue_ are active: we _cease_ from doing a thing; we _leave off_ or _discontinue_ a thing. _Cease_ is used either for particular actions or general habits: _leave off_ more usually and properly for particular actions; _discontinue_ for general habits. A restless, spoiled child never _ceases_ crying until it has obtained what it wants; it is a mark of impatience not to _cease_ lamenting when one is in pain. A laborer _leaves off_ his work at any given hour. A delicate person _discontinues_ his visits when they are found not to be agreeable. It should be our first endeavor to _cease_ to do evil. It is never good to _leave off_ working while there is anything to do and time to do it in. The _discontinuing_ a good practice without adequate grounds evinces great instability of character. 

####cede 
See **give up** under [give](entry://give)

####celebrate 
**CELEBRATE, COMMEMORATE.**  
_Celebrate_, in Latin _celebratus_, participle of _celebrare_, from _celeber_, populous, signifies to gather a big assembly for some festive purpose. _Commemorate_, in Latin _commemoratus_, participle of _commémore_, compounded of _com_ or _cum_ and _memoro_, to keep in mind, signifies to keep in the memory of a number.  
_Commemorate_ is a species of _celebrating;_ we always _commemorate_ when we _celebrate_, but not _vice versa._ Everything is _celebrated_ which is distinguished by any marks of attention, without regard to the time of the event, whether present or past; but nothing is _commemorated_ but what has been past. A marriage or a birthday is _celebrated;_ the anniversary of any national event is _commemorated. Celebrating_ is not limited to any species of events or circumstances; whatever interests any number of persons is _celebrated: commemorating_ is confined to whatever is thought of sufficient importance to be borne in mind, whether of a public or private nature. The election of a favorite member is _celebrated_ by those who have contributed to his success: a remarkable preservation, whether national or individual, sometimes demands some signal act of _commemoration. Celebrating_ is a festive as well as social act; it may be sometimes serious, but it is mostly mingled with more or less of gayety and mirth: _commemorating_ is a solemn act; it may be sometimes festive and social, but it is always mingled with what is serious, and may be altogether solitary; it is suited to the occasion, and calculated to revive in the mind suitable impressions of what is just. The birthday of our sovereign is always _celebrated_ by his people with such marks of honor and congratulation as are due from subjects to a prince: the providential escape of our nation from destruction by the Gunpowder Plot is annually _commemorated_ by a public act of devotion, as also by popular demonstrations of joy. The Jews _celebrate_ their feast of the Passover: as Christians, we _commemorate_ the sufferings and death of our Saviour by partaking of the Lord's Supper.

####celestial 
**CELESTIAL, HEAVENLY.**  
_Celestial_ and _heavenly_ derive their difference in signification from their different origin: they both literally imply belonging to heaven; but the former, from the Latin _cœlum_, signifies belonging to the _heaven_ of heathens; the latter, which has its origin among believers in the true God, has acquired a superior sense, in regard to _heaven_ as the habitation of the Almighty. This distinction is pretty faithfully observed in their application: _celestial_ is applied mostly in the natural sense of the _heavens; heavenly_ is employed more commonly in a spiritual sense. Hence we speak of the _celestial_ globe as distinguished from the terrestrial; of the _celestial_ bodies; of Olympus, as the _celestial_ abode of Jupiter; of the _celestial_ deities.  
But, on the other hand, of the _heavenly_ habitation, of _heavenly_ joys or bliss, of _heavenly_ spirits, and the like.

####censor 
**CENSOR, CRITIC, EXAMINER, INSPECTOR.**  
These terms all signify an official whose duty it is to see documents, publications, public performances, etc., and to pass judgment upon them. But _examiner_ and _inspector_ emphasize the act of seeing; _censor_ and _critic_ that of judging.  
_Examiner_ (for the derivation of _examine_ see [discuss](entry://discuss)) is a stronger word than _inspector. Examine_ means to _inspect_ with particular care, with the intention of passing a judgment. Similarly _critic_ is a milder and more general term than _censor_ (from Latin _censere_, to rate). To _censor_ is not merely to judge, but to abolish that which proves to be contrary to the _censor's_ judgment. These terms differ also in their applications. _Censor_ is applied particularly to the examining and judging of literary material — letters and cables in time of war, books, newspapers, etc. — and of artistic public productions. A rigorous _censorship_ of mail, etc., was maintained in all belligerent countries during the European war. The term _inspector_ is applied to various public officials whose duty it is to detect any violation of the laws — health-_inspectors_, milk-_inspectors_, customs-_inspectors_, etc. The terms _critic_ and _examiner_ are less frequently used to refer to public officials. 

####censure 
**CENSURE, ANIMADVERT, CRITICISE.**  
_Censure_ (see [accuse](entry://accuse)). _Animadvert_ and _criticise_ (see [animadversion](entry://animadversion)).  
To _censure_ expresses less than to _animadvert_ or _criticise;_ one may always _censure_ when one _animadverts_ or _criticises._ To _censure_ and _animadvert_ are both personal, the one direct, the other indirect; _criticism is_ directed to things, and not to persons only. _Censuring_ consists in finding some fault, real or supposed: it refers mostly to the conduct of individuals. _Animadvert_ consists in suggesting some error or impropriety; it refers mostly to matters of opinion and dispute; _criticism_ consists in minutely examining the intrinsic characteristics and appreciating the merits of each individually or the whole collectively; it refers to matters of science and learning. To _censure_ requires no more than simple assertion; its justice or propriety often rests on the authority of the individual: _animadversions_ require to be accompanied with reasons; those who _animadvert_ on the proceedings or opinions of others must state some grounds for their objections. _Criticism_ is altogether argumentative and illustrative; it takes nothing for granted, it analyzes and decomposes, it compares and combines. it asserts and supports the assertions. The office of the _censurer_ is the easiest and least honorable of the three; it may be assumed by ignorance and impertinence, it may be performed for the purpose of indulging an angry or imperious temper. The task of _animadverting_ is delicate; it may be resorted to for the indulgence of an overweening self-conceit. The office of a _critic_ is both arduous and honorable; it cannot be filled by any one incompetent for the charge without exposing his arrogance and folly to merited contempt.  
See also [blame](entry://blame); [lash](entry://lash)  
**CENSURE, CARP, CAVIL.** — _Censure_ (see above). _Carp_, a Scandinavian word, appears in Middle English with the meaning of to talk (in Icelandic it meant to boast). The present sinister sense is apparently due to a confusion with Latin _carpere_, to pluck. _Cavil_, in French _caviller_, Latin _caviller_, from _cavilla_, a taunt, and _cavus_, hollow, signifies to be unsound or unsubstantial in speech.  
To _censure_ respects positive errors; to _carp_ and _cavil_ have regard to what is trivial or imaginary: the former is employed for errors in persons; the latter for supposed defects in things. _Censures_ are frequently necessary from those who have the authority to use them; a good father will _censure_ his children when their conduct is _censurable. Carping_ and _cavilling_ are resorted _to_ only to indulge ill-nature or self-conceit: whoever owes another a grudge will be most disposed to _carp_ at all he does, in order to lessen him in the esteem of others: those who contend more for victory than truth will be apt to _cavil_ when they are at a loss for fair argument: party politicians _carp_ at the measures of administration; infidels _cavil_ at the evidences of Christianity, because they are determined to disbelieve.

####certain 
**CERTAIN, SURE, SECURE.**  
_Certain_, in French _certain_, Latin _certus_, comes from _cemere_, to discriminate. _Jure_ and _secure_ are variations of the same word, in French _sûr_, German _sicker_, Latin _securus;_ this is compounded of _se_ (sine), apart, and _cura_, care, signifying without care, requiring no care.  
_Certain_ and _sure_ have regard to a person's convictions; _secure_ to his interests or condition: one is _certain_ from actual knowledge or from a belief in others; one is _sure_ from a reliance upon others; one is _secure_ when free from danger. We can be _certain_ of nothing future but death; we may be _sure_ that God will fulfil His promises in His own way; we may be _secure_ against any loss or mischief if we use proper precautions.  
In respect to things the distinction is similar: facts, principles, and rules are _certain_ which are certainly known and admitted: rules, methods, guides, etc., are _sure_ which guard against error and may be depended upon; a place may be _secure_ which serves to _secure_ or preserve with certainty from mischief or danger.

####cessation 
**CESSATION, STOP, INTERMISSION.**  
_Cessation_, from the verb to _cease_, marks the condition of leaving off. _Stop_, from to _stop_, marks that of being _slopped_ or prevented from going on. _Rest_, from to _rest_, marks the state of being quiet; and _intermission_, from _intermit_, marks that of _ceasing_ occasionally.  
To _cease_ respects the course of things; whatever does not go on has _ceased;_ things _cease_ of themselves: _stop_ respects some external action or influence; nothing _stops_ but what is supposed to be _stopped_ or hindered by another: _rest_ is a species of _cessation_ that regards labor or exertion; whatever does not move or exert itself is at _rest: intermission_ is a species of _cessation_ only for a time or at certain intervals. That which _ceases_ or _stops_ is supposed to be at an end; _rest_ or _intermission_ supposes a renewal. A _cessation_ of hostilities is at all times desirable; to put a _stop_ to evil practices is sometimes the most difficult and dangerous of all undertakings: _rest_ after fatigue is indispensable, for labor without _intermission_ exhausts the frame. The rain _ceases_, a person or a ball _stops_ running, the laborer _rests_ from his toil, a fever is _intermittent._ There is nothing in the world which does not _cease_ to exist at one point or another: death _stops_ every one sooner or later in his career: whoever is vexed with the cares of getting riches will find no _rest_ for his mind or body; he will labor without _intermission_ oftentimes only to heap troubles on himself.

####chain 
**CHAIN, FETTER, BAND, SHACKLE.**  
_Chain_, in French _chaîne_, Latin _catena_, signifies that which takes or holds. _Fetter_, Anglo-Saxon _fetor_, meant a shackle for the _foot_, and is allied to the word _foot, feet. Band_, from _bind_, signifies that which _binds. Shackle_, Anglo-Saxon _sceacul_, bond, fetter, was originally a loose band which shook when the captive moved, _shackle_ being from the same root as _shake._  
All these terms designate the instrument by which animals or men are confined. _Chain_ is general and indefinite; all the rest are species of _chains:_ but there are many _chains_ which do not come under the other names; a _chain_ is indefinite as to its make; it is made generally of iron rings, but of different sizes and shapes: _fetters_ are larger; they consist of many stout _chains: bands_ are in general anything which confines the body or the limbs; they may be either _chains_ or even cords: _shackle_ is that species of _chain_ which goes on the legs to confine them; malefactors of the worst order have _fetters_ on different parts of their bodies, and _shackles_ on their legs.  
These terms may all be used figuratively. The substantive _chain_ is applied generally to whatever confines like a _chain_, and the verb to _chain_ signifies to confine as with a _chain:_ thus the mind is _chained_ to rules, according to the opinions of the freethinkers, when men adhere strictly to rule and order: the noun _fetter_ is seldom used except in the proper sense, but the verb to _fetter_ signifies to control or prevent the proper exercise of the mind, as to be _fettered_ by systems. _Band_, in the figurative sense, is applied, particularly in poetry, to everything which is supposed to serve the purpose of a _band;_ thus love is said to have its silken _bands. Shackle_, whether as a substantive or a verb, retains the idea of impeding the progress of a person, not in his body only, but also in his mind and in his moral conduct; thus a man who commences life with a borrowed capital is _shackled_ in his commercial concerns by the interest he has" to pay and the obligations he has to discharge.

####chance 
**CHANCE, FORTUNE, FATE.**  
_Chance_ (see [accident](entry://accident)) is here considered as the cause of what falls out. _Fortune_, in French _fortune_, Latin _fortuna_, comes from _fors_, chance, allied to _ferre_, to bear — fortune being that which is brought to one, borne in upon the sufferer. _Fate_, in Latin _fatum_, from _fatum_, participle of _fari_, to speak or decree, signifies that which is decreed, or the power of decreeing.  
These terms have served at all times as cloaks for human ignorance; and before mankind was favored by the light of Divine Revelation they had an imaginary importance which has now happily vanished. Believers in Divine Providence no longer conceive the events of the world as left to themselves, or as under the control of any unintelligent or unconscious agent, but ascribe the whole to an overruling mind, which, though invisible to the bodily eye, is clearly to be traced by the intellectual eye wherever we turn ourselves. In conformity, however, to the preconceived notions attached to these words, we now employ them in regard to the agency of secondary causes. But how far a Christian may use them, without disparagement to the majesty of the Divine Being, it is not so much my business to inquire as to define their ordinary acceptation. In this ordinary sense _chance_ is the generic, _fortune_ and _fate_ are specific terms: _chance_ applies to all things, personal or otherwise; _fortune_ and _fate_ are mostly said of that which is personal. _Chance_ neither forms, orders, nor designs; neither knowledge nor intention is attributed to it; its events are uncertain and variable: _fortune_ forms plans and designs, but without choice; we attribute to it an intention without discernment; it is said to be blind: _fate_ forms plans and chains of causes; intention, knowledge, and power are attributed to it; its views are fixed, its results decisive. A person goes as _chance_ directs him when he has no express object to determine his choice one way or other; his _fortune_ favors him if without any expectation he gets the thing he wishes; his _fate_ wills it if he reaches the desired point contrary to what he intended. Men's success in their undertakings depends oftener on _chance_ than on their ability; we are ever ready to ascribe to ourselves what we owe to our good _fortune;_ it is the _fate_ of some men to fail in everything they undertake. When speaking of trivial matters this language is unquestionably innocent, and any objection to its use must spring from an overscrupulous conscience. If I suffer my horse to direct me in the road I take to London, I may fairly attribute it to _chance_ if I take the right instead of the left; and if in consequence I meet with an agreeable companion by the way, I shall not hesitate to call it my good _fortune;_ and if, in spite of any previous intention to the contrary, I should be led to take the same road repeatedly, and as often meet with an agreeable companion, I shall immediately say that it is my _fate_ to meet with an agreeable companion whenever I go to London. See also [happen](entry://happen)  
**CHANCE, PROBABILITY.** — _Chance_ (see above). _Probability_, in French _probabilité_, Latin _probabilitas_, from _probabilis_ and _probare_, to prove, signifies the quality of being able to be proved or made good.  
These terms are both employed in forming an estimate of future events; but the _chance_ is either for or against, the _probability_ is always for a thing. _Chance_ is but a degree of _probability;_ there may in this latter case be a _chance_ where there is no _probability._ A _chance_ affords a possibility; many _chances_ are requisite to constitute a _probability._ What has been once may, under similar circumstances, be again; for that there is a _chance;_ what has fallen to one man may fall to another; so far he has a _chance_ in his favor; but in all the _chances_ of life there will be no _probability_ of success where a man does not unite industry with integrity. _Chance_ cannot be calculated upon; it is apt to produce disappointment; _probability_ justifies hope; it is sanctioned by experience.  
**CHANCE, HAZARD.** — _Chance_ (see above). _Hazard_ comes from Spanish _azar_, an unlucky throw at dice, possibly allied to Arabian _al zahr_, but the ultimate origin is doubtful.  
Both these terms are employed to mark the course of future events, which is not discernible by the human eye. With the Deity there is neither _chance_ nor _hazard;_ His plans are the result of omniscience: but the designs and actions of men are all dependent on _chance_ or _hazard. Chance_ may be favorable or unfavorable, more commonly the former: _hazard_ is always unfavorable; it is properly a species of _chance._ There is a _chance_ either of gaining or losing; there is a _hazard_ of losing. In most speculations the _chance_ of succeeding scarcely outweighs the _hazard_ of losing. 

####change 
**CHANGE, ALTER, VARY.**  
_Change_, in French _changer_, is probably derived from the Middle Latin _cambio, exchange_, signifying to take one thing for another. _Alter_, from the Latin _alter_, another, signifies to make a thing otherwise. _Vary_, in Latin _vario_, make various, from _varius_, doubtful.  
We _change_ a thing by putting another in its place; we _alter_ a thing by making it different from what it was before; we _vary_ it by _altering_ it in different manners and at different times. We _change_ our clothes whenever we put on others: the tailor _alters_ clothes which are found not to fit; and he _varies_ the fashion of making them whenever he makes new. A man _changes_ his habits, _alters_ his conduct, and _varies_ his manner of speaking and thinking, according to circumstances. A thing is _changed_ without _altering_ its kind; it is _altered_ without destroying its identity; and it is _varied_ without destroying the similarity. We _change_ our habitation, but it still remains a habitation; we _alter_ our house, but it still remains the same house; we _vary_ the manner of painting and decoration, but it may strongly resemble the manner in which it has been before executed.  
**CHANGE, EXCHANGE, BARTER, SUBSTITUTE.** — _Change_ (see preceding). _Exchange_ is compounded of _e_ or _ex_ and _changer_, signifying to _change_ in the place of another. _Barter_ is supposed to come from the French _barater_, to cheat or beguile, the ultimate origin of which is doubtful. _Substitute_, in French _substitut_, Latin _substitutus_, from _sub_, instead of, and _statuere_, to place, signifies to place one thing in the room of another.  
The idea of putting one person or thing in the place of another is common to all these terms, which varies in the manner and the object. _Change_ is the generic, the rest are specific terms: whatever is _exchanged, bartered_, or _substituted_ is changed, but not _vice versa._ To _change_ in respect to persons is to take one for another, without regard to whether they are alike or different, as a king _changes_ his ministers; to _exchange_ is to take one person in return for another who is in like condition, as prisoners are _exchanged_ in time of war.  
In respect to things, to _change_ is to take anything new or fresh, whether alike or different. Clothes may be _changed_, or books may be _changed_, or things may be _changed_ for others quite different; to _exchange_ is to take one thing for another, that is, either of the same kind or equivalent in value, as to _exchange_ one commodity for another, one house, or one piece of land, for another. To _change_ may often be the result of caprice, but to _exchange_ is always an act either of discretion or necessity.  
To _barter_ is a species of _exchanging_, namely, the giving of any commodity for others of the same or a different kind; it is confined properly to what passes by way of commerce, as, in dealing with savages, to _barter_ toys or knives for provisions.  
To _substitute_ is to put one person in the place of another for the purpose of doing any service or filling any office, as to _substitute_ one for another who has been drawn for the militia.  
In the moral application these terms bear the same analogy to each other, with this difference, that the word _barter_ is taken in a bad sense. A person _changes_ his opinions; but a proneness to such _changes_ evinces a want of firmness in the character. A good king at his death _exchanges_ a temporal for an eternal crown. The mercenary trader _barters_ his conscience for paltry pelf. Men of dogmatical tempers _substitute_ assertion for proof, and abuse for argument.  
**CHANGE, VARIATION, VICISSITUDE.** — _Change_ and _variation_ (see preceding). _Vicissitude_, in French _vicissitude_, Latin _vicissitude_, from _vicissim_, by turns, signifies changing alternately.  
_Change_ is, both to _vicissitude_ and _variation_, as the genus to the species. Every _variation_ or _vicissitude_ is a _change_, but every _change_ is not a _variation_ or _vicissitude. Change_ consists simply in ceasing to be the same: _variation_ consists in being different at different times; _vicissitude_, in being alternately or reciprocally different and the same. All created things are liable to _change;_ old things pass away, all things become new: the humors of men, like the elements, are exposed to perpetual _variations:_ human affairs, like the seasons, are subject to frequent _vicissitudes. Changes_ in societies or families are seldom attended with any good effect. _Variations_ in the state of the atmosphere are indicated by the barometer or thermometer. _Vicissitudes_ of a painful nature are less dangerous than those which elevate men to an unusual state of grandeur. By the former they are brought to a sense of themselves, by the latter they are carried beyond themselves.  
**CHANGEABLE, MUTABLE, VARIABLE, INCONSTANT, FICKLE, VERSATILE.** — _Changeable_, ready to change. _Mutable_, from the Latin _mutare_, to change, is the same as _changeable. Variable_ means liable to _vary. Inconstant_, compounded of the privative _in_ and _constant_, in Latin _constans_, from _con_ and _stare_, to stand together or remain the same, signifies not remaining the same for any long continuance. _Fickle_, Anglo-Saxon _ficol_, is allied to _fœcne_, deceitful, and _facen_, fraud. _Versatile_, in Latin _versatilis_, from _verto_, to turn, signifies easy to be turned.  
_Changeable_ is said of persons or things; _mutable_ is said of things only: human beings are _changeable_, human affairs are _mutable. Changeable_ respects the sentiments and opinions of the mind; _variable_, the state of the feelings; _inconstant_, the affections; _fickle_, the inclinations and attachments; _versatile_, the application of the talents. A _changeable_ person rejects what he has once embraced in order to take up something new; a _variable_ person likes and dislikes alternately the same thing; an _inconstant_ person likes nothing long; a _fickle_ person likes many things successively or at the same time; a _versatile_ person has a talent for whatever he likes. _Changeableness_ arises from a want of fixed principles; _variableness_, from a predominance of humor; _inconstancy_, from a selfish and unfeeling temper; _fickleness_, from a lightness of mind; _versatility_, from a flexibility of mind. Men are the most _changeable and inconstant;_ women are the most _variable_ and _fickle:_ the former offend from an indifference for objects in general or a diminished attachment for any object in particular; the latter from an excessive warmth of feeling that is easily biassed and ready to seize new objects. People who are _changeable_ in their views and plans are particularly unfit for the government of a state; those who are _variable_ in their humors are unsuitable as masters; people of an _inconstant_ character ought to be shunned as lovers; those of a _fickle_ disposition ought not to be chosen as friends.  
_Changeable, variable, inconstant_, and _fickle_, as applied to persons, are taken in the bad sense; but _versatility_ is a natural gift which may be employed advantageously.

####chaperon 
**CHAPERON, ATTENDANT, GUIDE.**  
Of these terms _attendant_ is the general word: _guide_ and _chaperon_ indicate particular kinds of attendants. For the meaning and derivation of _attendant_ see [accompany](entry://accompany). A _chaperon_, French _chaperon_, Italian _capperone_, the wearer of a hooded _cape_, signifies a woman who accompanies a young girl in public places to _guide_ her, and protect her from annoyance. The term _guide_ is applied to attendants whose function it is to point out the way to others — such as _mountain-guides, guides_ in large museums or public galleries, etc. 

####character 
**CHARACTER, LETTER.**  
_Character_ comes from the Greek _χάρακτήρ_, signifying an impression or mark, from _χάράσσειν_, to imprint or stamp. _Letter_ is derived from Latin _littera_, a letter.  
_Character_ is to _letter_ as the genus to the species: every _letter_ is a _character;_ but every _character_ is not a _letter. Character_ is any written or printed mark that serves to designate something; a _letter_ is a species of _character_ which is the constituent part of a word. Shorthand and hieroglyphics consist of _characters_, but not of _letters. Character_ is employed figuratively, but _letter_ is not. A grateful person has the favors which are conferred upon him written in indelible _characters_ upon his heart.  
_Character, Reputation_, — From the natural sense of a stamp or mark. _Character_ (see above) is figuratively employed for the moral mark which distinguishes one man from another. _Reputation_, from the French _réputer_, Latin _reputare_, to think, signifies what is thought of a person.  
_Character_ lies in the man; it is the mark of what he is; it shows itself on all occasions: _reputation_ depends upon others; it is what they think of him. A _character_ is given particularly: a _reputation_ is formed generally. Individuals give a _character_ of another from personal knowledge: public opinion constitutes the _reputation. Character_ has always some foundation; it is a positive description of something: _reputation_ has more of conjecture in it; its source is hearsay. It is possible for a man to have a fair _reputation_ who has not in reality a good _character_, although men of really good _character_ are not likely to have a bad _reputation._

####charm 
**CHARM, ENCHANT, FASCINATE, ENRAPTURE, CAPTIVATE.**  
_Charm_ (see **attraction** under [attract](entry://attract)). _Enchant_, French _enchanter, is_ derived from Latin _in_, in, and _can-tare_, to sing, whence _incantation is_ also derived. It signified to sing to another until the music entered _into_ the hearer, as it were, and had some magical or hypnotic effect upon his soul. _Fascinate_ is derived from Latin _fascinum_, a spell. _Enrapture_, compounded of _en_ and _rapture_, signifies to put into a _rapture;_ and _rapture_, from the Latin _rapio_, to seize or carry away, signifies the state of being carried away; whence to _enrapture_ signifies to put into that state. _Captivate_, in Latin _captivatus,_ participle of _captivo_, from _capere_, to take, signifies to take, as it were, prisoner.  
To _charm_ expresses a less powerful effect than to _enchant;_ a _charm_ is simply a magical verse used by magicians and sorcerers: _incantation_ or _enchantment_ is the use not only of verses, but of any mysterious ceremonies, to produce a given effect. To _charm_ and _enchant_ in this sense denotes an operation by means of words or motions; to _fascinate_ denotes an operation by means of the eyes or tongue: the two former are less powerful acts than the latter: the superstitious have always had recourse to _charms_ or _enchantments_, for the purpose of allaying the passions of love or hatred; the Greeks believed that the malignant influence passed by _fascination_ from the eyes or tongues of envious persons, which infected the ambient air, and through that medium penetrated and corrupted the bodies of animals and other things. _Charms_ and _enchantments_ are performed by persons; _fascinations_ are performed by animals: the former have always some supposed good in view; the latter have always a mischievous tendency: there are persons who pretend to _charm_ away the toothache, or other pains of the body: some serpents are said to have a _fascinating_ power in their eyes by which they can kill the animals on which they have fixed them.  
To _charm, enchant_, and _fascinate_ are taken in the improper sense to denote moral as well as natural operations; _enrapture_ and _captivate_ have a moral application only, in reference to those things which act more on the imagination or the moral feelings than on the senses. To _charm_ in this case is to act as a charm; to _enchant_, to act by enchantment; and to _fascinate_, to act by the power of fascination; all which, as in the former case, denote a secret or involuntary influence. To _enrapture_ and _captivate_, on the other hand, denote a direct but irresistible influence. To _charm, enchant_, and _enrapture_, when applied to the same objects, rise in their sense; to _enchant_ expresses a stronger effect than to _charm_, and to _enrapture_ than to _enchant._ Music ordinarily _charms_, delightful music _charms_ a delicate ear: the finest music only is calculated to _enrapture_, or the finest ears to be _enraptured._  
Beauty or fine scenery may in the same manner _charm, enchant_, or _enrapture_, according to the circumstances of the ease.  
To _fascinate_ and _captivate_ are, according to their original import, oftener used in a bad sense than a good one: we may sometimes speak indifferently of _fascinating_ manners or a _captivating_ address; but for the most part what _fascinates_ and _captivates_ acts on the passions to the injury of the understanding: a bad woman may have more power to _fascinate_ than a modest woman, and flowery language may _captivate_ when plain speech would not be heeded.

####chasten 
**CHASTEN, CHASTISE.**  
_Chasten, chastise_, both come through the French _châtier_, from the Latin _castigare_, to make pure.  
_Chasten_ has most regard to the end, _chastise_ to the means; the former is an act of the Deity, the latter a human action: God _chastens_ His faithful people, to cleanse them from their transgressions; parents _chastise_ their children, to prevent the repetition of faults: afflictions are the means which God adopts for _chastening_ those whom He wishes to make more obedient to his will; stripes are the means by which offenders are _chastised._

####chastity 
**CHASTITY, CONTINENCE.**  
_Chastity_, in French _chastité_, Latin _castitas_, comes from _castus_, pure, and the Hebrew _kedish_, sacred. _Continence_, in French _continence_, Latin _continentia_, from _continens_ and _contineo_, signifies the act of keeping one's self within bounds.  
These two terms are equally employed in relation to the pleasures of sense: both are virtues, but sufficiently distinct in their characteristics. _Chastity_ prescribes rules for the indulgence of these pleasures; _continence_ altogether interdicts their use. _Chastity_ extends its views to whatever may bear the smallest relation to the object which it proposes to regulate; it controls the thoughts, words, looks, attitudes, food, dress, company, and, in short, the whole mode of living: _continence_ simply confines itself to the privation of the pleasures themselves; it is possible, therefore, to be _chaste_ without being _continent_, and _continent_ without being _chaste. Chastity_ is suited to all times, ages, and conditions; _continence_ belongs only to a state of celibacy; the Christian religion enjoins _chastity_ as a positive duty on all its followers; the Romish religion enjoins _continence_ on its clerical members.

####cheat 
**CHEAT, DEFRAUD, TRICK.**  
_Cheat_ comes from _escheat_, Middle English _eschete_, Old French _eschete_, rent, that which falls to the landlord, from _ex_, out, and _cadere_, to fall. As Skeat says, the lords of the manor or the _escheaters_ "were often cheats in our sense, hence the verb. " _Defraud_, from _de_ and _fraud_, is either to practise fraud or get from a person by fraud. _Trick_, Norman French _trigue_, is probably influenced by Dutch _trik_, a pull, a stroke, a touch; the development of meaning is a little uncertain. These terms convey the idea of practising deception, but in different ways. One _cheats_ by direct and gross falsehood or artifice; one _defrauds_ by a settled plan or contrivance; one _tricks_ by a sudden invention. _Cheating_ and _tricking_ are resorted to in the common dealings of men; both may be equally low in their ends, but not equally base in their means. _Tricking_ requires ingenuity, which is not wanted in the practice of _cheating. Defrauding_ applies to the more serious concerns of life, and for the most part involves a breach of confidence, as to _defraud_ one's creditors.  
_Cheating_ has respect to the delusion practised on the person, and may therefore be applied to whatever produces the delusion. _Defrauding_ respects the thing wrongfully got, and may therefore be applied to persons, animals, or things which may suffer from fraud: as to _defraud_ the state, the revenue, or animals of their food. _Tricking_ properly passes only between men in their dealings with one another.

####check 
**CHECK, CURB, CONTROL.**  
All these terms express a species of restraining. _Check_ and _curb_ derive their meaning from natural objects. To _check_, in French _checé_ (from the Persian word for king found in _shah_, king), in reference to the movement in the game of chess by which the king is prevented moving, implies generally to impede the course. _Curb_, from Latin _curvare_, to bend, refers to the binding of the horse's neck by pulling on the bit. To _check_ is properly applied to bodies in motion, but _curb_ may be applied to those which are at rest or in motion: a horse with a tender mouth is easily _checked_ with a touch of the bridle; a young horse requires to be _curbed._  
To _check_ and to _curb_ have also a moral application; to _control_, contracted from _counter-roll_, or to keep one roll or account against another, has only a moral application. To _check_ is, as before, an act of much less restraint than to _curb._ Every feeling, however good, may sometimes require to be _checked;_ the passions, or will, require to be _curbed._  
To _check_ is applied to individual acts, frequently to the act or circumstance of the moment, as to _check_ the forwardness of youth; to _curb_ and _control_, to the general conduct; the former in respect to bodies of men as well as individuals; the latter in respect to individuals, as to _curb_ a people by laws, to _control_ youth until they are enabled to act for themselves.  
The act of _checking_ is applied to one's self; a person may _check_ himself when he is going to speak: to _curb_ and _control_ are properly applied to the acts of others.  
**CHECK, CHIDE, REPRIMAND, REPROVE, REBUKE.** — _Check_ (see above). _Chide_ is a word peculiar to English. It is not found in any other language. _Reprimand_ is derived from the gerundive of Latin _reprimere_, to repress, and so indicates something that ought to be repressed, hence the attempt to repress it by an expression of opinion. _Reprove_, in French _réprouver_, Latin _reprobo_, is compounded of the privative syllable _re_ and _probo_, signifying to find the contrary of good, that is, to find bad, to blame. _Rebuke_ is derived from Old French _busche_, a log, and meant originally to lop, to cut back.  
The idea of expressing one's disapprobation of a person's conduct is common to all these terms. A person is _checked_ that he may not continue to do what is offensive; he is _chidden_ for what he has done, that he may not repeat it: impertinent and forward people require to be _checked_, that they may not become intolerable; thoughtless people are _chidden_ when they give hurtful proofs of their carelessness. People are _checked_ by actions and looks as well as words; they are _chidden_ by words only: a timid person is easily _checked:_ the want even of due encouragement will serve to damp his resolution: the young are perpetually falling into irregularities which require to be _chidden._  
To _chide_ marks a stronger degree of displeasure than _reprimand_, and _reprimand_ than _reprove_ or _rebuke;_ a person may _chide_ or _reprimand_ in anger, he _reproves_ and _rebukes_ with coolness: great offences call forth _chidings;_ omissions or mistakes occasion or require a _reprimand:_ irregularities of conduct give rise to _reproof;_ and improprieties of behavior demand _rebuke. Chiding_ and _reprimanding_ are employed for offences against the individual, and in cases where the greatest disparity exists in the station of the parties; a child is _chidden_ by his parent; a servant is _reprimanded_ by his master. _Reproving_ and _rebuking_ have less to do with the relation or station of the parties than with the nature of the offence: wisdom, age, and experience, or a spiritual mission, give authority to _reprove_ or _rebuke_ those whose conduct has violated any law, human or divine: the prophet Nathan _reproved_ King David for his heinous offences against his Maker; our Saviour _rebuked_ Peter for his presumptuous mode of speech.

**CHECK, STOP.** — _Check_, as before, signifies to impede the course of a body in motion, that is, to cause it to move slowly; to _stop_ (see [cessation](entry://cessation)) is to cause it not to move at all: the growth of a plant is _checked_ when it does not grow so fast as usual; its growth is _stopped_ when it ceases altogether to grow: the water of a river is _stopped_ by a dam; the rapidity of its course is _checked_ by the intervention of rocks and sands.  
These words admit of a similar distinction when applied to the conduct or condition of men and things: if an evil be _checked_, it is diminished in extent; if it be _stopped_, it is altogether put an end to; so a person may be _checked_ in his career, or _stopped_ in his career, with the like distinction. 

####cheer 
**CHEER, ENCOURAGE, COMPORT.**  
_Cheer_ (see [animate](entry://animate)). _Encourage_, compounded of _en_ and _courage_, signifies to inspire with courage. _Comfort_ is compounded of _com_ or _cum_, and _fortis_, strong, signifying to invigorate or strengthen.  
To _cheer_ regards the spirits; to _encourage_, the resolution: the sad require to be _cheered;_ the timid to be _encouraged._ Mirthful company is suited to _cheer_ those who labor under any depression; the prospect of success _encourages_ those who have any object to obtain.  
To _cheer_ and _comfort_ have both regard to the spirits, but the latter differs in degree and manner: to _cheer_ expresses more than to _comfort_, the former signifying to produce a lively sentiment, the latter to lessen or remove a painful one: we are _cheered_ in the moments of despondency, whether from real or imaginary causes; we are _comforted_ in the hour of distress.  
_Cheering_ may be effected either by the direct effort of others or by anything passing outward or inward; a discourse or voice _cheers_, a prospect or a reflection _cheers: comforting_ is often properly effected by external objects, whether personal or otherwise. _Cheering_ is purely a mental operation, but _comforting_ may act on the body as well as on the mind.  
See also [animate](entry://animate); [hearten](entry://hearten)  
**CHEERFUL, MERRY, SPRIGHTLY, GAY.** — _Cheerful_ signifies full of _cheer_, or of that which _cheers. Merry_, Anglo-Saxon _myrge_, meant originally "lasting a short time, " fragile, evanescent; hence that which makes the time pass quickly. _Sprightly_ should be spelled _spritely_, from _sprite_, Old French _esprit_, a spirit (Latin _spiritus)_, or the _spirit._ It signifies full of life, animated. _Sprightly_ is contracted from _spiritedly. Gay_ is from Old High German _wahi_, fine, beautiful.  
_Cheerful_ marks an unruffled flow of spirits; with _mirth_ there is more of tumult and noise; with _sprightliness_ there is more buoyancy; _gayety_ comprehends _mirth_ and indulgence. A _cheerful_ person smiles; a _merry_ person laughs; a _sprightly_ person dances; a _gay_ person takes his pleasure. The _cheerful_ countenance is permanently so; it marks the contentment of the heart and its freedom from pain: the _merry_ face will often look sad; a trifle will turn _mirth_ into sorrow: the _sprightliness_ of youth is often succeeded by the listlessness of bodily infirmity or the gloom of despondency: _gayety_ is as transitory as the pleasures upon which it subsists; it is often followed by sullenness and discontent. _Cheerfulness_ is a habitual state of the mind; _mirth_ is an occasional elevation of the spirits; _sprightliness_ lies in the temperature and flow of the blood; _gayety_ depends altogether on external circumstances. Religion is the best promoter of _cheerfulness;_ it makes its possessor pleased with himself and all around him; company and wine are but too often the only promoters of _mirth;_ youth and health will naturally be attended with _sprightliness;_ a succession of pleasures, an exemption from care, and the banishment of thought will keep _gayety_ alive.  
_Sprightliness_ and _mirth_ are seldom employed but in the proper sense as respects persons; but _cheerful_ and _gay_ are extended to different objects which affect the senses or the mind: _cheerful_ objects are such as cheer the spirits; _gay_ objects please or delight the senses; as a _cheerful_ prospect, a _cheerful_ room, _gay_ attire, a _gay_ scene, _gay_ colors, etc.

####chicanery 
**CHICANERY, PETTIFOGGERY.**  
_Chicanery_ and _pettifoggery_ are both words of obscure origin meaning the abuse of legal forms — trickery, sophistry, and subterfuge in conducting a case. _Pettifoggery_ comes from _pettifogger_, a legal practitioner of inferior status who gets up or conducts petty cases. Apart from this suggestion of particular attorneys of rascally practices in the development of the word _pettifoggery_, instead of the general habit of quibbling and cavilling in law-courts suggested in _chicanery_, there is really no difference between the words, and they can be used interchangeably. _Chicane_ was applied long ago to the game of pall-mall, then to a dispute arising in that game, and latterly to sharp practice, especially in law-suits. 

####chide

####chief 
**CHIEF, PRINCIPAL, MAIN.**  
_Chief_, in French _chef_, from the Latin _caput_, the head, signifies belonging to the uppermost part. _Principal_, in French _principal_, Latin _principalis_, comes from _princeps_, a chief or prince, signifying belonging to a prince. _Main_, from the Scandinavian, Icelandic _megn_, strong, signifies to a great degree.  
_Chief_ respects order and rank; _principal_ has regard to importance and respectability; _main_, to degree or quantity. We speak of a _chief_ clerk; a commander in _chief;_ the _chief_ person in a city; but the _principal_ people in a city; the _principal_ circumstances in a narrative, and the _main_ object. The _chief_ cities, as mentioned by geographers, are those which are classed in the first rank; the _principal_ cities generally include those which are the most considerable for wealth and population; these, however, are not always technically comprehended under the name of _chief_ cities: the _main_ end of men's exertions is the acquirement of wealth.  
See also [cardinal](entry://cardinal)  
**CHIEF, LEADER, CHIEFTAIN, HEAD.** — _Chief_ and _chieftain_ signify him who is _chief. Leader_, from to _lead_, and _head_, from the _head_, sufficiently designate their own signification.  
_Chief_ respects precedency in civil matters; _leader_ regards the direction of enterprises: _chieftain_ is a species of _leader;_ and _head_ is the superior in general concerns. Among savages the _chief_ of every tribe is a despotic prince within his own district, acting or directing in particular cases. Factions and parties in a state, like savage tribes, must have their _leaders_, to whom they are blindly devoted and by whom they are instigated to every desperate proceeding. Robbers have their _chieftains_, who plan and direct everything, having an unlimited power over the band. The _heads_ of families were, in the primitive ages, the _chiefs_, who in conjunction regulated the affairs of state. _Chiefs_ have a permanent power, which may descend by inheritance, to branches of the same families: _leaders_ and _chieftains_ have a deputed power with which they are invested as the time and occasion require: _heads_ have a natural power springing out of the nature of their birth, rank, talents, and situation; it is not hereditary, but successive. _Chiefs_ ought to have superiority of birth combined with talents for ruling; _leaders_ and _chieftains_ require a bold and enterprising spirit; _heads_ should have talents for directing.

####childish 
**CHILDISH, INFANTINE.**  
_Childish_ is in the manner of an _infant._  
What _children_ do is frequently simple or foolish; what _infants_ do is commonly pretty and engaging; therefore _childish_ is taken in the bad, and _infantine_ in the good sense. _Childish_ manners are very offensive in those who have ceased, according to their years, to be children; the _infantine_ actions of some children evince a simplicity of character. 

####chill 
**CHILL, COLD.**  
_Chill_ and _cold_ are but variations of the same word, in German _halt_, etc.  
_Chill_ expresses less than _cold;_ that is to say, it expresses a degree of _cold._ The weather is often _chilly_ in summer, but it is _cold_ in winter. We speak of taking the _chill_ off water when the _cold_ is in part removed; and of a _chill_ running through the frame when the _cold_ begins to penetrate the frame that is in a state of warmth.

####choose 
**CHOOSE, PREFER.**  
_Choose_, Anglo-Saxon _ceosan_, is allied to Latin _gustare_, to taste, Greek _γεόομαι_, I taste. _Prefer_, in French _préférer_, Latin _prœfero_, compounded of _prœ_ and _ferre_, to take before, signifies to take one thing rather than another.  
To _choose_ is to _prefer_ as the genus to the species: we always _choose_ in _preferring_, but we do not always _prefer_ in _choosing._ To _choose_ is to take one thing from among others; to _prefer_ is to take one thing before or rather than another. We sometimes _choose_ from the bare necessity of _choosing;_ but we never _prefer_ without making a positive and voluntary _choice._  
When we _choose_ from a specific motive, the acts of _choosing_ and _preferring_ differ in the nature of the motive. The former is absolute, the latter relative. We _choose_ a thing for what it is, or what we esteem it to be of itself; we _prefer_ a thing for what it has, or what we suppose it has, superior to another. Utility or convenience are grounds for _choosing;_ comparative merit occasions the _preference:_ we _choose_ something that is good, and are contented with it until we see something better which we _prefer._ We calculate and pause in _choosing;_ we decide in _preferring;_ the judgment determines in making the _choice;_ the will or the affections determine in giving the _preference._ We _choose_ things from an estimate of their merits or their fitness for the purpose proposed; we _prefer_ them from their accordance with our tastes, habits, and pursuits. Books are _chosen_ by those who wish to read; romances and works of fiction are _preferred_ by general readers; learned works by the scholar. One who wants instruction _chooses_ a master, but he will mostly _prefer_ a teacher whom he knows to a perfect stranger. Our _choice_ is good or bad according to our knowledge; our _preference is_ just or unjust according as it is sanctioned by reason or otherwise. Our _choice_ may be directed by our own experience or that of others; our _preference_ must be guided by our own feelings. We make our _choice;_ we give our _preference:_ the first is the settled purpose of the mind, it fixes on the object; the latter is the inclining of the will, it yields to the object.  
_Choosing_ must be employed in all the important concerns of life; _preferring_ is admissible in subordinate matters only. There is but one thing that is right, and that ought to be _chosen_ when it is discovered: there are many indifferent things that may suit our tastes and inclinations; these we are at liberty to _prefer._ But to _prefer_ what we ought not to _choose_ is to make our reason bend to our will. The path of life should be _chosen;_ but the path to be taken in a walk may be _preferred._ It is advisable for a youth in the _choice_ of a profession to consult what he _prefers_, as he has the greatest chance of succeeding when he can combine his pleasure with his duty. A friend should be _chosen:_ a companion may be _preferred._ A wife should be _chosen;_ but unfortunately lovers are most apt to give a _preference_ in a matter where a good or bad _choice_ may determine one's happiness or misery for life. A wise prince is careful in the _choice_ of his ministers; but a weak prince has mostly favorites whom he _prefers._   
**CHOOSE, PICK, SELECT.** — To _choose_ is here, as in the foregoing article, a general and indefinite term, signifying to take one out of two or more. To _pick_ is allied to _peck._ In Middle English _pikken_, to pick, and _pekken_, to peck, are equivalent words. They are derived from _pic_, a sharp point, and signify to take anything up with a beak or a pointed thing; hence to take things one by one. _Select_, in Latin _selectus_, from _seligo_, or _se_, apart, and _lego_, to gather, signifies properly to set apart. We may _choose_ whatever comes in our way without regard to the number of the objects to be _chosen_ from, but we _pick_ or _select_ out of a number only; as to _pick_ or _select_ books from a library: we may _pick_ one or many out of a number, but we mostly _select_ a number. _Choosing_ is not always an act of particular design or discrimination; but to _pick_ and _select_ signify to _choose_ with care, the latter with still greater care than the former. What is _picked_ and _selected_ is always the best of its kind; but the former is commonly something of a physical nature, the latter of a moral or intellectual description. Soldiers are sometimes _picked_ to form a particular regiment; pieces are _selected_ in prose or verse for general purposes.  
**CHOOSE, ELECT.** — _Choose_ (see above). _Elect_, in Latin _electus_, participle of _eligo_, is compounded of _e_ and _lego_, signifying to gather or take out from.  
Both these terms are employed in regard to persons appointed to an office; the former in a general, the latter in a particular sense. _Choosing_ is the act either of one man or of many; _election_ is always that of a number; it is performed by the concurrence of many voices. A prince _chooses_ his ministers; the constituents _elect_ members of parliament. A person is _chosen_ to serve the office of sheriff; he is _elected_ by the corporation to be mayor. _Choosing_ is an act of authority; it binds the person _chosen: election_ is a voluntary act; the _elected_ has the power of refusal. People are obliged to serve in some offices when they are _chosen_, although they would gladly be exempt. The circumstances of being _elected_ is an honor after which they eagerly aspire, and for the attainment of which they risk their property and use the most strenuous exertions.  
To _elect_ may sometimes be extended in its application to persons or things for general purposes, which brings it nearer to the word _choose;_ but _election_ in this case signifies the _choosing_ one out of two or more specific objects; as where one has several friends and makes his _election_ of one to be his constant companion, or a person makes his _election_ where he has several alternatives set before him.

####circle 
**CIRCLE, SPHERE, ORB, GLOBE.**  
_Circle_ comes from Latin _circulus_, a diminutive of _circus_, a ring. _Sphere_ is derived from Latin _sphœra_, a transliteration of Greek _τθαίρα_, a ball. _Orb_ is derived from Latin _orbis_, a round disk or ring. _Globe_ comes from Latin _globus_, a ball.  
Rotundity of figure is the common idea expressed by these terms; but the _circle_ is that figure which is represented on a plane superficies; the others are figures represented by solids. We draw a _circle_ by means of compasses; the _sphere_ is a round body, conceived to be formed according to the rules of geometry by the circumvolution of a _circle_ round about its diameter; hence the whole frame of the world is denominated a _sphere._ An _orb_ is any body which describes a _circle;_ hence the heavenly bodies are termed _orbs:_ a _globe_ is any solid body the surface of which is in every part equidistant from the centre; of this description is the terrestrial _globe._  
A _circle_ may be applied in the improper sense to any round figure which is formed or supposed to be formed by circumscribing a space; simple rotundity constitutes a _circle:_ in this manner a _circle_ may be formed by real objects, as persons, or by moral objects, as pleasures. To the idea of _circle_ is annexed that of extent around, in the signification of a _sphere_, as a _sphere_ of activity, whether applied in the philosophical sense to natural bodies or in the moral sense to men. Hollowness, as well as rotundity, belongs to an _orb;_ hence we speak of the _orb_ of a wheel. Of a _globe_, solidity is the peculiar characteristic; hence any ball, like the ball of the earth, may be represented as a _globe._

####circuit 
**CIRCUIT, TOUR, ROUND.**  
_Circuit_, in French _circuit_, Latin _circuitus_, participle of _circumeo_, signifies either the act of going round or the extent gone. _Tour_ is derived from Latin _tornum_ (acc.), Greek _τόρνος_, a lathe. _Round_ comes from Latin _rotundus_, indicating the motion of a wheel, from _rota_, wheel.  
A _circuit_ is made for a specific end of a serious kind; a _tour_ is always made for pleasure; a _round_, like a _circuit_, is employed in matters of business, but of a more familiar and ordinary kind. A judge goes his _circuit_ at particular periods of time: gentlemen, in times of peace, consider it as an essential part of their education to make what is termed the grand _tour:_ tradesmen have certain _rounds_, which they take on certain days. We speak of making the _circuit_ of a place; of talcing a _tour_ in a given country; and going a particular _round._ A _circuit_ is wide or narrow; a _tour_ and a _round_ are great or little. A _circuit_ is prescribed as to extent; a _tour_ is optional; a _round_ is prescribed or otherwise.  
_Circuit_ is seldom used but in a specific sense; _tour_ is seldom employed but in regard to travelling; _round_ may be taken figuratively, as when we speak of going one's _round_ of pleasure. 

####circulate

####circumscribe 
**CIRCUMSCRIBE, INCLOSE.**  
_Circumscribe_, from the Latin _circum_, about, and _scribere_, to write, marks simply the surrounding with a line. _Inclose_, from the Latin _inclusus_, participle of _includo_, based on _in_ and _claudere_, to shut, marks a species of confinement.  
The extent of any place is drawn out to the eye by a _circumscription;_ its extent is limited to a given point by an _inclosure._ A garden is _circumscribed_ by any ditch, line, or posts that serve as its boundaries; it is _inclosed_ by wall or fence. An _inclosure_ may serve to _circumscribe;_ but that which _circumscribes_ is frequently imaginary, and will not serve to _inclose._ See also [bound](entry://bound)

####circumstance 
**CIRCUMSTANCE, SITUATION.**  
_Circumstance_, in Latin _circumstantia_, from _circum_ and _sto_, signifies what stands about a thing, or belongs to it as its accident. _Situation_, in French _situation_, comes from the Latin _situs_, a place.  
_Circumstance_ is to _situation_ as a part to a whole: many _circumstances_ constitute a _situation:_ a _situation_ is an aggregate of _circumstances._ A person is said to be in _circumstances_ of affluence who has an abundance of everything essential for his comfort; he is in an easy _situation_ when nothing exists to create uneasiness. _Circumstance_ respects that which externally affects us; _situation_ is employed both for the outward _circumstances_ and the inward feelings. The success of any undertaking depends greatly on the _circumstances_ under which it is begun; the particular _situation_ of a person's mind will give a cast to his words or actions. _Circumstances_ are critical, a _situation_ is dangerous.  
**CIRCUMSTANCE, INCIDENT, FACT.** — _Circumstance_ is, as before, a general term. _Incident_, in Latin _incidens_, participle of _incido_, or _in_ and _cadere_, to fall, signifying what falls upon or to another thing, and _fact_, in Latin _foetus_, participle of _facere_, to do, signifying the thing done, are species of _circumstances. Incident_ is what happens; _fact_ is what is done; _circumstance_ is not only what happens and is done, but whatever is or belongs to a thing. To everything are annexed _circumstances_, either of time, place, age, color, or other collateral appendages, which changes its nature. Everything that moves and operates is exposed to _incidents;_ effects are produced, results follow, and changes are brought about; these are _incidents:_ whatever moves and operates does, and what it produces is done or is the _fact:_ when the artificer performs any work of art, it depends not only on his skill, but on the excellence of his tools, the time he employs, the particular frame of his mind, the place where he works, with a variety of other _circumstances_, whether he will succeed in producing anything masterly. Newspapers abound with the various _incidents_ which occur in the animal or the vegetable world, some of which are surprising and singular; they likewise contain a number of _facts_ which serve to present a melancholy picture of human depravity.  
_Circumstance_ is as often employed with regard to the operations or properties of things, in which case it is most analogous to _incident_ and _fact;_ it may then be employed for the whole affair, or any part of it whatever that can be distinctly considered. _Incidents_ and _facts_ either are _circumstances_ or have _circumstances_ belonging to them. A remarkably abundant crop in any particular part of a field is for the agriculturist a singular _circumstance_ or _incident;_ this may be rendered more surprising if associated with unusual sterility in other parts of the same field. A robbery may either be a _fact_ or a _circumstance;_ its atrocity may be aggravated by the murder of the injured parties, the savageness of the perpetrators, and a variety of _circumstances. Circumstance_ comprehends in its signification whatever may be said or thought of anything; _incident_ carries with it the idea of whatever may befall or be said to befall anything; _fact_ includes in it nothing but what really is or is done. A narrative, therefore, may contain many _circumstances_ and _incidents_ without any _fact_, when what is related is either fictitious or not positively known to have happened: it is necessary for a novel or play to contain much _incident_, but not _facts_, in order to render it interesting; history should contain nothing but _facts_, as authenticity is its chief merit.  
**CIRCUMSTANTIAL, PARTICULAR, MINUTE.** — _Circumstantial_, from _circumstance_, signifies consisting of _circumstances. Particular_ comes from Latin _particula_, a double diminutive of _partem_ (acc.), part; hence a very little part. _Minute_, in French _minute_, Latin _minutus_, participle of _minuere_, to diminish, signifies diminished or reduced to a very small point.  
_Circumstantial_ expresses less than _particular_, and that less than _minute._ A _circumstantial_ account contains all leading events; a _particular_ account includes every event and movement, however trivial; a _minute_ account omits nothing as to person, time, place, figure, form, and every other trivial _circumstance_ connected with the events. A narrative may be _circumstantial, particular_, or _minute;_ an inquiry, investigation, or description may be _minute._ An event or occurrence may be _particular_, a circumstance or particular may be _minute._

####cite 
**CITE, QUOTE.**  
_Cite_ is derived from Latin _citare_, a frequentative of _ciere_, to arouse (compare _excite, incite_, etc.). As applied to persons it means to arouse, to summon; it was figuratively applied to things in a similar sense. To _cite_ a passage in a book or an instance in history meant to summon it to bear witness. _Quote_ is derived from Latin _guotare_, to mark off into chapters or verses for reference, from _quotus_, how much (compare _quota);_ from the significance to mark off it came to mean the repeating of the words marked off.  
To _cite_ is employed for persons or things; to _quote_ for things only: authors are _cited_, passages from their works are _quoted:_ we _cite_ only by authority; we _quote_ for general purposes of convenience. Historians ought to _cite_ their authority in order to strength en their evidence and inspire confidence; controversialists must _quote_ the objectionable passages in those works which they wish to confute: it is prudent to _cite_ no one whose authority is questionable; it is superfluous to _quote_ anything that can be easily perused in the original.  
**CITE, SUMMON.** — The idea of calling a person authoritatively to appear is common to these terms. _Cite_ is used in a general sense, _summon_ in a particular and technical sense: a person may be _cited_ to appear before his superior; he is _summoned_ to appear before a court: the station of the individual gives authority to the act of _citing;_ the law itself gives authority to that of _summoning._ When _cite_ is used in a legal sense, it is mostly employed for witnesses, and _summon_ for every occasion: a person is _cited_ to give evidence; he is _summoned_ to answer a charge. _Cite_ is seldomer used in the legal sense than in that of calling by name, in which general acceptation it is employed with regard to authors, as specified in the preceding article, and in some few other connections: the legal is the ordinary sense of _summon;_ it may, however, be extended in its application to a military _summons_ of a fortified town, or to any call for which there may be occasion; as when we speak of the _summons_ which is given to attend the death-bed of a friend; or, figuratively, death is said to _summon_ mortals from this world. 

####civil 
**CIVIL, POLITE.**  
_Civil_, in French _civil_, Latin _civilis_, from _civis_, a citizen, signifies belonging to or becoming a citizen. _Polite_, in French _poli_, Latin _politus_, participle of _polire_, to polish, signifies properly polished.  
These two epithets are employed to denote different modes of acting in social intercourse: _polite_ expresses more than _civil;_ it is possible to be _civil_ without being _polite: politeness_ supposes _civility_ and something in addition. _Civility_ is confined to no rank, age, condition, or country; all have an opportunity with equal propriety of being _civil_, but not so with _politeness;_ that requires a certain degree of equality, at least the equality of education; it would be contradictory for masters and servants, rich and poor, learned and unlearned, to be _polite_ to one another. _Civility_ is a Christian duty; there are times when every man ought to be _civil_ to his neighbor: _politeness_ is rather a voluntary devotion of ourselves to others: among the inferior orders _civility_ is indispensable; an _uncivil_ person in a subordinate station is an obnoxious member of society: among the higher orders _politeness_ is often a substitute; and, where the form and spirit are combined, it supersedes the necessity of _civility: politeness_ is the sweetener of human society; it gives a charm to everything that is said and done. _Civility_ is contented with pleasing when the occasion offers: _politeness_ seeks the opportunity to please; it prevents the necessity of asking by anticipating the wishes; it is full of delicate attentions, and is an active benevolence in the minor concerns of life. _Civil_ is therefore most properly applied to what passes from and to persons of inferior condition; as the peasantry are very _civil._  
Or it may be applied to the ordinary transactions of life without distinction of rank.  
_Polite_ is applied to those who are in a condition to have good-breeding.  
_Civility_ is rather a negative than a positive quality, implying the absence of rudeness. _Politeness_ requires positive and peculiar properties of the head and heart, natural and acquired. To be _civil_, therefore, is the least that any one can be to another if he do not wish to offend; but _politeness_, where it is real, is as strong an indication of kindness in the outward behavior as the occasion calls for.  
The term _civil_ may be applied figuratively, but _politeness_ is a characteristic of real persons only.

**CIVIL, OBLIGING, COMPLAISANT.** — _Civil_ is more general than _obliging_, which signifies ready to oblige. One is always _civil_ when one is _obliging_, but not always _obliging_ when one is _civil. Civil_ applies to words or manner as well as to the action; _obliging_, to the action only. As _civil_ is indefinite in its meaning, so it is indiscriminate in its application; _obliging_, on the other hand, is confined to what passes between particular persons or under particular circumstances. Strangers may be _civil_, and persons may frequently be _civil_ who from their situation may be expected to be otherwise; one friend is _obliging_ to another.  
_Civil_ and _obliging_ both imply a desire to do a kindness; but _compulsant_, which is a variation of _complacent_, from _complaceo_, to be highly pleased, signifies the desire of receiving pleasure, which is a refined mode of doing a kindness.  
_Civility_, lying very much in the manner, may be put on, and _complaisance_, implying a concern to please by being pleased, may be bad if it lead one to consult the humors of others to the sacrifice of duty or propriety.

####clandestine 
**CLANDESTINE, SECRET.**  
_Clandestine_, in Latin _clandestinus_, comes from _clam_, secretly. _Secret_, in French _secret_, Latin _secretus_, participle of _secernere_, to separate, signifies remote from observation.  
_Clandestine_ expresses more than _secret._ To do a thing _clandestinely_ is to elude observation; to do a thing _secretly_ is to do it without the knowledge of any one: what is _clandestine_ is unallowed, which is not necessarily the case with what is _secret._ With the _clandestine_ must be a mixture of art; with _secrecy_ caution and management are requisite: a _clandestine_ marriage is effected by a studied plan to escape notice; a _secret_ marriage is conducted by the forbearance of all communication; conspirators have many _clandestine_ proceedings and _secret_ meetings: an unfaithful servant _clandestinely_ conveys away his master's property from his premises; a thief _secretly_ takes a purse from the pocket of a bystander. 

####clasp 
**CLASP, HUG, EMBRACE.**  
_Clasp_ is a word confined to English. It first appears in the fourteenth century; it means to fasten by two interlocking parts. _Hug_ may be a Scandinavian word related to Icelandic _hugga_, to soothe; _hugna_, to please. _Embrace_, in French _embrasser_, is compounded of _en_ and _bras_, arm, Latin _brachia_, arms, signifying to take or lock in one's arms.  
All these terms are employed to express the act of inclosing another in one's arms: _clasp_ marks this action when it is performed with the warmth of true affection; _hug_ is a ludicrous sort of _clasping_, which is the consequence of ignorance or extravagant feeling; _embrace_ is simply a mode of ordinary salutation: a parent will _clasp_ his long-lost child in his arms on their re-meeting; a peasant in the excess of his raptures would throw his body, as well as his arms, over the object of his joy, and stifle with _hugging_ him whom he meant to _embrace;_ in the Continental parts of Europe _embracing_ between males, as well as females, is universal on meeting after a long absence, or on taking leave for a length of time; _embraces_ are sometimes given in England between near relatives, but in no other case.  
_Clasp_ and _embrace_ may be applied to other objects besides persons in the same sense. 

####class 
**CLASS, ORDER, RANK, DEGREE.**  
_Class_ is derived from Latin _classis_, a faction, a division, a fleet. _Order_, Latin _ordo_, is allied to Latin _ordiri_, to begin, from _oriri_, to rise. _Rank_, Old French _reng_, comes from Old High German _hrinc_, a ring of men. _Degree_, in French _degré_, comes from the Latin _gradus_, a stop.  
_Class_ is more general than _order; degree_ is more specific than _rank. Class_ and _order_ are said of the persons who are distinguished; _rank_ and _degree_ of the distinction itself: men belong to a certain _class_ or _order;_ they hold a certain _rank;_ they are of a certain _degree:_ among the Romans all the citizens were distinctly divided into _classes_ according to their property; but in the modern constitution of society _classes_ are distinguished from one another on general, moral, or civil grounds; there are reputable or disreputable _classes;_ the laboring _class_, the _class_ of merchants, mechanics, etc.; _order_ has a more particular signification; it is founded upon some positive civil privilege or distinction: the general _orders_ are divided into higher, lower, and middle, arising from the unequal distribution of wealth and power; the particular _orders_ are those of the nobility of the clergy, of freemasonry. and the like: _rank_ distinguishes one individual from another; it is peculiarly applied to the nobility and the gentry, although every man in the community holds a certain _rank_ in relation to those who are above or below him: _degree_, like _rank_, is applicable to the individual, but only in particular cases; literary and scientific _degrees_ are conferred upon superior merit in different departments of science; there are likewise _degrees_ in the same _rank_, whence we speak of men of high and low _degree._   
**CLASS, ARRANGE, RANGE.** — To _class_, from the noun class, signifies to put in a _class. Arrange_ and _range_ both come from the Old French _rangier_, from _reng_, Old High German _hrinc_, a ring, a row — _arrange_ being formed by the addition of Latin _ad_ (to) to the French verb.  
The general qualities and attributes of things are to be considered in _classing;_ their fitness to stand by each other must be considered in _arranging;_ their capacity for forming a line is the only thing to be attended to in _ranging. Classification_ serves the purposes either of public policy or science; _arranging_ is a matter of convenience to the individual himself; _ranging is_ a matter of convenience for others: men are _classed_ into different bodies according to some certain standard of property, power, education, occupation, etc.; furniture is _arranged_ in a room according as it answers in color, shade, convenience of situation, etc.; men are _ranged_ in order whenever they make a procession. All these words require more or less exercise of the intellectual faculty, but _classing_ is a more abstract and comprehensive act than either _arranging_ or _ranging._ All objects, external or internal, may admit of _classification_, according to their similitudes and differences; but _arranging_ and _ranging_ are particular acts employed in regard to familiar objects, and the order in which they ought to be placed. Ideas are _classed_ by the logician into simple and complex, abstract and concrete; an individual _arranges_ his own ideas in his mind: words are _classed_ by the grammarian into different parts of speech: words are _arranged_ by the writer in a sentence, so as to be suitable. To _arrange is_ a more complex proceeding than simply to _range;_ a merchant or tradesman _arranges_ his affairs when they are got into confusion, but a shopkeeper _ranges_ his goods in such manner as best to set them out to view.  
These words are applied figuratively in the same sense.

####clean 
**CLEAN, CLEANLY, PURE.**  
_Clean_ and _cleanly_ come from Anglo-Saxon _clœne_, pure, bright, which in German developed the special sense of little — German _klein. Pure_, in French _pur_, Latin _purus. Clean_ expresses a freedom from dirt or soil; _cleanly_ the disposition or habit of being _clean._ A person who keeps himself _clean_ is _cleanly;_ a _cleanly_ servant takes care to keep other things _clean. Clean_ is employed either in the proper or the figurative sense; _pure_, mostly in the moral sense: the hands should be _clean;_ the heart should be _pure;_ it is the first requisite of good writing that it should be _clean;_ it is of the first importance for the morals of youth to be kept _pure._

####clear 
**CLEAR, LUCID, BRIGHT, VIVID.**  
_Clear_, see [absolve](entry://absolve). _Lucid_, in Latin _lucidus_, from _lucere_, to shine, and _lux_, fight, signifies having light. _Bright_, see [brightness](entry://brightness). _Vivid_, Latin _vividus_, from _vivere_, to _live_, signifies being in a state of life.  
These epithets mark a gradation in their sense; the idea of light is common to them, but _clear_ expresses less than _lucid, lucid_ than _bright_, and _bright_ less than _vivid;_ a mere freedom from stain or dulness constitutes the _clearness;_ the return of light, and consequent removal of darkness, constitutes _lucidity; brightness_ supposes a certain strength of light; _vividness_ a freshness combined with the strength, and even a degree of brilliancy: a sky is _clear_ that is divested of clouds: the atmosphere is _lucid_ in the day, but not in the night; the sun shines _bright_ when it is unobstructed by anything in the atmosphere; lightning sometimes presents a _vivid_ redness, and sometimes a _vivid_ paleness: the light of the stars may be _clear_, and sometimes _bright_, but never _vivid;_ the light of the sun is rather _bright_ than _clear_ or _vivid;_ the light of the moon is either _clear, bright_, or _vivid._ These epithets may with equal propriety be applied to color as well as to light: a _clear_ color is unmixed with any other; a _bright_ color has something striking and strong in it; a _vivid_ color something lively and fresh in it.  
In their moral application they preserve a similar distinction: a conscience is said to be _clear_ when it is free from every stain or spot; a deranged understanding may have _lucid_ intervals; a _bright_ intellect throws light on everything around it; a _vivid_ imagination glows with every image that nature presents.

**CLEARLY, DISTINCTLY.** — That is seen _clearly_ of which one has a _clear_ view independent of anything else; that is seen _distinctly_ which is seen so as to distinguish it from other objects. We see the moon _clearly_ whenever it shines, but we cannot see the spots in the moon _distinctly_ without the help of glasses. What we see _distinctly_ must be seen _clearly_, but a thing may be seen _clearly_ without being seen _distinctly._ A want of light, or the intervention of other objects, prevents us from seeing _clearly;_ distance, or a defect in the sight, prevents us from seeing _distinctly._ Old men often see _clearly_, but not _distinctly;_ they perceive large or luminous objects at a distance, but they cannot distinguish such small objects as the characters of a book without the help of convex glasses; short-sighted persons, on the contrary, see near objects _distinctly_, but they have no _clear_ vision of distant ones, unless they are viewed through concave glasses.  
**CLEARNESS, PERSPICUITY.** — _Clearness_, from _clear_, is here used figuratively to mark the degree of light by which one sees things distinctly. _Perspicuity_, in French _perspicuitê_, Latin _perspicuitas_, from _perspicuus_ and _perspicere_, to look through, signifies the quality of being able to be seen through.  
These epithets denote qualities equally requisite to render a discourse intelligible, but each has its peculiar character. _Clearness_ respects our ideas and springs from the distinction of the things themselves that are discussed: _perspicuity_ respects the mode of expressing the ideas, and springs from the good qualities of style. It requires a _clear_ head to be able to see a subject in all its bearings and relations; to distinguish all the niceties and shades of difference between things that bear a strong resemblance, and to separate it from all irrelevant objects that intermingle themselves with it. But whatever may be our _clearness_ of conception, it is requisite, if we would communicate our conceptions to others, that we should observe a purity in our mode of diction, that we should be particular in the choice of our terms, careful in the disposition of them, and accurate in the construction of our sentences; that is _perspicuity_ which, as it is the first, so, according to Quintilian, it is the most important part of composition.  
_Clearness_ of intellect is a natural gift; _perspicuity_ is an acquired art: although intimately connected with each other, yet it is possible to have _clearness_ without _perspicuity_, and _perspicuity_ without _clearness._ People of quick capacities will have _clear_ ideas on the subjects that offer themselves to their notice, but for want of education they may often use improper or ambiguous phrases; or by errors of construction render their phraseology the reverse of _perspicuous:_ on the other hand, it is in the power of some to express themselves _perspicuously_ on subjects far above their comprehension, from a certain facility which they acquire of catching up suitable modes of expression. The study of the classics and mathematics is most fitted for the improvement of _clearness;_ the study of grammar, and the observance of good models, will serve most effectually for the acquirement of _perspicuity._

####clemency 
**CLEMENCY, LENITY, MERCY.**  
_Clemency_ is in Latin _clementia_, signifying mildness. _Lenity_ is in Latin _lenitas_, from _lenis_, soft. _Mercy_ is derived from Latin _merces_, pay, which has developed into words of curiously diverse meanings — _mercenary, merchant_, French _merci_, thanks, etc. In this connection it signifies that which brings a reward in heaven, and is influenced by the Latin _misericordia_, pitiful of heart.  
All these terms agree in denoting the disposition or act of forbearing to inflict pain by the exercise of power. _Clemency_ and _lenity_ are employed only toward offenders; _mercy_ toward all who are in trouble, whether from their own fault or any other cause. _Clemency_ lies in the disposition; _lenity_ and _mercy_, in the act; the former as respects superiors in general, the latter in regard to those who are invested with civil power: a monarch displays his _clemency_ by showing _mercy;_ a master shows _lenity_ by not inflicting punishment where it is deserved. _Clemency_ is arbitrary on the part of the dispenser, flowing from his will, independent of the object on whom it is bestowed: _lenity_ and _mercy_ are discretionary, they always have regard to the object and the nature of the offence or misfortunes; _lenity_, therefore, often serves the purposes of discipline, and _mercy_ those of justice, by forgiveness instead of punishment; but _clemency_ sometimes defeats its end by forbearing to punish where it is needful. A mild master, who shows _clemency_ to a faithless servant by not bringing him to justice, often throws a worthless wretch upon the public to commit more atrocious depredations. A well-timed _lenity_ sometimes recalls an offender to himself, and brings him back to good order. Upon this principle the English constitution has wisely left in the hands of the monarch the discretionary power of showing _mercy_ in all cases that do not demand the utmost rigor of the law. 

####clergyman 
**CLERGYMAN, PARSON, PRIEST, MINISTER.**  
_Clergyman_ is derived from Latin _clericus_, from Greek _κληρικός, κλήρος_, a lot; in Late Greek it signifies the consecrated members of a Christian society, whose lot or portion "is in the Lord. " _Parson_ is derived from Latin _persona_, a person of rank, and meant a person of rank in a Christian society. _Priest_ comes from the Greek _πρεσβύτερος_, signifying an elder who holds the sacerdotal office. _Minister_, in Latin _minister_, a servant, from _minor_, less or inferior, signifies literally one who performs a subordinate office.  
It acquired a special significance because of the Christian emphasis upon humility. The Pope called himself the "servant of the servants of Jesus Christ. "  
The word _clergyman_ applies to such as are regularly bred according to the forms of the national religion, and applies to none else. In this sense we speak of the English, the French, and Scotch _clergy_ without distinction. A _parson_ is a species of _clergyman_ who ranks the highest in the three orders of inferior _clergy_, that is, _parson_, vicar, and curate; the _parson_ being a technical term for the rector, or he who holds the living: in its technical sense it has now acquired a definite use, but in general conversation it is become almost a nickname. The word _clergyman_ is always substituted for _parson_ in polite society. When _priest_ respects the Christian religion it is a species of _clergyman_, that is, one who is ordained to officiate at the altar in distinction from the deacon, who is only an assistant to the _priest._ But the term _priest_ has likewise an extended meaning in reference to such as hold the sacerdotal character in any form of religion, as the _priests_ of the Jews, or those of the Greeks, Romans, Indians, and the like. A _minister_ is one who actually or habitually officiates. _Clergymen_ are therefore not always strictly _ministers_, nor are all _ministers clergymen._ If a _clergyman_ delegates his functions altogether he is not a _minister;_ nor is he who presides over a dissenting congregation a _clergyman._ In the former case, however, it would be invidious to deprive the _clergyman_ of the name of _minister_ of the Gospel, but in the latter case it is a misuse of the term _clergyman_ to apply it to any _minister_ who does not officiate according to the form of an established religion.

**CLEVER, SKILFUL, EXPERT, DEXTEROUS, ADROIT.**  
_Clever_, Middle English _cliver_, ready to seize, is allied to Middle English _cliver_, a claw. _Skilful_ comes from _skill_, a Scandinavian word which meant originally intelligent, discerning. _Expert_, in French _expert_, Latin _expertus_, participle of _experior_, to search or try, signifies searched and _tried. Dexterous_, in Latin _dexter_, signifies the quality of doing rightly, as with the right hand. _Adroit_ is derived from the French phrase _à droit_, from Latin _ad_ (to) and _directum_, right, justice, _ultimately_ from _regere_, to order or rule.  
_Cleverness_ is mental power employed in the ordinary concerns of life: a person is _clever_ in business. _Skill_ is both a mental and corporeal power, exerted in mechanical operations and practical sciences: a physician, a lawyer, or an artist is _skilful:_ one may have a _skill_ in divination, or a _skill_ in painting. _Expertness_ and _dexterity_ require more corporeal than mental power exerted in minor arts and amusements: one is _expert_ at throwing the quoit: _dexterous_ in the management of horses. _Adroitness_ is altogether a corporeal talent, employed only as occasion may require: one is _adroit_ at eluding the blows aimed by an adversary. _Cleverness_ is rather a natural gift; _skill_ is _cleverness_ improved by practice and extended knowledge; _expertness_ is the effect of long practice; _dexterity_ arises from habit combined with agility; _adroitness_ is a species of _dexterity_ arising from a natural agility. A person is _clever_ at drawing who shows a taste for it, and executes it well without much instruction: he is _skilful_ in drawing if he understands it both in theory and practice; he is _expert_ in the use of the bow if he can use it with expedition and effect; he is _dexterous_ at any game when he goes through the manoeuvres with celerity and an unerring hand; he is _adroit_ if, by a quick, sudden, and well-directed movement of his body, he effects the object he has in view.

####climacteric 
**CLIMACTERIC, CRITICAL, DANGEROUS.**  
These words all suggest a time of suspense, when some misfortune may be about to fall. Of the three words _climacteric_ is the most specific. _Climacteric_, from the Greek _κλϊμακτήρ_, a round or step of a ladder, pertains to one of the supposed critical and dangerous steps or periods in human life, in which some great change is by some believed to take place in the human constitution. The numbers 7 and 9 are thought by many to mark the years of age when such steps or periods are reached, and when dangerous attacks of sickness may be expected. The most critical period of all, according to belief, and known as the _grand climacteric_, is within the 63d year, that is 7x9, of a man's life, when his constitution is said to decline rapidly, involving him in critical illness till the year has passed and old age begins.  
_Critical_ (see [critical](entry://critical)) and _dangerous_ (see [danger](entry://danger)) are less limited in their application. _Dangerous_ is a stronger word than _critical. Critical_ suggests the possibility of misfortune; _dangerous_ the probability.

####cloak 
**CLOAK, MASK, BLIND, VEIL.**  
These are figurative terms, expressive of different modes of intentionally keeping something from the view of others. They are borrowed from those familiar objects which serve similar purposes in common life. _Cloak_ and _mask_ express figuratively and properly more than _blind_ or _veil._ The two former keep the whole object out of sight; the two latter only partially intercept the view. In this figurative sense they are all employed for a bad purpose. The _cloak_, the _mask_, and the _blind_ serve to deceive others; the _veil_ serves to deceive one's self. The whole or any part of a character may be. concealed by a _blind;_ a part, though not the whole, may be concealed by a _mask._ A _blind_ is not only employed to conceal the character, but the conduct or proceedings. We carry a _cloak_ and a _mask_ about with us; but a _blind_ is something external. The _cloak_, as the external garment, is the most convenient of all coverings for entirely keeping concealed what we do not wish to be seen; a good outward deportment serves as a _cloak_ to conceal a bad character. A _mask_ hides only the face; a _mask_, therefore, serves to conceal only as much as words and looks can effect. A _blind_ is intended to shut out the light and prevent observation; whatever, therefore, conceals the real truth, and prevents suspicion by a false exterior, is a _blind._ A _veil_ prevents a person from seeing as well as being seen; whatever, therefore, obscures the mental sight acts as a _veil_ to the mind's eye. Religion is unfortunately the object which may serve to _cloak_ the worst of purposes and the worst of characters: its importance in the eyes of all men makes it the most | effectual passport to their countenance and sanction; and its external observances render it the most convenient mode of presenting a false profession to the eyes of the world: those, therefore, who set an undue value on the ceremonial part of religion do but encourage thus most heinous of all sins, by suffering themselves to be imposed upon by a _cloak_ of religious hypocrisy. False friends always wear a _mask;_ they cover a malignant heart under the smiles and endearments of friendship. Illicit traders mostly make use of some _blind_ to facilitate the carrying on their nefarious practices. Among the various arts resorted to in the metropolis by the needy and profligate, none is so bad as that which is made to be a _blind_ for the practice of debauchery. Prejudice and passion are the ordinary _veils_ which obscure the judgment and prevent it from distinguishing the truth. 

####clog 
**CLOG, LOAD, ENCUMBER.**  
_Clog_ in Middle English means the wooden sole of a shoe; hence a hindrance. For the derivation of _load_ see [freight](entry://freight). _Encumber_ is from French _encombrer_, Latin _in_ and Late Latin _combrus_, an obstacle.  
_Clog_ is figuratively employed for whatever impedes the motion or action of a thing, drawn from the familiar object which is used to impede the motion of animals: _load_ is used for whatever occasions an excess of weight or materials. A wheel is _clogged_, or a machine is _clogged;_ a fire may be _loaded_ with coals, or a picture with coloring. The stomach and memory may be either _clogged_ or _loaded:_ in the former case by the introduction of improper food, and in the second case by the introduction of an improper quantity. A memory that is _clogged_ becomes confused, and confounds one thing with another; that which is _loaded_ loses the impression of one object by the introduction of another. _Clog_ and _encumber_ have the common signification of interrupting or troubling by means of something irrelevant. Whatever is _clogged_ has scarcely the liberty of moving at all; whatever is _encumbered_ moves and acts, but with difficulty. When the soots of plants are _clogged_ with mould, or any improper substance, their growth is almost stopped; weeds and noxious plants are _encumbrances_ in the ground where flowers should grow. 

####cloister 
**CLOISTER, CONVENT, MONASTERY.**  
_Cloister_, Latin _claustrum_, means literally an enclosure, and signifies a certain close place in a convent, or an enclosure of houses for canons, or, in general, a religious house. _Convent_, from the Latin _conventus_, a meeting, and _convenire_, to come together, signifies a religious assembly. _Monastery_, in French _monastère_, signifies a habitation for monks, from the Greek _μόνος_, alone.  
The proper idea of _cloister_ is that of seclusion; the proper idea of _convent is_ that of community; the proper idea of a _monastery_ is that of solitude. One is shut up in a _cloister_, put into a _convent_, and retires to a _monastery._ Whoever wishes to take an absolute leave of the world shuts himself up in a _cloister;_ whoever wishes to attach himself to a community that has renounced all commerce with the world goes into a _convent;_ whoever wishes to shun all human intercourse retires to a _monastery._ In the _cloister_ our liberty is sacrificed; in the _convent_ our worldly habits are renounced, and, those of a regular religious community being adopted, we submit to the yoke of established orders: in a _monastery_ we impose a sort of voluntary exile upon ourselves; we live with the view of living only to God. In the ancient and true _monasteries_ the members divided their time between contemplation and labor; but as population increased and towns multiplied _monasteries_ were, properly speaking, succeeded by _convents._ In ordinary discourse _cloister is_ employed in an absolute and indefinite manner: we speak of the _cloister_ to designate a _monastic_ state; as entering a _cloister;_ burying one's self in a _cloister;_ penances and mortifications are practised in a _cloister._ It is not the same thing when we speak of the _cloister_ of the Benedictines and of their _monastery;_ or the _cloister_ of the Capuchins and their _convent._

####close 
**CLOSE, COMPACT.**  
_Close_ is from the French _clos_, and Latin _clausus_, the participle of _claudere_, to shut. _Compact_ is derived from Latin _compacius, cum_, together, and _pangere_, to fasten, to fit, and signifies fitted, close, form.  
Proximity is expressed by both these terms; the former in a general and the latter in a restricted sense. Two bodies may be _close_ to each other, but a body is _compact_ with regard to itself. Contact is not essential to constitute _closeness;_ but a perfect adhesion of all the parts of a body is essential to produce _compactness._ Lines are _close_ to each other that are separated but by a small space; things are rolled together in a _compact_ form that are brought within the smallest possible space.  
**CLOSE, NEAR, NIGH.** — _Close_ (see above). _Near_ is the comparative of _nigh. Close_ is more definite than _near:_ houses stand _close_ to each other which are almost joined; men stand _close_ when they touch each other; objects are _near_ which are within sight; persons are _near_ each other when they can converse together. _Near_ and _nigh_, which are but variations of each other in etymology, admit of little or no difference in their use; the former, however, is the most general. People live _near_ each other who are in the same street; they live _close_ to each other when their houses are adjoining. _Close_ is annexed as an adjective; _near_ is employed only as an adverb or preposition. We speak of _close_ ranks or _close_ lines; but not _near_ ranks or _near_ lines.  
See also [end](entry://end); [sequel](entry://sequel)  
**CLOSE, SHUT.** — _Close_ (see above). _Shut_, Anglo-Saxon _scyttan_, meant originally to fasten a door with a bolt, and is allied to _shoot._ We still say "shoot the bolt" (Skeat).  
To _close_ signifies simply to put _close_ together; _shut_ to stop or prevent admittance; _closing_ is therefore a partial _shutting_, and _shutting_ a complete _closing;_ as to _close_ a door or window is to put it partially to, as distinguished from _shutting_ it, _i.e., shutting_ it _close._ The eyes are _shut_ by _closing_ the eye-lids, and the mouth is _shut_ by _closing_ the lips; and by the figure of metonymy to _close_ may therefore often be substituted for _shut:_ as to _close_ the eyes, to _close_ the mouth, particularly in poetry.  
There is, however, a further distinction between these two words: to _close_ properly denotes the bringing anything _close_, and may, therefore, be applied to any opening or cavity which may thus be filled up or covered over for a permanency; as to _close_ a wound, to _close_ the entrance to any place; but _shutting_ implies merely an occasional stoppage of an entrance by that which is movable: whatever is _shut_ may be opened in this sense; not only a door, a book, or a box may be _shut_, but also the ears may be _shut._ In familiar language it is usual to speak of _closing_ a scene, for putting an end to it; but in poetry the term _shut_ may without impropriety be used in the same sense.  
See also [blockade](entry://blockade)  
**CLOSE, CONCLUDE, FINISH.** — To _close_ is to bring toward an end; to _conclude_, from _con_ and _claudere_, to shut, _i.e._, to shut together, signifies to bring actually to an end; _finish_, in Latin _finio_ and _finis_, an end, signifies also literally to bring to an end. The idea of putting an end to a thing is common to these terms, but they differ in the circumstances of the action. To _close_ is the most indefinite of the three. We may _close_ at any point by simply ceasing to have any more to do with it; but we _conclude_ in a definite and positive manner. Want of time may compel us to _close_ a letter before we have said all we wish to say; a letter is commonly _concluded_ with expressions of kindness or courtesy. Whatever admits of being discontinued is properly said to be _closed;_ as to _close_ a procession, entertainment, and the like.  
Whatever is brought to the last or the desired point is properly said to be _concluded;_ as to _conclude_ a speech, a narrative, a business, and the like.  
To _conclude_ is to bring to an end by determination; to _finish_ is to bring to an end by completion: what is settled by arrangement and deliberation is properly _concluded;_ what is begun on a certain plan is said to be _finished._

####coadjutor 
**COADJUTOR, ASSISTANT.**  
_Coadjutor_, compounded of _von_ and _adjutor_, a helper, signifies a fellow-laborer. _Assistant_ signifies properly one that _assists_ or takes a part.  
A _coadjutor_ is more noble than an _assistant:_ the latter is mostly in a subordinate station, but the former is an equal; the latter performs menial offices in the minor concerns of life, and a subordinate part at all times; the former labors conjointly in some concern of common interest and great importance. An _assistant_ is engaged for a compensation; a _coadjutor_ is a voluntary fellow-laborer. In every public concern where the purposes of charity or religion are to be promoted _coadjutors_ often effect more than the original _promoters:_ in the medical and scholastic professions _assistants_ are indispensable to relieve the pressure of business. _Coadjutors_ ought to be zealous and unanimous; _assistants_ ought to be assiduous and faithful.

####coarse 
**COARSE, ROUGH, RUDE.**  
_Coarse_ was formerly _course_, and developed as an adjective from the phrase _in course_, to denote anything of ordinary character. _Rough_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _ruh_, rough, hairy. _Rude_ is derived from Latin _rudis_, raw, rough.  
These epithets are equally applied to what is not polished by art. In the proper sense _coarse_ refers to the composition and materials of bodies, as _coarse_ bread, _coarse_ meat, _coarse_ cloth; _rough_ respects the surface of bodies, as _rough_ wood and _rough_ skin; _rude_ respects the make or fashion of things, as a _rude_ bark, a _rude_ utensil. _Coarse_ is opposed to fine, _rough_ to smooth, _rude_ to polished.  
In the figurative application they are distinguished in a similar manner: _coarse_ language is used by persons of naturally _coarse_ feeling; _rough_ language, by those whose tempers are either naturally or occasionally _rough; rude_ language, by those who are ignorant of any better.

####coax 
**COAX, WHEEDLE, CAJOLE, FAWN.**  
_Coax_ is a comparatively recent word of uncertain origin. Dr. Johnson, 1755-73, describes it as "a low word. " The original meaning seems to have been to make a _cokes_ of, from _cokes_, a simpleton, a dupe. _Wheedle_ may be derived from Anglo-Saxon _wœdlian_, to beg, originally to be poor, from _wœdl_, poverty. _Cajole_ meant formerly to chatter like a jay. It may be of imitative origin. _Fawn_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _fahnian_, to rejoice, from _fœgen_, fain, glad, and means to rejoice servilely, hence to cringe.  
The idea of using mean arts to turn people to one's selfish purposes is common to all these terms: _coax_ has something childish in it; _wheedle_ and _cajole_ that which is knavish; _fawn_ that which is servile. The act of _coaxing_ consists of urgent entreaty and whining supplication; the act of _wheedling_ consists of smooth and winning entreaty; _cajoling_ consists mostly of trickery and stratagem, disguised under a soft address and insinuating manners; the act of _fawning_ consists of supplicant grimace and antics, such as characterize the little animal from which it derives its name: children _coax_ their parents in order to obtain their wishes; the greedy and covetous _wheedle_ those of any easy temper; knaves _cajole_ the simple and unsuspecting; parasites _fawn_ upon those who have the power to contribute to their gratifications: _coaxing_ is mostly resorted to by inferiors toward those on whom they are dependent; _wheedling_ and _cajoling_ are low practices confined to the baser sort of men with one another; _fawning_, though not less mean and disgraceful than the above-mentioned vices, is commonly practised only in the higher walks, where men of base character, though not mean education, come in connection with the great. 

####coerce 
**COERCE, RESTRAIN.**  
_Coerce_, in Latin _coerceo_, that is, _con_ and _arceo_, from _arca_, a chest, signifies to drive into _conformity_, with the under meaning of enclosing. _Restrain_ is a variation of _restrict_ (see [bind](entry://bind)).  
_Coercion_ is a species of _restraint:_ we always _restrain_ or intend to _restrain_ when we _coerce;_ but we do not always _coerce_ when we _restrain; coercion_ always comprehends the idea of force; _restraint_, that of simply keeping under or back: _coercion_ is always an external application; _restraint_ either external, or internal: a person is _coerced_ by others only; he may be _restrained_ by himself as well as others. _Coercion_ acts by a direct application: it opposes force to resistance: _restraint_ acts indirectly to the prevention of an act: the law _restrains_ all men in their actions more or less; it _coerces_ those who attempt to violate it; the unruly will is _coerced;_ the improper will is _restrained. Coercion_ is exercised; _restraint_ is imposed: punishment, threats, or any actual exercise of authority, _coerces;_ fear, shame, or a remonstrance from others, _restrains._

####coeval 
**COEVAL, CONTEMPORARY.**  
_Coeval_, from the Latin _œvum_, an age, signifies of the same age. _Contemporary_, from _tempus_, signifies of the same time.  
An age is a specifically long space of time; a time is indefinite; hence the application of the terms to things in the first case and to persons in the second: the dispersion of mankind and the confusion of languages were _coeval_ with the building of the tower of Babel; Addison was _contemporary_ with Swift and Pope. 

####cogent 
**COGENT, FORCIBLE, STRONG.**  
_Cogent_, from the Latin _cogere_, to compel; and _forcible_, from the verb to _force_ (see [compel](entry://compel)), have equally the sense of acting by _force. Strong_ is here figuratively employed for that species of strength which is connected with the mind (for derivation see [strong](entry://strong)).  
_Cogency_ applies to reasons individually considered; _force_ and _strength_, to modes of reasoning or expression: _cogent_ reasons impel to decisive conduct; _strong_ conviction is produced by _forcible_ reasoning conveyed in _strong_ language: changes of any kind are so seldom attended with benefit to society that a legislator will be cautious not to adopt them without the most _cogent_ reasons; the important truths of Christianity cannot be presented from the pulpit too _forcibly_ to the minds of men. Accuracy and _strength_ are seldom associated in the same mind; those who accustom themselves to _strong_ language are not very scrupulous about the correctness of their assertions.

####colleague 
**COLLEAGUE, PARTNER.**  
_Colleague_, in French _collègue_, Latin _collega_, compounded of _ligare_, to bind, signifies united in the same work. _Partner_, from Latin _partem_ (acc.), part, whence our word _part_ is derived, signifies one having a _part_ or share.  
_Colleague_ is more noble than _partner:_ men in the highest offices are _colleagues;_ tradesmen, mechanics, and subordinate persons are _partners:_ every Roman consul had a _colleague;_ every workman had commonly a _partner. Colleague_ is used only with regard to community of office; _partner_ is most generally used with regard to community of interest: whenever two persons are employed to act together on the same business they stand in the relation of _colleagues_ to each other; whenever two persons unite their endeavors either in trade or in games, or the business of life, they are denominated _partners:_ ministers, judges, commissioners, and plenipotentiaries are _colleagues;_ bankers, chess-players, card-players, and the like, have _partners._

####color 
**COLOR, DYE, TINGE, STAIN.**  
To _color_, in Latin _color_, signifies to put _color_ on or give _color_ to a thing. To _dye_, in Anglo-Saxon _deagian_, signifies to imbue with a _color._ To _tinge_, in Latin _tingo_, and Greek _τέγγειν_, to sprinkle, signifies to touch lightly with a _color. Stain_, in French _déteindre_, comes from Latin _dis_, apart, and _tingere_, color, signifies to put a _color_ on in a bad manner, or give a bad _color._  
To _color_, which is the most indefinite of these terms, is employed technically for putting a _color_ on a thing; as to _color_ a drawing.  
But to _color_, in the general sense of giving _color_, may be applied to physical objects; as to _color_ the cheeks. More commonly, however, to moral objects, as to _color_ a description with the introduction of strong figures, strong facts, or strong descriptions, etc.  
To _dye_ is a process of art, as in the _dyeing_ of cloth, but the term is applied to objects generally in the sense of imbuing with any substance so as to change the _color._ To _tinge_ may be applied to ordinary objects; as to _tinge_ a painting with blue by way of intermixing _colors;_ but it is most appropriately used in poetry.  
To _stain_ is used in its proper sense when applied to common objects; as to _stain_ a painting by putting blue instead of red, or to _stain_ anything by giving it an unnatural _color._  
Whence it has also a moral application in the sense of taking away the purity from a thing; as to _stain_ the reputation or character.  
**COLOR, HUE, TINT.** — _Hue_ and _tint_, from _tinge_, are but modes of _color;_ the former of which expresses a faint or blended _color;_ the latter a shade of _color._ Between the _colors_ of black and brown, as of ail other leading _colors_, there are various _hues_ and _tints_, by the due intermixture of which natural objects are rendered beautiful.  
**COLORABLE, SPECIOUS, OSTENSIBLE, PLAUSIBLE, FEASIBLE.** — _Colorable_, from to _color_ or _tinge_, expresses the quality of being able to give a fair appearance. _Specious_, from the Latin _species_, appearance, from the root _spec_, to see, signifies the quality of looking as it ought. _Ostensible_, from the Latin _ostendere_, to stretch before the eyes, signifies the quality of being able or fit to be shown or seen. _Plausible_, from _plaudo_, to clap or make a noise, signifies something deserving of applause or approval. _Feasible_, from the French _faire_, and Latin _facere_, to do, signifies literally _doable_, and denotes seemingly practicable.  
The first three of these words are figures of speech drawn from what naturally pleases the eye; _plausible_ is drawn from what pleases the ear: _feasible_ takes its signification from what meets the judgment or conviction. What is _colorable_ has an aspect or face upon it that lulls suspicion and affords satisfaction; what is _specious_ has a fair outside when contrasted with that which it may possibly conceal; what is _ostensible_ is that which presents such an appearance as may serve for an indication of something real: what is _plausible_ is that which meets the understanding merely through the ear; that which _is feasible_ recommends itself from its intrinsic value rather than from any representation given of it. A pretence is _colorable_ when it has the _color_ of truth impressed upon it; it is _specious_ when its fallacy is easily discernible through the thin guise it wears; a motive is _ostensible_ which is the one soonest to be discovered; an excuse is _plausible_ when the well-connected narrative of the maker impresses a belief of its justice: a plan is _feasible_ which recommends itself as fit to be put in execution. 

####combat 
**COMBAT, OPPOSE.**  
_Combat_, from the French _combattre_, from Latin _con_, together, and _batuere_, to beat, to fight together, is used figuratively in the same sense with regard to matters of opinion. _Oppose_, through French _opposer_, from Latin _ob_ and Late Latin _pansare_, for _pono_ to place one's self in the way, signifies to set one's self against another.  
_Combat_ is properly a species of _opposing;_ one always _opposes_ in _combating_, though not _vice versa._ To _combat_ is used in regard to speculative matters; _oppose_ in regard to private and personal concerns. A person's positions are _combated_, his interests or his measures are _opposed._ The Christian _combats_ the erroneous doctrines of the infidel with no other weapon than that of argument: the sophist _opposes_ Christianity with ridicule and misrepresentation. The most laudable use to which knowledge can be converted is to _combat_ error wherever it presents itself; but there are too many, particularly in the present day, who employ the little pittance of knowledge which they have collected to no better purpose than to _oppose_ everything that is good, and excite the same spirit of _opposition_ in others.  
See also [battle](entry://battle); [conflict](entry://conflict)

####combatant 
**COMBATANT, CHAMPION.**  
_Combatant_, from to _combat_, marks any one that engages in a _combat. Champion_, French _champion_, signifies originally a soldier or fighter, from the Latin _campus_, a field, especially a field of battle.  
A _combatant_ fights for himself and for victory; a _champion_ fights either for another or in another's cause. The word _combatant_ has always relation to some actual engagement; _champion_ may be employed for one ready to be engaged or in the habit of being engaged. The _combatants_ in the Olympic games used to contend for a prize; the Roman gladiators were _combatants_ who fought for their lives: when knight-errantry was in fashion there were _champions_ of all descriptions, _champions_ in behalf of distressed females, _champions_ in behalf of the injured and oppressed, or _champions_ in behalf of aggrieved princes. The mere act of fighting constitutes a _combatant;_ the act of standing up in another's defence at a personal risk constitutes the _champion._ Animals have their _combats_, and consequently are _combatants;_ but they are seldom _champions._ There may be _champions_ for causes as well as persons, and for bad as well as good causes; as _champions_ for liberty, for infidelity, and for Christianity. 

####combination 
**COMBINATION, CABAL, PLOT, CONSPIRACY.**  
_Combination_ (see **association** under [associate](entry://associate)). _Cabal_, in French _cabale_, comes from the Hebrew _kabala_, signifying a secret science pretended to by the Jewish rabbi, whence it is applied to any association that has a pretended secret. _Plot_, in French _complot_, is a word of unknown origin. _Plot_ in the sense of _plan_ may have developed from _plot_, a small portion, to _plot_ being to lay out in portions; from this familiar significance of the word may have developed its sinister meaning. _Conspiracy_, in French _conspiration_, from _con_ and _spirare_, to breathe together, signifies the having one spirit.  
An association for a bad purpose is the idea common to all these terms, and peculiar to _combination._ A _combination_ may be either secret or open, but secrecy forms a necessary part in the signification of the other terms; a _cabal_ is secret as to its end; a _plot_ and _conspiracy_ are secret both as to the means and the end. _Combination_ is the close adherence of many for their mutual defence in obtaining their demands or resisting the claims of others. A _cabal_ is the intrigue of a party or faction, formed by cunning practices in order to give a turn to the course of things to their own advantage: the natural and ruling idea in _cabal_ is that of assembling a number and manoeuvring secretly with address. A _plot_ is a clandestine union of some persons for the purpose of mischief: the ruling idea in a _plot_ is that of a complicated enterprise formed in secret, by two or more persons. A _conspiracy_ is a general intelligence among persons united to effect some serious change: the ruling and natural idea in this word is that of unanimity and concert in the prosecution of a plan.  
**COMBINATION, CABAL, JUNTO.** — A special term applied to a _combination_ or _cabal_ for political purposes is found in the word _junto_, from Spanish _junta_ (Latin _jungere_, to join), signifying a secret council or assembly, a select body of men combined secretly to effect some political aim. The form _junta_ refers specifically to the Grand Council of the State of Spain, and was adopted in 1895 by the Cuban insurgents to designate the representation of their cause in foreign countries. The form _junto_ is applicable to any secret gathering of men of a political character. It does not have the sinister significance of _cabal_, but, like _cabal_, it adds the idea of secrecy to that of _combination._

####come 
**COME, ARRIVE.**  
_Come_ is general; _arrive_ is particular.  
Persons or things _come;_ persons only, or what is personified, _arrives._ To _come_ specifies neither time nor manner; _arrival_ is employed with regard to some particular period or circumstance. The _coming_ of our Saviour was predicted by the prophets; the _arrival_ of a messenger is expected at a certain hour. We know that evils must _come_, but we do wisely not to meet them by anticipation; the _arrival_ of a vessel in the haven, after a long and dangerous voyage, is a circumstance of general interest in the neighborhood where it happens.

_Comfort_ (see [cheer](entry://cheer)). _Pleasure_, from to _please_, signifies what _pleases. Comfort_ describes a state of quiet enjoyment, a freedom from trouble, pain, or disquiet. It is applied also to the relief or strength afforded in time of weakness, oppression, or danger. The grand feature in _comfort_ is substantiality; in that of _pleasure is_ warmth. _Pleasure_ is quickly succeeded by pain; it is the lot of humanity that to every _pleasure_ there should be an alloy: _comfort_ is that portion of _pleasure_ which seems to he exempt from this disadvantage; it is the most durable sort of _pleasure. Comfort_ must be sought for at home; _pleasure_ is pursued abroad: _comfort_ depends upon a thousand nameless trifles which daily arise; it is the relief of a pain, the heightening of a gratification, the supply of a want, or the removal of an inconvenience. _Pleasure_ is the companion of luxury and abundance: it dwells in the palaces of the rich and the abodes of the voluptuary. _Comfort_ is less than _pleasure_ in the detail; it is more than _pleasure_ in the aggregate.

####command 
**COMMAND, ORDER, INJUNCTION, PRECEPT.**  
_Command_ is compounded of _con_, together, and _mandare_, or _dare in manus_, to give into the hand, signifying to give or appoint as a task. _Order_, in the extended sense of regularity, implies what is done in the way of _order_ or for the sake of regularity. _Injunction_ comes from _in_ and _jungo_, which signifies literally to join or bring close to; figuratively, to impress on the mind. _Enjoin_ is derived from the same Latin word. _Precept_, in French _précepte_, Latin _prœceptum_, participle of _prœcipio_, compounded of _prœ_ and _capere_, to take before, signifies the thing proposed to the mind.  
A _command_ is an exercise of power or authority; it is imperative and must be obeyed: an _order_ serves to direct; it is instructive and must be executed.  
_Command_ is properly the act of a superior or of one possessing power: _order_ has more respect to the office than to the person. A sovereign issues his _commands: orders_ may be given by a subordinate or by a body; as _orders_ in council, or _orders_ of a court.  
A _command_ may be divine or given from heaven; an _order_ or _injunction_ is given by men only.  
_Order_ is applied to the common concerns of life; _injunction_ and _precept_ to the moral conduct or duties of men. _Injunction_ imposes a duty by virtue of the authority which enjoins: the_ precept_ lays down or teaches such duties as already exist. See also [praise](entry://praise)

####commanding 
**COMMANDING, IMPERATIVE, IMPERIOUS, AUTHORITATIVE.**  
_Commanding_ signifies having the force of a _command_ (see above). _Imperative_, from Latin _imperare_, is derived from Latin _in_, and _parare_, to prepare, hence to order, arrange, command. _Imperious_, also from _imperare_, signifies in the way of, or like a _command. Authoritative_ signifies having authority, or in the way of _authority_ (for the derivation of which see [influence](entry://influence)).  
_Commanding_ is either good or bad, according to circumstances; a _commanding_ voice is necessary for one who has to command; but a _commanding_ air is offensive when it is affected: _imperative_ is applied to things, and used in an indifferent sense; _imperious_ is used for persons or things in the bad sense: any direction is _imperative_ which comes in the shape of a command, and circumstances are likewise _imperative_ which act with the force of a command: persons are _imperious_ who exercise their power oppressively; in this manner underlings in office are _imperious;_ necessity is _imperious_ when it leaves us no choice in our conduct. _Authoritative_ is mostly applied to persons or things personal in the good sense only; magistrates are called upon to assume an _authoritative_ air when they meet with any resistance.

####commission 
**COMMISSION, AUTHORIZE, EMPOWER.**  
_Commission_, from Latin _cum_, with, and _mittere_, to send, signifies the act of sending some one with authority, or putting into the hands of another. To _authorize_ signifies to give _authority;_ to _empower_, to put in possession of _power._ The idea of transferring some business to another is common to these terms; the circumstances under which this is performed constitute the difference. We _commission_ in ordinary cases; we _authorize_ and _empower_ in extraordinary cases. We _commission_ in matters where our own will and convenience are concerned; we _authorize_ in matters where our personal _authority_ is requisite; and we _empower_ in matters where the _authority_ of the law is required. A _commission_ is given by the bare communication of one's wishes; we _authorize_ by a positive and formal declaration to that intent; we _empower_ by the transfer of some legal document. A person is _commissioned_ to make a purchase; he is _authorized_ to communicate what has been confided to him; he is _empowered_ to receive money. _Commissioning_ passes mostly between equals; the performance of _commissions_ is an act of civility; _authorizing_ and _empowering_ are as often directed to inferiors; they are frequently acts of justice and necessity. Friends give one another _commissions;_ servants and subordinate persons are sometimes _authorized_ to act in the name of their employers; magistrates _empower_ the officers of justice to apprehend individuals or enter houses. We are _commissioned_ by persons only; we are _authorized_ sometimes by circumstances; we are _empowered_ by law. 

####commit

####commodious 
**COMMODIOUS, CONVENIENT.**  
_Commodious_, from the Latin _commodus_, or _con_ and _modus_, according to the measure and degree required. _Convenient_, from the Latin _conveniens_, participle of _con_ and _venire_, to come together, signifies that which comes together with something else as it ought.  
The _commodious_ is a species of the _convenient_, namely, that which men contrive for their convenience. _Commodious_ is therefore mostly applied to that which contributes to the bodily ease and comfort, _convenient_ to whatever suits the purposes of men in their various transactions: a house, a chair, or a place is _commodious;_ a time, an opportunity, a season, or the arrival of a person is _convenient._  
What is _commodious_ is rendered so by design; what is _convenient_ is so from the nature of the thing: in this sense arguments may be termed _commodious_ which favor a person's ruling propensity or passion. 

####commodity 
**COMMODITY, GOODS, MERCHANDISE, WARE.**  
These terms agree in expressing articles of trade under various circumstances. _Commodity_, in Latin _commoditas_, signifies in its abstract sense _convenience_, and in an extended application anything that is _convenient_ or fit for use. This being also salable, the word has been applied to things that are sold. _Goods_, from Anglo-Saxon _god_, fit, which denotes the thing that is good, has derived its use from the same analogy in its sense. _Merchandise_, from Latin _merx_, pay, Greek _μάρπτειν_, to seize, signifies salable things. (Compare the derivation of _mercy_ under the key-word CLEMENCY.) _Ware_, Anglo-Saxon _waru_, originally meant valuables, being allied to _waru_, signifying protection, guard, custody, etc.  
_Commodity_ is employed only for articles of the first necessity; it is the source of comfort and object of industry: _goods_ is applied to everything belonging to tradesmen for which there is a stipulated value; they are sold retail, and are the proper objects of trade: _merchandise_ applies to what belongs to merchants; it is the object of commerce: _wares_ are manufactured, and may be either goods or _merchandise;_ a country has its _commodities_, a shopkeeper his _goods_, a merchant his _merchandise_, a manufacturer his _wares._

####common 
**COMMON, VULGAR, ORDINARY, MEAN.**  
_Common_, in French _commun_, Latin _communis_, from _con_ and _munus_, the joint office or property of many, has regard to the multitude of objects. _Vulgar_, in French _vulgaire_, Latin _vulgaris_, from _vulgus_, the people, has regard to the number and quality of the persons. _Ordinary_, in French _ordinaire_, Latin _ordinarius_, from _ordo_, the order or regular practice, has regard to the repetition or disposition of things. _Mean_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _mœne_, which usually appears in the word _gemœne_, common (German _gemein);_ its meaning has been influenced by Latin _medius_, moderate, and by the English _mean_, the middle place, derived from that Latin word. Familiar use renders things _common, vulgar_, and _ordinary;_ but what is _mean_ is so of itself: the _common, vulgar_, and _ordinary_ are therefore frequently, though not always, _mean;_ and, on the contrary, what is _mean_ is not always _common, vulgar_, or _ordinary;_ consequently in the primitive sense of these words the first three are not strictly synonymous with the last: monsters are _common_ in Africa; _vulgar_ reports are little to be relied on; it is an _ordinary_ practice for men to make light of their word.  
In the figurative sense in which they convey the idea of low value they are synonymous with _mean;_ what is to be seen, heard, and enjoyed by everybody is _common_ and naturally of little value, since the worth of objects frequently depends upon their scarcity and the difficulty of obtaining them. What is peculiar to _common_ people is _vulgar_ and consequently worse than _common;_ it is supposed to belong to those who are ignorant and depraved in taste as well as in morals: what is done and seen _ordinarily_ may be done and seen easily; it requires no abilities or mental acquirements; it has nothing striking in it, it excites no interest: what is _mean_ is even below that which is _ordinary;_ there is something defective in it. _Common_ is opposed to rare and refined; _vulgar_, to polite and cultivated; _ordinary_, to the distinguished; _mean_, to the noble: a _common_ mind busies itself with _common_ objects; _vulgar_ habits are easily contracted from a slight intercourse with _vulgar_ people; an _ordinary_ person is seldom associated with elevation of character; and a _mean_ appearance is a certain mark of a degraded condition if not of a degraded mind.

**COMMONLY, GENERALLY, FREQUENTLY, USUALLY.** — _Commonly_, in the form of _common_ (see above). _Generally_, from _general_, and the Latin _genus_, the kind, respects a whole body in distinction to an individual. _Frequently_, from _frequent_, Latin _frequens_, is derived from a lost Latin verb, _frequere_, to cram, and signifies, properly, in a crowding manner. _Usually_, from Latin _usualis_, from _usus_, use, signifies according to _use_ or custom.  
What is _commonly_ done is an action _common_ to all; what is _generally_ done is the action of the greatest part; what is _frequently_ done is either the action of many or an action many times repeated by the same person; what is _usually_ done is done regularly by one or many. _Commonly_ is opposed to rarely; _generally_ and _frequently_, to occasionally or seldom; _usually_, to casually: men _commonly_ judge of others by themselves; those who judge by the mere exterior are _generally_ deceived; but notwithstanding every precaution one is _frequently_ exposed to gross frauds; a man of business _usually_ repairs to his counting-house every day at a certain hour. 

####common-carrier 
**COMMON-CARRIER, SHIPPER, TRANSPORTER.**  
_Common-carrier_ is one of two conspicuous legal and commercial terms applied to a person or company engaged in the business of carrying goods from one place to another for the general public and for pay; the other term being _private-carrier_, one who carries only for a particular customer and not for the general public, and who incurs no responsibility beyond that of ordinary diligence.  
A _common-carrier_ by land may be a railroad corporation, express company, stage-coach proprietor, a truckman, teamster, or porter, and a _common-carrier_ by water may be a steamship company, the master or owner of other ships and vessels engaged in transportation of goods, a lighterman, canal-boatman, ferryman, and others employed in like manner.  
A _shipper_ is one who puts goods on board the _ship;_ and is extended to refer to any one whose business it is to put goods on some means of conveyance for _transportation_ to another place. The _transporter_ (from Latin _trans_, across, and _portare_, to carry) is, strictly speaking, the person who carries the goods from one spot to another. A _common-carrier_ in America is a public _transporter_, and as such is bound by strict legal obligations defined by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 

####commonwealth 
See [state](entry://state)

####commotion 
**COMMOTION, DISTURBANCE.**  
_Commotion_, compounded of _cum_, together, and _movere_, signifying properly a motion of several together, expresses more than _disturbance_, which denotes the state of being _disturbed_ (see [trouble](entry://trouble)). When applied to physical objects, _commotion_ denotes the violent motion of several objects or of the several parts of any individual thing; _disturbance_ denotes any motion or noise which puts a thing out of its natural state. We speak of the _commotion_ of the elements, or the stillness of the night being _disturbed_ by the rustling of the leaves.  
In respect to men or animals, _commotion_ and _disturbance_ may be either inward or outward with a like distinction in their signification. A _commotion_ supposes a motion of all the feelings; a _disturbance_ of the mind may amount to no more than an interruption of the quiet to an indefinite degree.  
So in regard to external circumstances: a _commotion_ in public is occasioned by extraordinary circumstances, and is accompanied with unusual bustle and movement; whatever interrupts the peace of a neighborhood is a _disturbance:_ political events occasion a _commotion;_ drunkenness is a common cause of _disturbances_ in the streets or in families. 

####communicate 
**COMMUNICATE, IMPART.**  
To _communicate_, from the Latin _communis_, common, signifies to make common, or give a joint possession or enjoyment: to _impart_, from _in_ and _part_, signifies to give in part or make partaker. Both these words denote the giving some part of what one has in his power or possession; but the former is more general and indefinite in its signification and application than the latter. A thing may be _communicated_ directly or indirectly, and to any number of persons; as to _communicate_ intelligence by signal or otherwise. _Impart_ is a direct action that passes between individuals; as to _impart_ instruction.  
What is _communicated_ may be a matter of interest to the person _communicating_ or otherwise; but what is _imparted_ is commonly and properly that which interests both parties. A man may _communicate_ the secrets of another as well as his own; he _imparts_ his sentiments and feelings to a friend.  
**COMMUNION, CONVERSE.** — _Communion_, from _commune_ and _common_, signifies the act of making common. _Converse_, from Latin _con_ and _versari_, to dwell, from _vertere_, to turn, signifies the intercourse of those dwelling together.  
Both these terms imply a communication between minds; but the former may take place without corporeal agency, the latter never does; spirits hold _communion_ with one another; people hold _converse._ For the same reason a man may hold _communion_ with himself; he holds _converse_ always with another.

####communism 
See [socialism](entry://socialism)

####community 
**COMMUNITY, SOCIETY.**  
Both these terms are employed for a body of rational beings. _Community_, from _communitas_ and _communis_, common, signifies abstractly the state of being _common_, and in an extended sense those who are in a state of common possession. _Society_, in Latin _societas_, from _socius_, a companion, signifies the state of being companions, or those who are in that state.  
_Community_ in anything constitutes a _community;_ a common interest, a common language, a common government, is the basis of that _community_ which is formed by any number of individuals; the coming together of many and keeping together under given laws and for given purposes constitutes a _society; societies_ are either public or private, according to the purpose: friends form _societies_ for pleasure, indifferent persons form _societies_ for business. The term _community_ is therefore appropriately applied to indefinite numbers, and _society_ in cases where the number is restricted by the nature of the union.  
The term _community_ may likewise be applied to a small body, and in some cases be indifferently used for _society;_ but as it always retains its generality of meaning, the term _society_ is more proper where the idea of a close union, a tie, or obligation is to be expressed; as, every member of the _community_ is equally interested; every member of the _society_ is bound to contribute.

####comparison 
**COMPARISON, CONTRAST.**  
_Comparison_, Latin _comparo_, or _con_, together, and _par_, equal, signifies the putting together of equals. _Contrast_, in French _contraster_, Latin _contrasto_, or _contra_, against, and _stare_, to stand, signifies the placing one thing opposite to another.  
Likeness in the quality and difference in the degree are requisite for a _comparison;_ likeness in the degree and opposition in the quality are requisite for a _contrast:_ things of the same color are _compared;_ those of an opposite color are _contrasted:_ a _comparison_ is made between two shades of red: a _contrast_ between black and white. _Comparison_ is of a practical utility, it serves to ascertain the true relation of objects; _contrast_ is of utility among poets, it serves to heighten the effect of opposite qualities: things are large or small by _comparison;_ they are magnified or diminished in one's mind by _contrast:_ the value of a coin is best learned by _comparing_ it with another of the same metal; the generosity of one person is most strongly felt when _contrasted_ with the meanness of another.

####compassion 
See **pity** under [piteous](entry://piteous); [sympathy](entry://sympathy)

####compatible 
**COMPATIBLE, CONSISTENT.**  
_Compatible_, compounded of _com_ or _cum_, with, and _pati_, to suffer, signifies a fitness to be suffered together. _Consistent_, in Latin _consistens_, participle of _consiste_, compounded of _con_ and _sistere_, to cause to stand, to please, signifies the fitness to be placed together.  
_Compatibility_ has principally a reference to plans and measures; _consistency_, to character, conduct, and station. Everything is _compatible_ with a plan which does not interrupt its prosecution; everything is _consistent_ with a person's station by which it is neither degraded nor elevated. It is not _compatible_ with the good discipline of a school to allow of foreign interference; it is not _consistent_ with the elevated and dignified character of a clergyman to engage in the ordinary pursuits of other men. 

####compel 
**COMPEL, FORCE, OBLIGE, NECESSITATE.**  
All these terms denote the application of force either on the body or the mind in order to influence the conduct. To _compel_, from the Latin _con_ and _pello_, drive, signifying to drive to a specific point, denotes rather moral than physical force; but to _force_, from Latin _fors_, strong, signifying to effect by force, is properly applied to the use of physical force or a violent degree of moral force. A man may be _compelled_ to walk if he have no means of riding: he may be _forced_ to go at the will of another.  
These terms may, therefore, be applied to the same objects to denote different degrees of force.  
_Compel_ expresses a direct and powerful force on the will which leaves no choice. _Oblige_, from _ob_ and _ligare_, to bind, signifying to bind or keep down to a particular point, expresses only an indirect influence, which may be resisted or yielded at discretion; we are _compelled_ to do that which is repugnant to our will and our feelings; that which one is _obliged_ to do may have the assent of the judgment if not of the will. Wants _compel_ men to do many things which are inconsistent with their station and painful to their feelings. Honor and religion _oblige_ men scrupulously to observe their word one to another.  
_Compel, force_, and _oblige_ are mostly the acts of persons in the proper sense. _Necessitate_, which signifies to lay under a necessity, is properly the act of things. We are _necessitated_ by circumstances, or by anything which puts it out of our power to do otherwise.  
**COMPEL, IMPEL, CONSTRAIN, RESTRAIN.** — To _compel_ and _impel_ are both derived from the verb _pello_, to drive; the former, by the force of the preposition _com_, is to drive to any particular action or for a given purpose; but the latter, from the preposition _im_ or _in_, into, is to force into action generally. A person, therefore, is _compelled_ by outward circumstances, but he is _impelled_ from within: he is _compelled_ by another to go farther than he wished, he is _impelled_ by curiosity to go farther than he intended. _Constrain_ and _restrain_ are from _stringere_, to bind or oblige. The former, by force of the _con_ or _com_, to force in a particular manner or for a particular purpose; the latter by the _re_, back or again, is to keep back from anything. To _constrain_, like to _compel_, is to force to act; to _restrain_, to prevent from acting. _Constrain_ and _compel_ differ only in the degree of force used, _constrain_ signifying a less degree of force than _compel._ A person who is _compelled_ has no choice whatever left to him; but when he is only _constrained_ he may do it or not at discretion.  
_Constraint_ is put on the actions or movements of the body only, _restraint_ on the movements of both body and mind: a person who is in a state of _constraint_ shows his want of freedom in the awkwardness of his movements; he who is in a state of _restraint_ may be unable to move at all. _Constraint_ arises from that which is inherent in the person, _restraint_ is imposed upon him.

####compendium

####compensation 
**COMPENSATION, AMENDS, SATISFACTION, RECOMPENSE, REMUNERATION, REQUITAL, REWARD.**  
All these terms imply some return or equivalent for something else, good or bad. _Compensation_, from _cum_ and _pendere_, to weigh, signifies literally what is weighed with or against something else, hence paid for another thing. _Amends_, from _amend_, signifies that which amends or makes good. _Satisfaction_, that which satisfies or makes up something wanted. _Recompense_, from _pen-sum_, participle of _pendo_, that which pays back. _Remuneration_, from _munus_, a gift or reward, that which is given back by way of reward. _Requital_, from to _quit_, that which acquits in return. The first three of these terms denote a return or equivalent for something amiss or wanting; the last three a return for some good.  
A _compensation_ is a return for a loss or damage sustained; justice requires, that it should be equal in value, although not alike in kind.  
_Amends_ is a return for anything that is faulty in ourselves or toward others. A person may make _amends_ for idleness at one time by double portion of diligence at another.  
A man may make another _amends_ for any hardship done to him by showing him some extra favor another way.  
_Satisfaction_ is that which satisfies the individual requiring it; it is given for personal injuries, and may be made either by a slight return or otherwise, according to the disposition of the person to be satisfied. As regards man and man, affronts are often unreal, and the _satisfaction_ demanded is still oftener absurd and unchristian-like. As regards man and his Maker, _satisfaction_ is for our offences, which Divine Justice demands and Divine Mercy accepts.  
_Compensation_ and _amends_ may both denote a simple equivalent without any reference to that which is personal. A _compensation_ in this case may be an advantage one way to counterbalance a disadvantage another way. Or it may be the putting one desirable thing of equal value in the place of another.  
An _amends_ supplies a defect by something superabundant in another part.  
_Compensation_ is sometimes taken for a payment or some indefinite return for a service or good done: this brings it nearer in sense to the words _recompense_ and _remuneration_, with this difference, that the _compensation_ is given for bodily labor, or inferior services; _recompense_ and _remuneration_, for that which is done by persons in a superior condition. The time and strength of a poor man ought not to be used without his receiving a _compensation._  
A _recompense_ is a voluntary return for a voluntary service; it is made from a generous feeling, and derives its value not so much from the magnitude of the service or return as from the intentions of the parties toward each other; and it is received not so much as a matter of right as of courtesy: there are a thousand acts of civility performed by others which may be entitled to some _recompense. Remuneration_ is not so voluntary as _recompense_, but it is equally indefinite, being estimated rather according to the condition of the person and the dignity of the service than its positive worth. Authors often receive a _remuneration_ for their works according to the reputation they have previously acquired, and not according to the real merit of the work.  
_Requital_ is the return of a kindness, the making it is an act of gratitude. _Reward_, from _ward_, and the German _währen_, to see, signifies properly a looking back upon — _i.e._, a return that has respect to something else. A _reward_ conveys no idea of an obligation on the part of the person making it; whoever _rewards_ acts optionally. It is the conduct which produces the _reward_, and consequently this term, unlike all the others, denotes a return for either good or evil. Whatever accrues to a man and the consequences of his conduct, be it good or bad, is a _reward._ The _reward_ of industry is ease and content.  
When a deceiver is caught in his own snare, he meets with the _reward_ which should always attend deceit.  
A _compensation, recompense, requital_, and _reward_ may be a bad as well as a good return. That which ill supplies the thing wanted is a bad _compensation;_ honor is but a poor _compensation_ for the loss of health.  
That which does not answer one's expectations is a bad _recompense;_ there are many things which people pursue with much eagerness that do not _recompense_ the trouble bestowed upon them.  
When evil is returned for good, that is a bad _requital_, and, as a proof of ingratitude, wounds the feelings. Those who befriend the wicked may expect to be ill _requited._  
A _reward_ may be a bad return when it is inadequate to the merits of the person. 

####competent 
**COMPETENT, FITTED, QUALIFIED.**  
_Competent_, from _con_, together, and _petere_, to seek, signifies suitable (literally, seeking that which belongs to one). _Fitted_, from _fit_ (see [becoming](entry://becoming)). _Qualified_, participle of _qualify_, from the Latin _qualis_, how much, and _facere_, to make, signifies made as much as it ought to be, measured up to a standard.  
_Competency_ mostly respects the mental endowments and attainments; _fitness_, the disposition and character; _qualification_ the artificial acquirements or natural qualities. A person is _competent_ to undertake an office; _fitted_ or _qualified_ to fill a situation. Familiarity with any subject aided by strong mental endowments gives _competency:_ suitable habits and temper constitute the _fitness:_ acquaintance with the business to be done, and expertness in the mode of performing it, constitute the _qualification:_ none should pretend to give their opinions on serious subjects who are not _competent_ judges; none but lawyers are _competent_ to decide in oases of law; none but medical men are _competent_ to prescribe medicines: none but divines of sound learning, as well as piety, to determine on doctrinal questions: men of sedentary and studious habits, with a serious temper, are most _fitted_ to be clergymen: and those who have the most learning and acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures are the best _qualified_ for the important and sacred office of instructing the people. Many are _qualified_ for managing the concerns of others who would not be _competent_ to manage a concern for themselves. Many who are _fitted_, from their turn of mind, for any particular charge may be unfortunately _incompetent_ for want of the requisite _qualifications._

####competition 
**COMPETITION, EMULATION, RIVALRY.**  
_Competition_, from the Latin _competo_, compounded of _con_ and _peto_, signifies to sue or seek together, to seek for the same object. _Emulation_ comes from Latin _œmulus_, which means striving to be equal. _Rivalry_, from the Latin _rivus_, the bank of a stream, signifies the undivided or common enjoyment of any stream, which in olden times was a natural source of discord and led to _rivalry Competition_ is properly an act, _emulation_ is a feeling or temper of mind which incites to action, and _emulation_, therefore, frequently furnishes the motive for _competition;_ the bare action of seeking the same object constitutes the _competition;_ the desire of excelling is the principal characteristic in _emulation. Competition_, therefore, applies to matters either of interest or honor where more than one person strive to gain a particular object, as _competition_ for the purchase of a commodity or for a prize. _Emulation_ is confined to matters that admit of superiority and distinction.  
_Rivalry_ resembles _emulation_ as far as it has most respect to the feeling, and _competition_ as far as it has respect to the action. But _competition_ and _emulation_ have for the most part a laudable object, and proceed in the attainment of it by honest means; _rivalry_ has always a selfish object, and is often but little scrupulous in the choice of the means: a _competitor_ may be unfair, but a _rival_ is very rarely generous. There are _competitors_ for office, or _competitors_ at public games, and _rivals_ for the favor of others.  
When _emulation_ degenerates into a desire for petty distinctions it is akin to _rivalry. Competitors_ must always come in close collision, as they seek for the same individual thing; but _rivals_ may act at a distance, as they only work toward the same point: there may be _rivalry_ between states which vie with one another in greatness or power, but there cannot properly be _competition._

####complain 
**COMPLAIN, LAMENT, REGRET.**  
_Complain_, French _complaindre_ or _plaindre_, Latin _plango_, to beat the breast as a sign of grief. _Lament_ (see [bewail](entry://bewail)). _Regret_ comes through French from Latin _re_ and a Scandinavian verb found in Anglo-Saxon _grœtan_, to bewail.  
_Complaint_ marks most of dissatisfaction; _lamentation_, most of grief; _regret_, most of pain. _Complaint_ is expressed verbally; _lamentation_, either by words or signs; _regret_ may be felt without being expressed. _Complaint_ is made of personal grievances; _lamentation_ and _regret_ may be made on account of others as well as ourselves. We _complain_ of our ill health, of our inconveniences, or of troublesome circumstances; we _lament_ our inability to serve another; we _regret_ the absence of one whom we love. Selfish people have the most to _complain_ of, as. they demand most of others and are most liable to be disappointed; anxious people are the most liable to _lament_, as they feel everything strongly; the best-regulated mind may have occasion to _regret_ some circumstances which give pain to the tender affections of the heart.  
We may _complain_ without any cause, and _lament_ beyond what the cause requires; but _regret_ is always founded on some real cause, and never exceeds in measure.  
**COMPLAIN, MURMUR, REPINE.** — _Complain_ (see above). _Murmur_ is a word of imitative origin, from Latin _murmur_, Sanskrit _marmara_, the rustling sound of the wind; hence a low complaining. _Repine_ is compounded of _re_ and _pine_, from Anglo-Saxon _pin_, pain, Latin _pœna_, punishment, and Greek _ποινή_, penalty, signifying to think on with pain.  
The idea of expressing displeasure or dissatisfaction of what is done by others is common to these terms. _Complaint_ is not so loud as _murmuring_, but more so than _repining._ We _complain_ or _murmur_ by some audible method; we may _repine_ secretly. _Complaints_ are always addressed to some one; _murmurs_ and _repinings_ are often addressed only to one's self. _Complaints_ are made of whatever creates uneasiness, without regard to the source from winch they flow; _murmurings_ are a species of _complaints_ made only of that which is done by others for our inconvenience; when used in relation to persons, _complaint_ is the act of a superior, or of one who has a right to express his dissatisfaction; _murmuring_, that of an inferior, or one who is subject to another. When the conduct of another offends, it calls for _complaint;_ when a superior aggrieves by the imposition of what is burdensome, it occasions _murmuring_ on the part of the aggrieved.  
_Complain_ and _murmur_ may sometimes signify to be dissatisfied simply, without implying any direct expression which brings them nearer to the word _repine;_ in this case _complain_ expresses a less violent dissatisfaction than _murmur_, and both more than _repine_, which implies what is deep-seated. With this distinction they may all be employed to denote the dissatisfaction produced by events that inevitably happen. Men may be said to _complain, murmur_, or _repine_ at their lot.  
**COMPLAINT, ACCUSATION.** — _Complaint_ (see preceding term). _Accusation_ (see [accuse](entry://accuse)). Both these terms are employed in regard to the conduct of others, but a _complaint_ is mostly made in matters that personally affect the _complainant;_ an _accusation_ is made of matters in general, but especially those of a moral nature. A _complaint_ is made for the sake of obtaining redress; an _accusation_ is made for the sake of ascertaining a fact or bringing to punishment. A _complaint_ may be frivolous, an _accusation_ false. People in subordinate stations should be careful to give no cause for _complaint:_ the most guarded conduct will not protect any person from the unjust _accusations_ of the malevolent. 

####complaisance 
**COMPLAISANCE, DEFERENCE, CONDESCENSION.**  
_Complaisance_, from the present participle of French _complaire_ (Latin _complacere_, please), signifies the act of complying with, or pleasing others. _Deference_, in French _déférence_, from the Latin _defero_, to bear down, marks the inclination to defer, or acquiesce in the sentiments of another in preference to one's own. _Condescension_, from Latin _con_, with, and _descendere_, to descend, means the _descending_ from one's own height to comply with the wishes of others.  
The necessities, the conveniences, the accommodations and allurements of society, of familiarity, and of intimacy lead to _complaisance:_ it makes sacrifices to the wishes, tastes, comforts, enjoyments, and personal feelings of others. Age, rank, dignity, and personal merit call for _deference:_ it enjoins compliance with respect to our opinions, judgments, pretensions, and designs. The infirmities, the wants, the defects and foibles of others call for _condescension:_ it relaxes the rigor of authority and removes the distinction of rank or station. _Complaisance_ is the act of an equal; _deference_, that of an inferior; _condescension_, that of a superior. _Complaisance_ is due from one well-bred person to another; _deference_ is due to all superiors in age, knowledge, or station whom one approaches; _condescension_ is due from all superiors to such as are dependent on them for comfort and enjoyment. All these qualities spring from a refinement of humanity; but _complaisance_ has most of genuine kindness in its nature; _deference_, most of respectful submission; _condescension_, most of easy indulgence.

####complete 
**COMPLETE, PERFECT, FINISHED.**  
_Complete_, in French _complet_, Latin _computus_, participle of _complere_, to fill up, signifies the quality of being filled, or having all that is necessary. _Perfect_, in Latin _perfectus_, participle of _perficere_, from _per_, through, and _facere_, to do, signifies the state of being done thoroughly. _Finished_, from _finish_ (see [close](entry://close)), marks the state of being _finished._  
That is _complete_ which has no deficiency: that is _perfect_ which has positive excellence; and that is _finished_ which has no omission in it. That to which anything can be added is _incomplete;_ when it can be improved, it is _imperfect;_ when more labor ought to be bestowed upon it, it is _unfinished._ A thing is _complete_ in all its parts; _perfect_ as to the beauty and design of the construction; and _finished_ as it comes from the hand of the workman and answers his intention. A set of books is not _complete_ when a volume is wanting: there is nothing in the proper 3ense _perfect_ which is the work of man, but the term is used relatively for whatever makes the greatest approach to _perfection:_ a _finished_ performance evinces care and diligence on the part of the workman. These terms admit of the same distinction when applied to moral or intellectual objects.  
See also [whole](entry://whole)  
**COMPLETE, FINISH, TERMINATE.** — We _complete_, that is, make complete, what is undertaken by continuing to labor at it. We _finish_ what is begun in a state of forwardness by putting the last hand to it. We _terminate_ what ought not to last by bringing it to a close, from _terminus_, a term,, a boundary, signifying to set bounds to a thing.  
The characteristic idea of _completing_ is that of making a thing altogether what it ought to be; that of _finishing_ the doing all that is intended to be done toward a thing; and that of _terminating_, simply putting an end to a thing. _Completing_ has properly relation to permanent works only, whether mechanical or intellectual; we desire a thing to be _completed_ from a curiosity to see it in its entire state. To _finish_ is employed for passing occupations; we wish a thing _finished_ from an anxiety to proceed to something else, or a dislike to the thing in which we are engaged. _Terminating_ respects space or time: a view may be _terminated_, a life may be _terminated_, or that to which one may put a term, as to _terminate_ a dispute. Light minds undertake many things without _completing_ any. Children and unsteady people set about many things without _finishing_ any. Litigious people _terminate_ one dispute only to commence another.

####complexity 
**COMPLEXITY, COMPLICATION, INTRICACY.**  
_Complexity_ and _complication_, in French _complication_, compounded of _con_, with, and _plectere_, to plait, allied to _plicare_, to twine, signifies a plaiting together of two different things — an interweaving. _Intricacy_, Latin _intricatio_ and _intrico_, compounded of _in_ and _tricœ_, perplexities, signifies a state of entanglement.  
_Complexity_ expresses the abstract quality or state; _complication_ the act: they both convey less than _intricacy; intricate_ is that which is very _complicated. Complexity_ arises from a multitude of objects and the nature of these objects; _complication_, from an involvement of objects; and _intricacy_, from a winding and confused involution. What is _complex_ must be decomposed; what is _complicated_ must be developed; what is _intricate_ must be unraveled. A proposition is _complex_, affairs are _complicated;_ the law is _intricate._ The _complexity_ of a subject often deters young persons from application to their business. There is nothing embarrasses a physician more than a _complication_ of disorders, where the remedy for one impedes the cure for the other. Some affairs are involved in such a degree of _intricacy_ as to exhaust the patience and perseverance of the most laborious. 

####compliment 
See [adulate](entry://adulate)

####comply 
**COMPLY, CONFORM, YIELD, SUBMIT.**  
_Comply_ (see [agree](entry://agree)). _Conform_, compounded of _con_ and _formare_, signifies to put into the same _form. Yield_ (see [agree](entry://agree)). _Submit_, in Latin _submitto_, compounded of _sub_, under, and _mittere_, to send, signifies to put under, that is to say, to put one's self under another person. _Compliance_ and _conformity_ are voluntary; _yielding_ and _submission_ are involuntary. _Compliance is_ an act of the inclination; _conformity_ an act of the judgment: _compliance is_ altogether optional; we _comply_ with a thing or not, at pleasure; _conformity_ is binding on the conscience; it relates to matters in which there is a right and a wrong. _Compliance_ with the fashions and customs of those we live with is a natural propensity of the human mind that may be mostly indulged without impropriety; _conformity_ in religious matters, though not to be enforced by human law, is not on that account less binding on the consciences of every member of the community; the violation of this duty on trivial grounds involves in it that of more than one breach of the moral law.  
_Compliance_ and _conformity_ are produced by no external action on the mind; they flow spontaneously from the will and understanding: _yielding_ is altogether the result of foreign agency. We _comply_ with a wish as soon as it is known; it accords with our feelings so to do: we _yield_ to the entreaties of others; it is the effect of persuasion, a constraint upon or at least a direction of the inclination. We _conform_ to the regulations of a community, it is a matter of discretion; we _yield_ to the superior judgment of another, we have no choice or alternative. We _comply_ cheerfully; we _conform_ willingly; we _yield_ reluctantly. A cheerful _compliance_ with the requests of a friend is the sincerest proof of friendship: the wisest and most learned of men have ever been the readiest to _conform_ to the general sense of the community in which they live: the harmony of social life is frequently disturbed by the reluctance which men have to _yield_ to one another.  
To _yield_ is to give way to another, either with one's will, judgment, or outward conduct: _submission_ is the giving up of one s self altogether; it is the substitution of another's will for one's own. _Yielding_ is partial; we may _yield_ in one case or in one action, though not in another: _submission_ is general; it includes a system of conduct.  
We _yield_ when we do not resist; this may sometimes be the act of a superior: we _submit_ only by adopting the measures and conduct proposed to us; this always is the act of an inferior. _Yielding_ may be produced by means more or less gentle, by enticing or insinuating arts, or by the force of argument; _submission_ is made only to power or positive force: one _yields_ after a struggle; one _submits_ without resistance: we _yield_ to ourselves or others; we _submit_ to others only: it is a weakness to _yield_ either to the suggestions of others or our own inclinations to do that which our judgments condemn; it is a folly to _submit_ to the caprice of any one where there is not a moral obligation: it is obstinacy not to _yield_ when one's adversary has the advantage; it is sinful not to _submit_ to constituted authorities. See also [agree](entry://agree)  
**COMPLIANT, YIELDING, SUBMISSIVE.** — These epithets from the preceding verbs serve to designate a propensity to the respective actions, which may be excessive or otherwise. A _compliant_ temper _complies_ with every wish of another, good or bad: a _yielding_ temper leans to every opinion, right or wrong; a _submissive_ temper _submits_ to every demand, just or unjust. A _complaint_ person may want command of feeling; a _yielding_ person may want fixedness of principle; a _submissive_ person may want resolution: a too _complaint_ disposition will be imposed upon by the selfish and unreasonable; a too _yielding_ disposition is most unfit for commanding; a too _submissive_ disposition exposes a person to the exactions of tyranny. 

####compose 
**COMPOSE, SETTLE.**  
_Compose_ is derived through French from Greek _παύσις._ a pause. "One of the most, remarkable facts of French etymology is the extraordinary substitution whereby Late Latin _pausare_, from Greek, coming to mean to cause to rest, usurped the place of Latin _ponere_, with which it had no etymological connection at all; so that the compounds of _pausare (compausare_, French _composer_, for example) usurped the place of the compounds of Latin _ponere_, like _componere_, throughout" (Skeat). _Settle_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _setlan_, to fix, from _setl_, a seat, Modern English _settle_, a seat.  
We _compose_ that which has been disjointed and separated by bringing it together again; we _settle_ that which has been disturbed and put in motion by making it rest: we _compose_ our thoughts when they have been deranged and thrown into confusion: we _settle_ our mind when it has been fluctuating and distracted by contending desires; the mind must be _composed_ before we can think justly; it must be _settled_ before we can act consistently.  
Differences are _composed_ where there are jarring and discord; it is effected by conciliation, differences are _settled_ when they are brought to a final arrangement by consultation or otherwise. In this manner a person may be said to _compose_ himself, his thoughts, his dress, and the like; to _settle_ matters, points, questions, etc. It is a good thing to _compose_ differences between friends; it is not always easy to _settle_ questions where either party is obstinate.

**COMPOSED, SEDATE.** — _Composed_ signifies the state or quality of being in order, or free from confusion or perturbation; it is applied either to the mind or to the air, manner, or carriage. _Sedate_, in Latin _sedatus_, from Latin _sedare_, to make calm, causative of _sedere_, to sit (compare _sedative)_, signifies properly the quality of being settled (see [compose](entry://compose)), _i.e._, free from irregular motion, and is applied either to the carriage or the temper. _Composed_ is opposite to ruffled or hurried, and is a temporary state; _sedate_ is opposed to buoyant or volatile, and is a permanent habit of the mind or body. A person may be _composed_ or his carriage may be _composed_ in moments of excitement. Young people are rarely _sedate._  
See also [calm](entry://calm); [synthetic](entry://synthetic)

####compound 
**COMPOUND, COMPLEX.**  
_Compound_ comes from the present of _componere_, to place together. _Complex_ (see [complexity](entry://complexity)).  
The _compound_ consists of similar and whole bodies put together; the _complex_ consists of various parts linked together: adhesion is sufficient to constitute a _compound;_ involution is requisite for the _complex;_ we distinguish the whole that forms the _compound;_ we separate the parts that form the _complex;_ what is _compound_ may consist only of. two; what is _complex_ consists always of several. _Compound_ and _complex_ are both commonly opposed to the simple; but the former may be opposed to the single, and the latter to the simple: words are _compounded_, sentences are _complex._  
**COMPOUND, COMPOSE.** — _Compound_ and _compose_ (see [compose](entry://compose)). _Compound_ is used in the physical sense only; _compose_ in the proper or the moral sense; words are _compounded_ by making two or more into one; sentences are _composed_ by putting words together so as to make sense: a medicine is _compounded_ of many ingredients; society is _composed_ of various classes. 

####comprehend 
See [comprise](entry://comprise); [conceive](entry://conceive)

####comprehensive 
**COMPREHENSIVE, EXTENSIVE.**  
_Comprehensive_, from _comprehend_, in Latin _comprehendo_, from _con_, together, and _prehendere_, to take, signifies the quality of putting together. _Extensive_, from _extend_, in Latin _extendo_, or _ex_ and _tendere_, to stretch out, signifies the quality of reaching to a distance.  
_Comprehensive_ respects quantity, _extensive_ regards space: that is _comprehensive_ which _extends_ into a wide field: a _comprehensive_ view of a subject includes all branches of it; an _extensive_ view of a subject enters into minute details: the _comprehensive_ is associated with the concise; the _extensive_ with the diffuse: it requires a capacious mind to take a _comprehensive_ survey of any subject; it is possible for a superficial thinker to enter very _extensively_ into some parts, while he passes over others. _Comprehensive_ is employed only with regard to intellectual objects; _extensive_ is used both in the proper or the improper sense: the signification of a word is _comprehensive_, or the powers of the mind are _comprehensive:_ a plain is _extensive_, or a field of inquiry is _extensive._

####comprise 
**COMPRISE, COMPREHEND, EMBRACE, CONTAIN, INCLUDE.**  
_Comprise_, through the French _compris_, participle of _comprendre_, comes from the same source as _comprehend. Embrace_ (see [clasp](entry://clasp)). _Contain_, in French _contenir_, Latin _contineo_, compounded of _con_ and _teneo_, signifies to hold together within one place. _Include_, in Latin _includo_, compounded of _in_ and _cludo_ or _claudo_, signifies to shut in or within a given space.  
_Comprise, comprehend_, and _embrace_ have regard to the aggregate value, quantity, or extent; _include_, to the individual things which form the whole; _contain_, either to the aggregate or to the individual, being in fact a term of more ordinary application than any of the others. _Comprise_ and _contain_ are used either in the proper or the figurative sense; _comprehend, embrace_, and _include_ in the figurative sense only: a stock _comprises_ a variety of articles; a library _comprises_ a variety of books; the whole is _comprised_ within a small compass; rules _comprehend_ a number of particulars; laws _comprehend_ a number of cases; countries _comprehend_ a certain number of districts or divisions; terms _comprehend_ a certain meaning: a discourse _embraces_ a variety of topics; a plan, project, scheme, or system _embraces_ a variety of objects; a house _contains_ one, two, or more persons; a city _contains_ a number of houses; a book _contains_ much useful matter; a society _contains_ very many individuals; it _includes_ none but of a certain class; or it _includes_ some of every class.

####conceal 
**CONCEAL, DISSEMBLE, DISGUISE.**  
_Conceal_ is compounded of Latin _con_ and _celare_, to hide. _Dissemble_, in French _dissimuler_, compounded of _dis_, negative prefix, and _similis_, like, signifies to make a thing appear unlike what it is. _Disguise_, in French _déguiser_, compounded of the privative _dis or de_ and _guise_, in Old High German _wise_, a manner or fashion, signifies to take a form opposite to the reality.  
To _conceal_ is simply to abstain from making known what we wish to keep secret; to _dissemble_ and _disguise_ signify to _conceal_ by assuming some false appearance: we _conceal_ facts; we _dissemble_ feelings; we _disguise_ sentiments. Caution only is requisite in _concealing;_ it may be effected by simple silence: art and address must be employed in _dissembling;_ it mingles falsehood with all its proceedings; labor and cunning are requisite in _disguising;_ it has nothing but falsehood in all its movements. The _concealer_ watches over himself that he may not be betrayed into any indiscreet communication; the _dissembler_ has an eye to others, so as to prevent them from discovering the state of his heart; _disguise_ assumes altogether a different face from reality, and rests secure under this shelter. It is sufficient to _conceal_ from those who either cannot or will not see; it is necessary to _dissemble_ with those who can see without being shown; but it is necessary to _disguise_ from those who are anxious to discover and use every means to penetrate the veil that intercepts their sight.  
**CONCEAL, HIDE, SECRETE.** — _Conceal_ (see above). _Hide_, Anglo-Saxon _hydan_, is allied to Greek κεύθειν, to cover or put out of sight. _Secrete_, in Latin _secretus_, participle of _secerno_, or se, apart, and _cernere_, to separate, means to take away and hide in a place apart.  
_Concealing_ has simply the idea of not letting come to observation; _hiding_, that of putting under cover; _secreting_, that of setting at a distance or in unfrequented places: whatever is not seen is _concealed_, but whatever is _hidden_ or _secreted_ is intentionally put out of sight: a person _conceals_ himself behind a hedge; he _hides_ his treasures in the earth; he _secretes_ what he has stolen under his cloak. _Conceal_ is more general than either _hide_ or _secrete:_ all things are _concealed_ which are _hidden_ or _secreted_, but they are not always _hidden_ or _secreted_ when they are _concealed:_ both mental and corporeal objects are _concealed;_ corporeal objects mostly, and sometimes mental ones, are _hidden;_ corporeal objects only are _secreted:_ we _conceal_ in the mind whatever we do not make known: that is _hidden_ which may not be discovered or cannot be discerned; that is _secreted_ which may not be seen. Facts are _concealed_, truths are _hidden_, goods are _secreted._ Children should never attempt to _conceal_ from their parents or teachers any error they have committed when called upon for an acknowledgment; we are told in Scripture, for our consolation, that nothing is _hidden_ which shall not be revealed; people seldom wish to _secrete_ anything but with the intention of _concealing_ it from those who have a right to demand it back.  
**CONCEALMENT, SECRECY.** — _Concealment_ is itself an action; _secrecy_, from _secret_, is the quality of an action: _concealment_ may respect the state of things; _secrecy_ the conduct of persons; things may be _concealed_ so as to be known to no one; but _secrecy_ supposes some person to whom the thing _concealed_ is known. _Concealment_ has to do with what concerns others; _secrecy_, with that which concerns ourselves: what is _concealed_ is kept from the observation of others; what is _secret_ is known only to ourselves: there may frequently be _concealment_ without _secrecy_, although there cannot be _secrecy_ without _concealment: concealment_ is frequently practised to the detriment of others; _secrecy_ is always adopted for our own advantage or gratification: _concealment_ is essential in the commission of crimes; _secrecy_ in the execution of schemes: many crimes are committed with impunity when the perpetrators are protected by _concealment;_ the best-concerted plans are often frustrated for want of observing _secrecy._

####conceit 
**CONCEIT, FANCY.**  
_Conceit_ comes immediately from the Latin _conceptus_, participle of _concipere_, from _con_, together, and _capere_, take, and means to take and put together, to conceive or form in the mind. _Fancy_, in French phantasie. Latin _phantasia_, Greek _φαντασία_, from _φαντάζω_, make appear, and _φαίνω_, appear.  
These terms equally express the working of the imagination in its distorted state; but _conceit_ denotes a much greater degree of distortion than _fancy:_ our _conceits_ are preposterous; what we _fancy_ is unreal or only apparent, _Conceit_ applies only to internal objects: it is mental in the operation and the result; it is a species of invention: _fancy_ is applied to external objects, or whatever acts on the senses: nervous people are subject to strange _conceits;_ timid people _fancy_ they hear sounds or see objects in the dark which awaken terror. Those who are apt to _conceit_ oftener _conceit_ that which is painful than otherwise; _conceiting_ either that they are always in danger of dying, or that all the world is their enemy. There are, however, insane people who _conceit_ themselves to be kings and queens: and some, indeed, who are not called insane, who _conceit_ themselves very learned while they know nothing, or very wise and clever while they are exposing themselves to perpetual ridicule for their folly, or very handsome while the world calls them plain, or very peaceable while they are always quarrelling with their neighbors, or very humble while they are tenaciously stickling for their own: it would be well if such _conceits_ afforded a harmless pleasure to their authors, but unfortunately they only render them more offensive and disgusting than they would otherwise be. Those who are apt to _fancy_ never _fancy_ anything to please themselves: they _fancy_ that things are too long or too short, too thick or too thin, too cold or too hot, with a thousand other _fancies_ equally trivial in their nature, thereby proving that the slightest aberration of the mind is a serious evil, and productive of evil.  
When taken in reference to intellectual objects, _conceit_ is always in a bad sense; but _fancy_ may be employed in a good sense.

####conceited 
See [opinionated](entry://opinionated)

####conceive 
**CONCEIVE, UNDERSTAND, COMPREHEND.**  
_Conceive_ has the same derivation as _conceit. Understand_ signifies to stand under, or near to the mind. _Comprehend_, in Latin _comprehendo_, compounded of _con_, together, and _prehendere_, to sieze, signifies to seize or embrace within the mind.  
These terms indicate the intellectual operations of forming ideas, that is, ideas of the complex kind, in distinction from the simple ideas formed by the act of perception. _Conception_ is the simplest operation of the three; when we _conceive_ we may have but one idea; when we _understand_ or _comprehend_ we have all the ideas which the subject is capable of presenting. We cannot _understand_ or _comprehend_ without _conceiving;_ but we may often _conceive_ that which we neither _understand_ nor _comprehend._ That which we cannot _conceive_ is to us nothing; but the _conception_ of it gives it an existence, at least in our minds; but _understanding_ and_ comprehending_ is not essential to the belief of a thing's existence. So long as we have reasons sufficient; to _conceive_ a thing as possible or probable, it is not necessary either to _understand_ or _comprehend_ it in order to authorize our belief. The mysteries of our holy religion are objects of _conception_, but not of _comprehension._ We _conceive_ that a thing may be done without _understanding_ how it is done; we _conceive_ that a thing may exist without _comprehending_ the nature of its existence. We _conceive_ clearly, _understand_ fully, _comprehend_ minutely.  
_Conceiving_ is a species of invention; it is the fruit of the mind's operation within itself. _Understanding_ and _comprehension_ are employed solely on external objects; we _understand_ and _comprehend_ that which actually exists before us and presents itself to our observation. _Conceiving_ is the office of the imagination as well as the judgment; _understanding_ and _comprehension_ are the office of the reasoning faculties exclusively.  
_Conceiving_ is employed with regard to matters of taste, to arrangements, designs, and projects; _understanding_ is employed on familiar objects which present themselves in the ordinary discourse and business of men; _comprehending_ respects principles, lessons, and speculative knowledge in general. The artist _conceives_ a design, and he who will execute it must _understand_ it: the poet _conceives_ that which is grand and sublime, and he who will enjoy the perusal of his _conceptions_ must have refinement of mind, and capacity to _comprehend_, the grand and sublime. The builder _conceives_ plans, the scholar _understands_ languages, the metaphysician attempts to explain many things which are not to be _comprehended._  
See also [apprehend](entry://apprehend)  
**CONCEPTION, NOTION.** — _Conception_, from _conceive_, signifies the thing _conceived. Notion_, in French _notion_, Latin _notio_, from _notus_, the participle of _noscere_, to know, signifies the thing known.  
_Conception_ is the mind's own work, what it pictures to itself from the exercise of its own powers; _notion_ is the representation of objects as they are drawn from observation. _Conceptions_ are the fruit of the understanding and imagination; _notions_ are the result of experience and information. _Conceptions_ are formed; _notions_ are entertained. _Conceptions_ are either grand or mean, gross or sublime; either clear or indistinct, crude or distinct; _notions_ are either true or false, just or absurd. Intellectual culture serves to elevate men's _conceptions;_ the extension of knowledge serves to correct and refine their _notions._  
Some heathen philosophers had an indistinct _conception_ of the Deity, whose attributes and character are unfolded to us in His revelation: the ignorant have often false _notions_ of their duty and obligations to their superiors. The unenlightened express their gross and crude _conceptions_ of a Superior Being by some material and visible object: the vulgar _notion_ of ghosts and spirits is not entirely banished from the most cultivated parts of any country.

####concert 
**CONCERT, CONTRIVE, MANAGE.**  
_Concert_ is derived from Latin _concertare_, from _con_, together, and _certare_, to strive, and signified to strive together, to vie. _Contrive_ comes from Old French _controver_, to find together. _Manage_, in French _ménager_, comes from Latin _manus_, hand, and means to control with the hand.  
There is a secret understanding in _concerting;_ invention in _contriving;_ execution in _managing._ There is mostly _contrivance_ and _managing_ in _concerting;_ but there is not always _concerting_ in _contrivance_ or _management._ Measures are _concerted;_ schemes are _contrived;_ affairs are _managed._ Two parties at least are requisite in _concerting_, one is sufficient for _contriving_ and _managing. Concerting_ is always employed in all secret transactions; _contrivance_ and _management_ are used indifferently. Robbers who have determined on any scheme of plunder _concert_ together the means of carrying their project into execution; they _contrive_ various devices to elude the vigilance of the police; they _manage_ everything in the dark. Those who are debarred the opportunity of seeing one another unrestrainedly _concert_ measures for meeting privately. The ingenuity of a person is frequently displayed in the _contrivances_ by which he strives to help himself out of his troubles. Whenever there are many parties interested in a concern, it is never so well _managed_ as when it is in the hands of one individual suitably qualified. 

####conciliate 
**CONCILIATE, RECONCILE.**  
_Conciliate_, in Latin _conciliatus_, and _reconcile_, in Latin _reconcilie_, both come from _conciliare_, to bring together, whence _council_ is also derived, and denote an achieving of unity and harmony.  
_Conciliate_ and _reconcile_ are both employed in the sense of uniting men's affections, but under different circumstances. The _conciliator_ gets the goodwill and affections for himself; the _reconciler_ unites the affections of two persons to each other. The _conciliator_ may either gain new affections or regain those which are lost; the _reconciler_ always either renews affections which have been once lost or fixes them where they ought to be fixed. The best means of _conciliating_ esteem is by _reconciling_ all that are at variance. _Conciliate_ is mostly employed for men in public stations; _reconcile_ is indifferently employed for those in public or private stations. Men in power have sometimes the happy opportunity of _conciliating_ the good-will of those who are most averse to their authority, and thus _reconciling_ them to measures winch would otherwise be odious. Kindness and condescension serve to _conciliate;_ a friendly influence, or a well-timed exercise of authority, is often successfully exerted in _reconciling. Conciliate_ is mostly employed in the sense of bringing persons into unison with each other who have been at variance; but _reconcile_ may be employed to denote the bringing a person into unison or acquiescence with that which would be naturally disagreeable.

####conclusion 
**CONCLUSION, INFERENCE, DEDUCTION.**  
_Conclusion_, from Latin _concludere_, compounded of _con_, together, and _claudere_, close, signifies the closing up of all arguments and reasoning. _Inference_, from _infer_, in Latin _infero_, signifies what is brought in. _Deduction_, from Latin _deducere_, compounded of _de_, from, and _ducere_, lead, to bring out, signifies the bringing or drawing one conclusion from another.  
A _conclusion_ is full and decisive; an _inference_ is partial and indecisive: a _conclusion_ leaves the mind in no doubt or hesitation; it puts a stop to all further reasoning: _inferences_ are special _conclusions_ from particular circumstances; they serve as links in the chain of reasoning. _Conclusion_ in the technical sense is the concluding proposition of a syllogism, drawn from the two others, which are called the premises.  
_Conclusions_ are drawn from real facts; _inferences_ are drawn from the appearances of things; _deductions_ only from arguments or assertions. _Conclusions_ are practical, _inferences_ ratiocinative, _deductions_ are final. We _conclude_ from a person's conduct or declarations what he intends to do or leave undone; we _infer_ from the appearance of the clouds or the thickness of the atmosphere that there will be a heavy fall of rain or snow; we _deduce_, from a combination of facts, _inferences_, and assertions, that a story is fabricated. Hasty _conclusions_ betray a want of judgment or of firmness of mind: contrary _inferences_ are frequently drawn from the same circumstances to serve the purpose of party and support a favorite position; the _deductions_ in such cases are not unfrequently true when the _inferences_ are false.  
**CONCLUSIVE, DECISIVE, CONVINCING.** — _Conclusive_ applies either to practical or argumentative matters; _decisive_, to what is practical only; _convincing_, to what is argumentative only. It is necessary to be _conclusive_ when we deliberate, and _decisive_ when we command. What is _conclusive_ puts an end to all discussions and determines the judgment; what is _decisive_ puts an end to all wavering and determines the will. Negotiators have sometimes an interest in not speaking _conclusively;_ commanders can never retain their authority without speaking _decisively. Conclusive_, when compared to _convincing_, is general; the latter is particular: an argument is _convincing_, a chain of reasoning _conclusive._ There may be much that is _convincing_ where there is nothing _conclusive:_ a proof may be _convincing_ of a particular circumstance, but _conclusive_ evidence will bear upon the main question.

####concord 
**CONCORD, HARMONY.**  
_Concord_, in French _concorde_, Latin _concordia,_ is compounded from _con_, together, and _cors_, heart, having the same heart and mind. _Harmony_, in French _harmonie_, Latin _harmonia_, Greek _άρμονία_, from _αρμός_, a joining, signifies the state of fitting or suiting.  
The idea of union is common to both these terms, but under different circumstances. _Concord_ is generally employed for the union of wills and affections; _harmony_ respects the aptitude of minds to coalesce. There may be _concord_ without _harmony_, and _harmony_ without _concord._ Persons may live in _concord_ who are at a distance from one another; but _harmony_ is mostly employed for those who are in close connection and obliged to cooperate. _Concord_ should never be broken by relations under any circumstances; _harmony_ is indispensable in all members of a family that dwell together. Interest will sometimes stand in the way of brotherly _concord;_ a love of rule and a dogmatical temper will sometimes disturb the _harmony_ of a family.  
These terms are both applied to music, the one in a particular, the other in a general sense; there is _concord_ between two or more single sounds, and _harmony_ in any number or aggregate of sounds.  
_Harmony_ may be used in the sense of adaptation to things generally.

####condition 
**CONDITION, STATION.**  
_Condition_, in French _condition_, Latin _conditio_, from _con_, together, and _dicere_, to talk, signifies the agreement arrived at as a result of talking a matter over — something granted as a prerequisite to granting something else. _Station_, in French _station_, Latin _statio_, from _stare_, to stand, signifies a standing place or point.  
_Condition_ has most relation to circumstances, education, birth, and the like; _station_ refers rather to the rank, occupation, or mode of life which is marked out. Riches suddenly acquired are calculated to make a man forget his original _condition_ and to render him negligent of the duties of his _station._ The _condition_ of men in reality is often so different from what it appears that it is extremely difficult to form an estimate of what they are or what they have been. It is the folly of the present day that every man is unwilling to keep the _station_ which has been assigned to him by Providence: the rage for equality destroys every just distinction in society; the low aspire to be, in appearance at least, equal with their superiors; and those in elevated _stations_ do not hesitate to put themselves on a level with their inferiors.

####conduce 
**CONDUCE, CONTRIBUTE.**  
_Conduce_, Latin _conduco_, compounded of _con_ and _duco_, signifies to bring together for one end. _Contribute_, in Latin _contribuas_, participle of _contribuo_, compounded of _con_ and _tribuere_, to divide and assign, signifies to bestow for the same end.  
To _conduce_ signifies to serve the full purpose; to _contribute_ signifies only to serve a secondary purpose: the former is always taken in a good sense, the latter in a bad or good sense. Exercise _conduces_ to the health; it _contributes_ to give vigor to the frame. Nothing _conduces_ more to the well-being of any community than a spirit of subordination among all ranks and classes. A want of firmness and vigilance in the government or magistrates _contributes_ greatly to the spread of disaffection and rebellion. Schemes of ambition never _conduce_ to tranquillity of mind. A single failure may _contribute_ sometimes to involve a person in" perpetual trouble. 

####conduct 
**CONDUCT, MANAGE, DIRECT.**  
_Conduct_, in Latin _conductus_, participle of _conduco_, signifies to lead in some particular manner or for some special purpose. To _manage_ (see [care](entry://care); [charge](entry://charge)). To _direct_, in Latin _directus_, participle of _dirigo_, or _dis_, apart, and _regere_, to rule, signifies to regulate distinctly or put each in its right place.  
_Conducting_ requires most wisdom and knowledge; _managing_ most action; _direction_ most authority. A lawyer _conducts_ the cause intrusted to him; a steward _manages_ the mercantile concerns for his employer; a superintendent _directs_ the movements of all the subordinate agents. _Conducting_ is always applied to affairs of the first importance: _management_ is a term of familiar use to characterize a familiar employment: _direction_ makes up in authority what it wants in importance; it falls but little short of the word _conduct._ A _conductor_ conceives, plans, arranges, and disposes; a _manager_ acts or executes; a _director_ commands.  
It is necessary to _conduct_ with wisdom; to _manage_ with diligence, attention, and skill; to _direct_ with promptitude, precision, and clearness. A minister of state requires peculiar talents to _conduct_ with success the various and complicated concerns which are connected with his office; he must exercise much skill in _managing_ the various characters and clashing interests with which he becomes connected; and possess much influence to _direct_ the multiplied operations by which the grand machine of government is kept in motion. When a general undertakes to _conduct_ a campaign, he will intrust the _management_ of minor concerns to persons on whom he can rely; but he will _direct_ in person whatever is likely to have any serious influence on his success.

####confederate 
**CONFEDERATE, ACCOMPLICE.**  
_Confederate_ (see [ally](entry://ally)) and _accomplice_ (see [abettor](entry://abettor)) both imply a partner in some proceeding, but they differ as to the nature of the proceeding: in the former case it may be lawful or unlawful; in the latter unlawful only. In this latter sense a _confederate_ is a partner in a plot or secret association: an _accomplice_ is a partner in some active violation of the laws. Guy Fawkes retained his resolution, till the last extremity, not to reveal the names of his _confederates:_ it is the common refuge of all robbers and desperate characters to betray their _accomplices_ in order to screen themselves from punishment. 

####confer 
**CONFER, BESTOW.**  
_Confer_, in French _conférer_, Latin _confero_, compounded of _con_ and _fero_, signifies to ring something toward a person or place it upon him. _Bestow_ is compounded of _be_, a verbal prefix, and Anglo-Saxon _stow_, a place, and signifies to put in a place. _Conferring_ is an act of authority; _bestowing_ that of charity or generosity. Princes and men in power _confer;_ people in a private station _bestow._ Honors, dignities, privileges, and rank are the things _conferred;_ favors, kindnesses, and pecuniary relief are the things _bestowed._ Merit, favor, interest, caprice, or intrigue give rise to _conferring;_ necessity, solicitation, and private affection lead to _bestowing._  
In the moral application, what is _conferred_ or _bestowed_ is presumed to be deserved, but with the distinction that the one is gratuitous, the other involuntary.

####confide 
**CONFIDE, TRUST.**  
_Confide_, in Latin _confido_ (or _cum_, with, and _fidere_, to _trust)_, signifying to be united by trust with another, is to _trust_ (see [belief](entry://belief)) as the species to the genus: we always _trust_ when we _confide_, but not _vice versa. Confidence_ is an extraordinary _trust_, but _trust_ is always ordinary unless the term be otherwise qualified. _Confidence_ involves communication of a man's mind to another, but _trust_ is confined to matters of action.  
_Confidence_ may be sometimes limited in its application, as _confidence_ in the integrity or secrecy of a man; but _trust_ is in its signification limited to matters of personal interest. A breach of _trust_ evinces a want of that common principle which keeps human society together; but a breach of _confidence_ betrays a more than ordinary share of baseness and depravity.  
**CONFIDENT, DOGMATICAL, POSITIVE.** — _Confident_, from _confide_, marks the temper of _confiding_ in one's self. _Dogmatical_, from Greek _δόγμα_ (English _dogma)_, an opinion, signifies the temper of dealing in unqualified assertions. _Positive_, in Latin _positivus_, from _positus_, signifies fixed to a point.  
The first two of these words denote an habitual or permanent state of mind; the last either a partial or an habitual temper. There is much of _confidence_ in _dogmatism_ and _positivity_, but it expresses more than either. _Confidence_ implies a general reliance on one s abilities in whatever we undertake; _dogmatism_ implies a reliance on the truth of our opinions; _positivity_, a reliance on the truth of our assertions. A _confident_ man is always ready to act, as he is sure of succeeding; a _dogmatical_ man is always ready to speak, as he is sure of being heard; a _positive_ man is determined to maintain what he has asserted, as he is convinced that he has made no mistake. _Confidence_ is opposed to diffidence; _dogmatism_, to scepticism; _positivity_, to hesitation. A _confident_ man mostly fails for want of using the necessary means to insure success; a _dogmatical_ man is mostly in error, because he substitutes his own partial opinions for such as are established; a _positive_ man is mostly deceived, because he trusts more to his own senses and memory than he ought. Self-knowledge is the most effectual cure for _self-confidence;_ an acquaintance with men and things tends to lessen _dogmatism;_ the experience of one's self having been deceived, and the observation that others are perpetually liable to be deceived, ought to check the folly of being _positive_ as to any event or circumstance that is past. _Confidence_ is oftener expressed by actions than words; _dogmatism_ and _positivity_ always by words; the former denotes only the temper of the speaker, but the latter may influence the temper of others; a _positive_ assertion may not only denote the state of the person's mind who makes it, but also may serve to make another _positive._

####confinement 
**CONFINEMENT, IMPRISONMENT, CAPTIVITY.**  
_Confinement_ (see [bound](entry://bound)). _Imprisonment_, compounded of Latin _in_ and _prensionem_ (acc.), a seizure, French _prison_, from _pris_, participle of _prendre_, Latin _prehendere_, to take, signifies the act or state of being taken or laid hold of. _Captivity_, in French _captivité_, Latin _captivitas_, from _capere_, to take, signifies likewise the state of being, or being kept, in possession by another.  
_Confinement_ is the generic, the other two are specific terms. _Confinement_ and _imprisonment_ both imply the abridgment of one's personal freedom, but the former specifies no cause, which the latter does. We may be _confined_ in a room by ill health or _confined_ in any place by way of punishment; but we are never _imprisoned_ but in some specific place appointed for the _confinement_ of offenders, and always for some supposed offence. We are _captives_ by the rights of war when we fall into the hands of the enemy. _Confinement_ does not specify the degree or manner as the other terms do; it may even extend to the restricting the body of its free movements; while _imprisonment_ simply _confines_ the person within a certain extent of ground or the walls of a _prison;_ and _captivity_ leaves a person at liberty to range within a whole country or district.  
_Confinement_ is so general a term as to be applied to animals and even inanimate objects; _imprisonment_ and _captivity_ are applied in the proper sense to persons only, but they admit of a figurative application. Poor stray animals, which are found trespassing on unlawful ground, are doomed to a wretched _confinement_, rendered still more hard and intolerable by the want of food: the _confinement_ of plants within too narrow a space will stop their growth for want of air. There is many a poor _captive_ in a cage who, like Sterne's starling, would say, if it could, "I want to get out. " 

####confirm 
**CONFIRM, CORROBORATE.**  
To _confirm_, in Latin _confirme_, or _con_ and _fir-mare_, to make firm, signifies to make firm in a special manner. _Corroborate,_ from Latin _robur_, strength, whence our adjective _robust_ is derived, signifies to give additional strength.  
The idea of strengthening is common to these terms, but under different circumstances; _confirm_ is used generally, _corroborate_ only in particular instances. What _confirms_ serves to _confirm_ the mind; what _corroborates_ gives weight to the thing. An opinion or a story is _confirmed;_ an evidence or the representation of a person is _corroborated._ What _confirms_ removes all doubt; what _corroborates_ only gives more strength than the thing had before. When the truth of a thing is _confirmed_, nothing more is necessary: the testimony of a person may be so little credited that it may want much _corroboration._  
**CONFIRM, ESTABLISH.** — _Confirm_ (see above). _Establish_, from Latin _stabilis_, English _stable_, from _stare_, to stand, signifies to make stable, or able to stand.  
The idea of strengthening is common to these as to the former terms, but with a different application: to _confirm_ is applied to what is partial, if not temporary; to _establish_ to that which is permanent and of importance, as to _confirm_ a report, to _establish_ a reputation, to _confirm_ a treaty or alliance, to _establish_ a trade or government.  
So in respect to the mind and its operations: a belief, opinion, suspicion, or resolution is _confirmed;_ principles, faith, hopes, etc., are _established._

####conflict 
**CONFLICT, COMBAT, CONTEST.**  
_Conflict_, in Latin _conflictus_, participle of _confligo_, compounded of _con_ and _fligere_, to flip or strike, signifies to strike against each other. _Combat_ (see [battle](entry://battle)). _Contest_, in French _contester_, Latin _contestor_, compounded of _con_ and _tester_, from _testes_, a witness (compare English _testify)_, signifies to call or set witness against witness.  
A striving for the mastery is the common idea in the signification of these terms, which is varied in the manner and spirit of the action. A _conflict_, has more of violence in it than a _combat_, and a _combat_ than a _contest._ A _conflict_ supposes a violent collision, a meeting of force against force; a _combat_ supposes a contending together in fighting or battle. A _conflict_ may be the unpremeditated meeting of one or more persons in a violent or hostile manner; a _combat_ is frequently a concerted engagement between two or more particular individuals, as a sudden and violent _conflict_ ensued upon their corning up; they engaged in single _combat. Conflict_ is applied to whatever comes in violent collision, whether animate or inanimate, as the _conflicts_ of wild beasts or of the elements; _combat_ is applied to animals as well as men, particularly where there is a trial of skill or strength, as the _combats_ of the gladiators either with one another or with beasts; _contest_ is applied only to men.  
_Conflict_ and _contest_ are properly applied to moral objects, and _combat_ sometimes figuratively so, and all with a like distinction; violent passions produce _conflicts_ in the mind; there may be a _combat_ between reason and any particular passion; there may be a _contest_ for honors as well as posts of honor; reason will seldom come off victorious in the _combat_ with ambition. 

####conform 
See [comply](entry://comply)

####conformable 
**CONFORMABLE, AGREEABLE, SUITABLE.**  
_Conformable_ signifies able to _conform_ (see [comply](entry://comply)), that is, having a sameness of form. _Agreeable_ signifies the quality of being able to _agree. Suitable_ signifies able to _suit_ (see [agree](entry://agree)).  
_Conformable_ is employed for matters of obligation; _agreeable_, for matters of choice; _suitable_, for matters of propriety and discretion: what is _conformable_ accords with some prescribed form or given rule of others; what is _agreeable_ accords with the feelings, tempers, or judgments of ourselves or others; what is _suitable_ accords with outward circumstances: it is the business of those who act for others to act _conformably_ to their directions; it is the part of a friend to act _agreeably_ to the wishes of a friend; it is the part of every man to act _suitably_ to his station. The decisions of a judge must be strictly _conformable_ to the letter of the law; he is seldom at liberty to consult general views of equity: the decision of a partisan is always _agreeable_ to the temper of his party: the style of a writer should be _suitable_ to his subject.

####confound 
**CONFOUND, CONFUSE.**  
_Confound_ and _confuse_ are both derived from different parts of the same verb, namely, _confundo_, and its participle _confusus_, signifying to pour or mix together without design that which ought to be distinct.  
_Confound_ has an active sense; _confuse_ a neuter or reflective sense: a person _confounds_ one thing with another; objects become _confused_, or a person _confuses_ himself: it is a common error among ignorant people to _confound_ names, and among children to have their ideas _confused_ on commencing a new study. The present age is distinguished by nothing so much as by _confounding_ all distinctions, which is a great source of _confusion_ in men's intercourse with one another, both in public and private life.  
_Confuse_ is sometimes used transitively in the sense of causing _confusion_, as to _confuse_ an account; but in this case it is as much distinguished from _confound_ as in the other case. A person _confounds_ one account with the other when he takes them to be both the same; but he _confuses_ any particular account when he mingles different items under one head or brings the same item under different heads.

####confront 
**CONFRONT, FACE.**  
_Confront_, from the Latin _frons_, a forehead, implies to set _face_ to _face;_ and _face_, from Latin _facies_, English _face_, signifies to set the _face_ toward any object. The former of these terms is always employed for two or more persons with regard to one another; the latter for a single individual with regard to objects in general. Witnesses are _confronted;_ a person _faces_ danger, or _faces_ an enemy: when people give contrary evidence, it is sometimes necessary, in extra-judicial matters, to _confront_ them in order to arrive at the truth; the best evidence which a man can give of his courage is to evince his readiness for _facing_ his enemy whenever the occasion requires.

####confusion 
**CONFUSION, DISORDER.**  
_Confusion_ signifies the state of being _confounded_ or _confused_ (see [confound](entry://confound)). _Disorder_, compounded of _dis_, privative, and Latin _ordo_, English _order_, signifies the reverse of order.  
_Confusion_ is to _disorder_ as the species to the genus: _confusion_ supposes the absence of all order; _disorder_ the derangement of order where it exists, or is supposed to exist: there is always _disorder_ in _confusion_, but not always _confusion_ in _disorder._ The greater the multitude the more they are liable to fall into _confusion_ if they do not act in perfect concert, as in the case of a routed army or a tumultuous mob.  
Where there is the greatest order, the smallest circumstance is apt to produce _disorder_, the consequences of which will be more or less serious.  
See also [jumble](entry://jumble)

####confute 
**CONFUTE, REFUTE, DISPROVE, OPPUGN.**  
_Confute_ and _refute_, in Latin _confute_ and _refute_, are compounded of _con_, against, _re_ privative, and a verb stem _futa_, which is probably from the same root as Latin _fundere_, to pour out, overthrow, and is allied to English _futile_, Latin _futilis_, etc. _Disprove_, compounded of _dis_, privative, and _probare_, to prove, signifies to prove the contrary. _Oppugn_ comes from Latin _oppugnare_, to fight against.  
To _confute_ respects what is argumentative; _refute_, what is practical and personal; _disprove_, whatever is represented or related; _oppugn_, what is held or maintained. An argument is _confuted_ by proving its fallacy; a charge is _refuted_ by proving the innocence of the party charged; an assertion is _disproved_ by proving that it is incorrect; a doctrine is _oppugned_ by a course of reasoning. Paradoxes may be easily _refitted;_ calumnies may be easily _refuted;_ the marvellous and incredible stories of travellers may be easily _disproved;_ heresies and sceptical notions ought to be _oppugned._ The pernicious doctrines of sceptics, though often _confuted_, are as often advanced with the same degree of assurance by the free-thinking, and I might say the unthinking, few who imbibe their spirit: it is the employment of libellists to deal out their malicious aspersions against the objects of their malignity in a manner so loose and indirect as to preclude the possibility of _refutation:_ it would be a fruitless and unthankful task to attempt to _disprove_ all the statements which are circulated in a common newspaper. It is the duty of the ministers of the Gospel to _oppugn_ all doctrines that militate against the established faith of Christians.

####conjecture 
**CONJECTURE, SUPPOSITION, SURMISE.**  
_Conjecture_, in French _conjecture_, Latin _conjectura_, from _con_, together, and _jacere_, to throw, signifies the thing put together or framed in the mind without design or foundation. _Supposition_, in French _supposition_ from Latin _supponere_, compounded of _sub_, in place of, and _ponere_, to place, signifies to put one's thoughts in place of reality. _Surmise_ is compounded of Old French _sur_, Latin _super_, above, and _mettre_ (Latin _mittere)_, to put; it very nearly corresponds in its original meaning to the modern slang "put it over. "  
All these terms convey an idea of something in the mind independent of the reality; but _conjecture_ is founded less on rational inference than _supposition;_ and _surmise_ less than either: any circumstance, however trivial, may give rise to a _conjecture;_ some reasons are requisite to produce a _supposition;_ a particular state of feeling or train of thinking may of itself create a _surmise._ Although the same epithets are generally applicable to all these terms, yet we may with propriety say that a _conjecture_ is idle, a _supposition_ false, a _surmise_ fanciful. _Conjectures_ are employed on events, their causes, consequences, and contingencies: _supposition_, on speculative points; _surmise_, on personal concerns. The secret measures of government give rise to various _conjectures:_ all the _suppositions_ which are formed respecting comets seem at present to fall short of the truth: the behavior of a person will often occasion a _surmise_ respecting his intentions and proceedings, let them be ever so disguised. Antiquarians and etymologists deal much in _conjectures;_ they have ample scope afforded them for asserting what can be neither proved nor denied: religionists are pleased to build many _suppositions_ of a doctrinal nature on the Scriptures, or, more properly, on their own partial and forced interpretations of the Scriptures: it is the part of prudence, as well as justice, not to express any _surmises_ which we may entertain, either as to the character or conduct of others, which may not redound to their credit.

####conjuncture 
**CONJUNCTURE, CRISIS.**  
_Conjuncture_, in Latin _conjunctura_, from _con_, together, and _jungere_, to join, signifies the joining together of circumstances. _Crisis_, in Latin _crisis_, Greek _κρίσις_, from _κρίνειν_, to separate, signified a judgment founded upon analysis; hence simply a judgment, or anything which decides, or turns the scale.  
Both these terms are employed to express a period of time marked by the state of affairs. A _conjuncture_ is a joining or combination of corresponding circumstances tending toward the same end: a crisis is the high-wrought state of any affair which immediately precedes a change: a _conjuncture_ may be favorable, a crisis alarming. An able statesman seizes the _conjuncture_ which promises to suit his purpose, for the introduction of a favorite measure: the abilities, firmness, and perseverance of Alfred the Great, at one important _crisis_ of his reign, saved England from destruction. 

####conjure 
See [juggle](entry://juggle)

####connect 
**CONNECT, COMBINE, UNITE.**  
_Connect_, Latin _connecto_, compounded of _con_ and _necto_, signifies to knit together. _Combine_ (see **association** under [associate](entry://associate)). _Unite_ (see [add](entry://add)).  
The idea of being put together is common to these terms, but with different degrees of proximity. _Connected_ is more remote than _combined_, and this than _united._ What is _connected_ and _combined_ remains distinct, but what is _united_ loses all individuality. Things the most dissimilar may be _connected_ or _combined;_ things of the same kind only can be _united._ Things or persons are _connected_ more or less remotely by some common property or circumstance that serves as a tie; they are _combined_ by a species of juncture; they are _united_ by a coalition: houses are_ connected_ by means of a common passage; the armies of two nations are _combined;_ two armies of the same nation are _united._ Trade, marriage, or general intercourse create a _connection_ between individuals; co-operation and similarity of tendency are grounds for _combination;_ entire accordance leads to a _union._ It is dangerous to be _connected_ with the wicked in any way; our reputation, if not our morals, must be the sufferers thereby. The most obnoxious members of society are those in whom wealth, talents, influence, and a lawless ambition are _combined. United_ is an epithet that should apply to nations and families; the same obedience to laws should regulate every man who lives under the same government; the same heart should animate every breast; the same spirit should dictate every action of every member in the community who has a common interest in the preservation of the whole.  
**CONNECTION, RELATION.** — _Connection_ (see above). _Relation_, from _relate_, in Latin _relatus_, participle of _refero_, to bring back, signifies carrying back to some point.  
These words are applied to two or more things to denote the manner in which they stand in regard to one another. A _connection_ denotes that which binds two objects, or the situation of being so bound by some tie; but _relation_ denotes the situation of two or more objects in regard to one another yet without defining what it is; a _connection_ is therefore a species of _relation_, but a _relation_ may be something which does not amount to a _connection._ Families are _connected_ with each other by the ties of blood or marriage; per sons are _connected_ with each other in the way of trade or business; objects stand in a certain _relation_ to each other, as persons stand in the _relation_ of giver and receiver, or of debtor and creditor; there is a _connection_ between Church and State, or between morality and religion; men stand in the _relation_ of creatures to their Creator.  
The word _relation_ is sometimes taken in a limited sense for one _connected_ by family ties, which denotes something nearer in that case than _connection;_ as when speaking of a man's _relations._ or of a person being _related_ to another, or to leave one's property to one's _relations._

**CONQUER, VANQUISH, SUBDUE, OVERCOME, SURMOUNT.**  
_Conquer_, in French _conquérir_, Latin _conquiro_, compounded of _con_ and _quœrere_, to search after diligently, signifies in an extended sense to obtain by searching. _Vanquish_ is in French _vaincre_, Latin _vincere. Subdue_, Latin _subdere_, signifies to give or put under. _Overcome_ signifies to come over or get the mastery over one. _Surmount_, in French _surmonter_, compounded of _sur_ (Latin _super)_, above, and _monter_ (from Latin _montem_, hill), to climb a hill, or simply to climb, signifies to rise above any one. The leading idea in the word _conquer_ is that of getting; the leading idea in _vanquish_ and _subdue_ is that of getting the better of, the former partially, the latter thoroughly, so as to prevent any future resistance: a country is _conquered;_ an enemy is _vanquished;_ in the field of battle a people is _subdued. Conquer_ may sometimes also signify to get the better of, but in that case it does not define the mode or extent of the action; we may _conquer_ another in any contest and in any manner; but we _vanquish_ and _subdue_ persons only by force, and mostly by force of arms.  
When _overcome_ is applied to persons it has precisely the same indefinite and general meaning as _conquer._  
But _overcome_, as well as _conquer, subdue_, and _vanquish_, are applied also to moral objects, and _surmount_ has for the most part no other application. To _conquer_ is said of the person himself, his likes, dislikes, and feelings generally; _subdue_ of what relates either to the person himself or some other person, as to _subdue_ the will or the passions. What is _conquered_ makes less resistance and requires less force than what is _subdued._ It is likewise not so thoroughly subjugated or destroyed. We may _conquer_ an aversion at one time which may return at another time; if the will be _subdued_ in childhood, it will not prevail in riper years.  
To _vanquish_ is applied figuratively to particular objects as in the proper sense.  
To _overcome_ is applied to objections, •scruples, prejudices, difficulties, and the like; _surmount_, to difficulties, obstacles, impediments, etc. What is _overcome_ requires less exertion than that which is _surmounted._ We may _overcome_ by patience or forbearance; but determination, or the application of more or less force, is necessary in _surmounting_ obstacles.  
**CONQUEROR, VICTOR.** — These terms, though derived from the preceding verbs, have, notwithstanding, characteristics peculiar to themselves. A _conqueror_ is always supposed to add something to his possessions; a _victor_ gains nothing but the superiority: there is no _conquest_ where there is not something gotten; there is no _victory_ where there is no contest: all _conquerors_ are not _victors_, nor all _victors conquerors:_ those who take possession of other men's lands by force of arms make a _conquest;_ those who excel in any trial of skill are the _victors._ Monarchs when they wage a successful war are mostly _conquerors;_ combatants who compel their adversaries to yield are _victors._

####conscientious 
**CONSCIENTIOUS, SCRUPULOUS.**  
_Conscientious_, ultimately from Latin _con_, intensive prefix, and _scire_, to know, signifies the possession of moral intelligence, the perception of right and wrong. _Scrupulous_, from _scruple_, signifies the quality of having scruples. _Scruple_, in Latin _scrupulus_, signifies a little hard stone, which in walking gives pain.  
_Conscientious_ is to _scrupulous_ as a whole to a part. A _conscientious_ man is so altogether; a _scrupulous_ man may have only particular _scruples:_ the one is therefore always taken in a good sense; and the other at least in an indifferent, if not a bad sense. A _conscientious_ man does nothing to offend his _conscience;_ but a _scrupulous_ man has often his _scruples_ on trifling or minor points; the Pharisees were _scrupulous_ without being _conscientious:_ we must therefore strive to be _conscientious_ without being over-_scrupulous._

####consent 
**CONSENT, PERMIT, ALLOW.**  
_Consent_ (see [agree](entry://agree)). _Permit_ and _allow_ (see [admit](entry://admit)).  
The idea of determining the conduct of others by some authorized act of one's own is common to these terms, but under various circumstances. They express either the act of an equal or a superior. As the act of an equal we _consent_ to that in which we have a common interest with others: we _permit_ or _allow_ what is for the accommodation of others: we _allow_ by abstaining to oppose; we _permit_ by a direct expression of our will; contracts are formed by the _consent_ of the parties who are interested. The proprietor of an estate _permits_ his friends to sport on his grounds; he _allows_ of a passage through his premises. It is sometimes prudent to _consent_, complaisant to _permit_, good-natured or weak to _allow. Consent_ respects matters of serious importance; _permit_ and _allow_ regard those of an indifferent nature: a parent _consents_ to the establishment of his children; he _permits_ them to read certain books; he _allows_ them to converse with him familiarly. We must pause before we give our _consent;_ it is an express sanction to the conduct of others; it involves our own judgment and the future interests of those who are under our control. This is not always so necessary in _permitting_ and _allowing;_ they are partial actions, which require no more than the bare exercise of authority, and involve no other consequence than the temporary pleasure of the parties concerned. Public measures are _permitted_ and _allowed_, but never _consented_ to. The law _permits_ or _allows;_ or the person who is authorized _permits_ or _allows. Permit_ in this case retains its positive sense; _allow_, its negative sense, as before. Government _permits_ individuals to fit out privateers in time of war: when magistrates are not vigilant, many things will be done which are not _allowed._ A judge is not _permitted_ to pass any sentence but what is strictly conformable to law: every man who is accused is _allowed_ to plead his own cause, or intrust it to another, as he thinks fit.  
These terms are similarly distinguished in the moral application.

####consequence 
**CONSEQUENCE, EFFECT, RESULT, ISSUE, EVENT.**  
_Consequence_, in French. _conséquence_, Latin _consequentia_, from _consequor_, follow, signifies that which follows in connection with something else. _Effect_ is the thing effected (see **accomplished** under [accomplish](entry://accomplish)). _Result_, in French _résulte_, Latin _resulto_, or _resultus_ and _resilire_, to rebound, signifies that which springs or bounds back from another thing. _Issue_ is that which issues or flows out (see [arise](entry://arise)). _Event_, in Latin _eventus_, participle of _evenio_, from _e_, forth, and _venire_, to come, is that which comes forth.  
All these terms are employed to denote that which follows something else; they vary according to the different circumstances under which they follow, or the manner of their following. A _consequence_ is that which follows of itself, without any qualification or restriction; an _effect_ is that which is effected or produced, or which follows from the connection between the thing effecting, as a cause, and the thing effected. In the nature of things causes will have _effects_, and for every _effect_ there will be a cause, although it may not be visible. _Consequences_, on the other hand, are either casual or natural; they are not always to be calculated upon. _Effect_ applies to physical or moral objects; _consequences_ to moral objects only: diseases are the _effects_ of intemperance; the loss of character is the general _consequence_ of an irregular life.  
_Consequences_ follow either from the actions of men or from things where there is no direct agency or design; _results_ follow from the actions or efforts of men: _consequences_ are good or bad; _results_ are favorable or unfavorable. We endeavor to avert _consequences_ and to produce _results._ Not to foresee the _consequences_ which are foreseen by others evinces a more than ordinary share of indiscretion and infatuation. To calculate on a favorable _result_ from an ill-judged or ill-executed enterprise only proves a consistent blindness in the projector.  
A _consequence_ may be particular or follow from a part; a _result_ is general, following from a whole: there may be many _consequences_ from the same thing, and but one _result_ only. As _results_ follow from actions or _efforts_, there is this further distinction; that in regard to intellectual operations _results_ may be drawn by the act of the mind, as the _results_ of reasoning or calculation.  
_Consequences_ may be intermediate or final; _issue_ and _event_ are always final: the former is that which flows from particular efforts; the latter from complicated undertakings where chance may interpose to bring about that which happens; hence we speak of the _issue_ of a negotiation or a battle, and the _event_ of a war. The fate of a nation sometimes hangs on the _issue_ of a battle. The measures of government are often unjustly praised or blamed according to the _event._

####consider 
**CONSIDER, REFLECT.**  
_Consider_ is derived from Latin _con_, together, and _sidus_, star, signifying to contemplate the stars, then simply to contemplate or think. _Reflect_, in Latin _reflecto_, compounded of _re_ and _flecto_, bend, signifies to turn back or upon itself.  
The operation of thought is expressed by these two words, but it varies in the circumstances of the action. _Consideration_ is employed for practical purposes; _reflection_ for matters of speculation or moral improvement. Common objects call for _consideration;_ the workings of the mind itself, or objects purely spiritual, occupy _reflection._ It is necessary to _consider_ what is proper to be done before we take any step; it is consistent with our natures, as rational beings, to _reflect_ on what we are, what we ought to be, and what we shall be. Without _consideration_ we shall naturally commit the most flagrant errors; without _reflection_ we shall never understand our duty to our Maker, our neighbor, and ourselves.  
**CONSIDER, REGARD.** — To _consider_ signifies to take a view of a thing in the mind which is the result of thought. To _regard_ (see [care](entry://care)) is properly to look back upon or to look at with concern. There is more caution or thought in _considering_, more personal interest in _regarding._ To _consider_ is to bear in mind all that prudence or propriety suggests; to _regard_ is to bear in mind all that our wishes or interests suggest. It is most usual to _consider_ the means or matters in detail, and to _regard_ the end or object at large: a man will _consider_ whether a thing is good or bad, proper or improper, out of the _regard_ which he has for his reputation, his honor, his conscience, and the like. Where he has no _consideration_ he cannot possibly have a _regard_, but he may have a _regard_ where _considerations_ are not necessary. A want of _consideration_ as to the circumstances and capacity of another may lead one to form a wrong judgment of his conduct. A want of _regard_ for the person himself may lead one to be regardless of his comfort and convenience.  
So, in application to things not expressly connected with one's interests or inclinations, to _consider_ is to look at things simply as they are; to _regard_ is to look at them with a certain degree of interest.  
**CONSIDERATION, REASON.** — _Consideration_, or that which enters into a person's _consideration_, has a reference to the person considering. _Reason_ (see [cause](entry://cause)), or that which influences the reason, is taken absolutely. _Considerations_ are therefore, for the most part, partial, as affecting particular interests, or dependent on particular circumstances. _Reasons_, on the contrary, may be general, and vary according to the subject.  
The _consideration_ influences particular actions; the _reason_ determines a line of conduct: no _consideration_ of profits should induce a person to forfeit his word; the _reasons_ which men assign for their conduct are often as absurd as they are false.  
In matters of argument, the _consideration_ is that which one offers to the _consideration_ of another; the _reason_ is that which lies in the nature of the thing. 

####consign 
**CONSIGN, COMMIT, INTRUST.**  
_Consign_, in French _consigner_, Latin _consigne_, compounded of _con_ and _signare_, to seal, signifies to seal for a specific purpose, also to deposit. _Commit_, in French _commettre_, Latin _committo_, compounded of _con_, together, and _mittere_, to send or put, signifies to put into a person's hands. _Intrust_ signifies to put in trust.  
The idea of transferring from one's self to the care of another is common to these terms, differing in the nature and object of the action. To _consign_ is a more formal act, a more absolute giving from ourselves to another, than to _commit:_ a merchant _consigns_ his goods to another to dispose of them for his advantage; he _commits_ the management of his business to his clerk: a child is _consigned_ to another, for him to take the whole charge of his education, maintenance, and the like; but when he is _committed_ to the charge of another, it is mostly with limitations.  
To _intrust_ refers to the degree of trust or confidence which is reposed in the individual; a child may be _intrusted_ to the care of a servant for a short time; a person may be _intrusted_ with the property or secrets of another; or individuals may be _intrusted_ with power.  
In the figurative application, to _consign_ is to deliver over so as to become the property of another thing; to _commit_ is to give over for the purpose of taking charge of. Death _consigns_ many to an untimely grave; a writer _commits_ his thoughts to the press.  
_Consign_ may thus be used in the sense of assign, and _commit_ in the sense of trusting at all hazards. 

####consistent 
See [compatible](entry://compatible); [consonant](entry://consonant)

####console 
**CONSOLE, SOLACE, COMFORT.**  
_Console_ and _solace_ are derived from the same source, in French _consoler_, Latin _consolari_, to comfort. _Comfort_ (see [comfort](entry://comfort)).  
_Console_ and _solace_ denote the relieving of pain; _comfort_ marks the communication of positive pleasure. We _console_ others with words; we _console_ or _solace_ ourselves with reflections; we _comfort_ by words or deeds. _Console_ is used on more important occasions than _solace._ We _console_ our friends when they meet with afflictions; we _solace_ ourselves when we meet with disasters; we _comfort_ those who stand in need of comfort. The greatest _consolation_ which we can enjoy on the death of our friends is derived from the hope that they have exchanged a state of imperfection and sorrow for one that is full of pure and unmixed felicity. It is no small _solace_ to us, in the midst of all our troubles, to consider that they are not so bad that they might not have been worse. The _comforts_ which a person enjoys may be considerably enhanced by the comparison with what he has formerly suffered. 

####consonant 
**CONSONANT, ACCORDANT, CONSISTENT.**  
_Consonant_, from the Latin _consonans_, participle of _con_, together, and _sonare_, to sound, signifies to sound, or be, in unison or harmony. _Accordant_, from _accord_, signifies the quality of according (for derivation see _accord_ under the key-word AGREE). _Consistent_, from the Latin _consistens_, participle of _consista_, from _con_, together, and _sistere_, to place, signifies the quality of being able to stand in unison together.  
_Consonant_ is employed in matters of representation; _accordant_, in matters of opinion or sentiment; _consistent_, in matters of conduct. A particular passage is _consonant_ with the whole tenor of the Scriptures; a particular account is _accordant_ with all one hears and sees on a subject; a person's conduct is not always _consistent_ with his station. _Consonant_ is opposed to dissonant; _accordant_, to discordant; _consistent_, to inconsistent. _Consonance_ is not so positive a thing as either _accordance_ or _consistency_, which respects real events, circumstances, and actions. _Consonance_ may serve to prove the truth of a thing, but _dissonance_ does not prove its falsehood until it amounts to direct _discordance_ or _inconsistency._ There is a _dissonance_ in the accounts given by the four Evangelists of our Saviour, which serves to prove the absence of all collusion and imposture, since there is neither _discordance_ nor _inconsistency_ in what they have related or omitted.

####constancy 
**CONSTANCY, STABILITY, STEADINESS, FIRMNESS.**  
_Constancy_, in French _constance_, Latin _constantia_, from _constans_ and _consto_, compounded of _con_ and _stare_, to stand by or close to a thing, signifies the quality of adhering to the thing that has been once chosen. _Stability_, in French _stabilité_, Latin _stabilitas_, from _stabilis_ and _stare_, to stand, signifies the quality of being able to stand. _Steadiness_, the quality of being _steady_, is derived from Anglo-Saxon _stede_, a place, found in words like _homestead, instead_, etc. _Steady_ signifies standing in one place. _Firm_ comes from Latin _firmus_, unmoved.  
_Constancy_ respects the affections; _stability_, the opinions; _steadiness_, the action or the motives of action; _firmness_, the purpose or resolution. _Constancy_ prevents from changing, and furnishes the mind with resources against weariness or disgust of the same object; it preserves and supports an attachment under every change of circumstances; _stability_ prevents from varying; it bears up the mind against the movements of levity or curiosity, which a diversity of objects might produce; _steadiness_ prevents from deviating; it enables the mind to bear up against the influence of humor, which temperament or outward circumstances might produce; it fixes on one course, and keeps to it: _firmness_ prevents from yielding; it gives the mind strength against all the attacks to which it may be exposed; it makes a resistance, and comes off triumphant. _Constancy_ among lovers and friends is the favorite theme of poets; the word has, however, afforded but few originals from which they could copy their pictures: they have mostly described what is desirable rather than what is real. _Stability_ of character is essential for those who are to command, for how can they govern others who cannot govern their own thoughts? _Steadiness_ of deportment is a great recommendation to those who have to obey: how can any one perform his part well who suffers himself to be perpetually interrupted? _Firmness_ of character is indispensable in the support of principles: there are many occasions in which this part of a man's character is likely to be put to a severe test. _Constancy_ is opposed to fickleness; _stability_, to changeableness; _steadiness_, to flightiness; _firmness_, to pliancy.

####constitute 
**CONSTITUTE, APPOINT, DEPUTE.**  
_Constitute_, in Latin _constitutus_, participle of _constitute_, that is, _con_, together, and _statuo_, place, signifies here to put or place for a specific purpose. _Appoint_ (see [appoint](entry://appoint)). _Depute_, in French _députer_, Latin _deputo_, compounded of _de_, from, and _putare_, to esteem or assign, signifies to assign a certain office to a person.  
The act of choosing some person or persons for an office is comprehended under all these terms: _constitute_ is a more solemn act than _appoint_, and this than _depute:_ to _constitute_ is the act of a body; to _appoint_ and _depute_, either of a body or an individual: a community _constitutes_ any one their leader; a monarch _appoints_ his ministers; an assembly _deputes_ some of its members. To _constitute_ implies the act of making as well as choosing; the office as well as the person is new: in _appointing_, the person, but not the office, is new. A person may be _constituted_ arbiter or judge as circumstances may require; a successor is _appointed_, but not _constituted._  
Whoever is _constituted_ is invested with supreme authority derived from the highest sources of power; whoever is _appointed_ derives his authority from the authority of others, and has consequently but limited power: no individual can _appoint_ another with authority equal to his own: whoever is _deputed_ has private and not public authority; his office is partial, often confined to the particular transaction of an individual, or a body of individuals. According to the Romish religion, the Pope is _constituted_ supreme head of the Christian Church throughout the whole world; governors are _appointed_ to distant provinces; persons are _deputed_ to present petitions or make representations to government.

####constraint 
**CONSTRAINT, COMPULSION.**  
_Constraint_, from _constrain_, Latin _constringo_, compounded of _con_, together, and _stringere_, to draw tight, signifies the act of straining or tying together. _Compulsion_ signifies the act of compelling. (See [compel](entry://compel))  
There is much of bindings__ in _constraint;_ of violence in _compulsion: constraint_ prevents from acting agreeably to the will; _compulsion_ forces to act contrary to the will: a soldier in the ranks moves with much _constraint_, and is often subject to much _compulsion_ to make him move as is desired. _Constraint_ may arise from outward circumstances; _compulsion_ is always produced by some active agent: the forms of civil society lay a proper _constraint_ upon the behavior of men, so as to render them agreeable to one another; the arm of the civil power must ever be ready to _compel_ those who will not submit without _compulsion:_ in the moments of relaxation, the actions of children should be as free from _constraint_ as possible; those who know and wish to do what is right will always be ready to discharge their duty without _compulsion._  
**CONSTRAINT, RESTRAINT.** — _Constraint_ (see above). _Restraint_ (see [coerce](entry://coerce)).  
_Constraint_ respects the movements of the body only; _restraint_, those of the mind and the outward actions: when they both refer to the outward actions, we say a person's behavior is _constrained;_ his feelings are _restrained:_ he is _constrained_ to act or not to act, or to act in a certain manner; he is _restrained_ from acting at all, or he may be _restrained_ from feeling: the conduct is _constrained_ by certain prescribed rules, by discipline and order; it is _restrained_ by particular motives: whoever learns a mechanical exercise is _constrained_ to move his body in a certain direction; the fear of detection often _restrains_ persons from the commission of vices more than any sense of their enormity. 

####construct 
See [build](entry://build)

####consult 
**CONSULT, DELIBERATE.**  
_Consult_, in French _consulter_, Latin _consulto_, is a frequentative of _consulo_, signifying to counsel together (see [advice](entry://advice)). The root of _consulo_ is uncertain; it may be allied to _sedere_, to sit. _Deliberate_, in French _délibérer._ Latin _delibero_, compounded of _de_ and _libra_, a balance, signifies to weigh as in a balance.  
_Consultations_ always require two persons at least; _deliberations_ may be carried on either with a man's self or with numbers: an individual may _consult_ with one or many; assemblies commonly _deliberate:_ advice and information are given and received in _consultations;_ doubts, difficulties, and objections are started and removed in _deliberations._ We communicate and hear when we _consult;_ we pause and hesitate when we _deliberate:_ those who have to co-operate must frequently _consult_ together; those who have serious measures to decide upon must coolly _deliberate._

####consume 
See [destroy](entry://destroy)

####consummation 
**CONSUMMATION, COMPLETION.**  
_Consummation_, Latin _consummatio_, compounded of _con_, together, and _summa_, the top, the sum, from _supmus_ (superlative of words whose comparative is _super_, above), signifying the very top, means the summing or winding up of the whole — the putting a final period to any concern. _Completion_, signifies either the act of completing or the state of being completed (see [complete](entry://complete)).  
The arrival at a conclusion is comprehended in both these terms, but they differ principally in application; wishes are _consummated;_ plans are _completed:_ we often flatter ourselves that the _completion_ of all our plans will be the _consummation_ of all our wishes, and thus expose ourselves to grievous disappointments  
As epithets, _consummate_ and _complete_ admit of a similar distinction. _Consummate_ is said of that which rises absolutely to the highest possible degree, as _consummate_ wisdom, or _consummate_ felicity: _complete_ is said of that which is so relatively; a thing may be _complete_ which fully answers the purpose. 

####consumption 
See [decay](entry://decay)

####contact 
**CONTACT, TOUCH.**  
_Contact_, in Latin _contactus_, participle of _contingo_, compounded of _con_ and _tangere_, to touch together, is distinguished from the simple word _touch_ (derived through French _toucher_ from a Teutonic root allied with Anglo-Saxon _teon_, to pull or draw, and Latin _ducere_, to lead), not so much in sense as in grammatical construction; the former expressing a state, and referring to two bodies actually in that state; the latter, on the other hand, implying the abstract act of _touching:_ we speak of things coming or being in _contact_, but not of the _contact_ instead of the _touch_ of a thing: the poison which comes from the poison-tree is so powerful in its nature that it is not necessary to come in _contact_ with it in order to feel its baneful influence; some insects are armed with stings so inconceivably sharp that the smallest _touch_ possible is sufficient to produce a puncture in the flesh. 

####contagion 
**CONTAGION, INFECTION.**  
Both these terms imply the power of communicating something bad, but _contagion_, from the Latin _con_, and _tag_, from _tango_, to come in contact, proceeds from a simple touch; and _infection_, from the Latin _inficio_, or _in_, in, and _facere_, to make, proceeds by receiving something inwardly or having it infused. We consider _contagion_ as to the manner of spreading from one body to another; we consider _infection_ as to the act of its working itself into the system. Whatever acts by _contagion_ acts immediately by direct personal contact; whatever acts by _infection_ acts gradually and indirectly, or through the medium of a third body, as clothes, or the air when _infected._ The word _contagion_ is, therefore, properly applied only to particular diseases, but _infection_ may be applied to every disease which is communicable from one subject to another. Whatever, therefore, is _contagious_ is also _infectious_, but not _vice versa._  
So, in application to other things besides diseases, _contagion_ is employed to denote that species of communication which is effected by a direct action on the senses.  
_Infection_ is employed to denote the communication which takes place by the gradual process of being _infected_ with anything.  
So, in the moral application, whatever is outward acts by _contagion_, as to shun the _contagion_ of bad example or bad manners. Whatever acts inwardly acts by _infection_, as to shun the _infection_ of bad principles.  
**CONTAGIOUS, EPIDEMICAL, PESTILENTIAL.** — _Contagious_ signifies having or causing _contagion. Epidemical_, in Latin _epidemicus_ (Greek _έπίδημος_, that is, _έπί_ and _δημος_, among the people), signifies universally spread. _Pestilential_, from the Latin _pestis_, the plague, signifies having the plague, or a similar disorder.  
The _contagious_ applies to that which is capable of being caught, and ought not, therefore, to be touched; the _epidemical_, to that which is already caught or circulated, and requires, therefore, to be stopped; the _pestilential_, to that which may breed an evil, and is, therefore, to be removed: diseases are _contagious_ or _epidemical;_ the air or breath is _pestilential._ They may all be applied morally or figuratively in the same sense. We endeavor to shun a _contagious_ disorder, that it may not come near us; we endeavor to purify a _pestilential_ air, that it may not be inhaled to our injury; we endeavor to provide against _epidemical_ disorders, that they may not spread any farther. Vicious example is _contagious;_ certain follies or vices of fashion are _epidemical_ in almost every age; the breath of infidelity is _pestilential._

####contain 
**CONTAIN, HOLD.**  
_Contain_ (see [comprise](entry://comprise)). _Hold_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _healdan_, which appears in some form in most of the Teutonic languages with the significance that it now has in English.  
These terms agree in sense, but differ in application; the former is by comparison noble, the latter is ignoble in its use: _hold_ is employed only for the material contents of hollow bodies; _contain_ is employed for moral or spiritual contents: in familiar discourse a cask is said to _hold_, but in more polished language it is said to _contain_ a certain number of gallons. A coach _holds_ or _contains_ a given number of persons; a room _holds_ a given quantity of furniture; a house or city _contains_ its inhabitants. 

####contaminate 
**CONTAMINATE, DEFILE, POLLUTE, TAINT, CORRUPT.**  
_Contaminate_ has the same derivation as _contagion;_ it comes from Latin _contaminare_, from the prefix _con_, together, and the root _tag_, touch. _Defile_ is compounded of Latin _de_, from, and Anglo-Saxon _fylan_, to make foul, from _ful_, Modern English _foul. Pollute_ is derived from Latin _pol_, allied to Old Latin _por_, toward, and _luere_, to wash, allied to _lave_, and meant originally to wash over, like a flooded river. _Taint_, in French _teint_, participle of _teindre_, in Latin _tingere_, to dye or stain. _Corrupt_ in Latin _corruptus_, participle of _corrumpo_, compounded of _con_, together, and _rumpere_, to break, signifies to break to pieces.  
_Contaminate_ is not so strong an expression as _defile_ or _pollute;_ but it is stronger than _taint:_ these terms are used in the sense of injuring purity: _corrupt_ has the idea of destroying it. Whatever is impure _contaminates;_ what is gross and vile in the natural sense _defiles_, and in the moral sense _pollutes;_ what is contagious or infectious _corrupts;_ and what is _corrupted_ may _taint_ other things. Improper conversation or reading _contaminates_ the mind of youth; lewdness and obscenity _defile_ the body and _pollute_ the mind; loose company _corrupts_ the morals; the coming in contact with a _corrupted_ body is sufficient to give a _taint._ If young people be admitted to a promiscuous intercourse with society, they must unavoidably witness objects that are calculated to _contaminate_ their thoughts, if not their inclinations. They are thrown in the way of seeing the hps of females _defiled_ with the grossest indecencies, and hearing or seeing things which cannot be heard or seen without _polluting_ the soul: it cannot be surprising if after this their principles are found to be _corrupted_ before they have reached the age of maturity. 

####contemn 
**CONTEMN, DESPISE, SCORN, DISDAIN.**  
_Contemn_ comes from Latin _contemnere_, compounded of _con_, intensive prefix, and _temnere_, to despise. _Despise_, in Latin _despicio_, compounded of _de_, from, and _specere_, to look, signifies to look down upon, which is a strong mark of _contempt. Scorn_, from Old French _escorner_, meant originally to deprive of horns (Latin _ex_, from, and _cornu_, horn), hence to humiliate or dishonor. It has been influenced by the Old High German _scernon_, to deride. _Disdain_ is compounded of _dis_, privative, and Old French _degnier_, from Latin _dignare_, to think worthy; accordingly it means to think unworthy.  
The above elucidations sufficiently evince the feeling toward others which gives birth to all these actions. But the feeling of _contempt_ is not quite so strong as that of _despising_, nor that of_ despising_ so strong as those of _scorning_ and _disdaining_, the latter of which expresses the strongest sentiment of all. Persons are _contemned_ for their moral qualities; they are _despised_ on account of their outward circumstances, their characters, or their endowments. Superiors may be _contemned;_ inferiors only, or those who degrade themselves, are _despised. Contempt_, as applied to persons, is not incompatible with a Christian temper when justly provoked by their character; but _despising_ is distinctly forbidden and seldom warranted. Yet it is not so much our business to _contemn_ others as to _contemn_ that which is _contemptible;_ but we are not equally at liberty to _despise_ the person, or anything belonging to the person, of another. Whatever springs from the free-will of another may be a subject of _contempt_, but the casualties of fortune or the gifts of Providence, which are alike independent of personal merit, should never expose a person to be _despised._ We may, however, _contemn_ a person for his impotent malice, or _despise_ him for his meanness.  
Persons are not _scorned_ or _disdained_, but they may be treated with _scorn_ or _disdain;_ they are both improper expressions of _contempt_ or _despite: scorn_ marks the sentiment of a little, vain mind: _disdain_ of a haughty and perverted one. A beautiful woman looks with _scorn_ on her whom she _despises_ for the want of this natural gift. The wealthy man treats with _disdain_ him whom he _despises_ for his poverty.  
In speaking of things independently of others, or as immediately connected with ourselves, all these terms may be sometimes employed in a good or an indifferent sense. When we _contemn_ a mean action, and _scorn_ to conceal by falsehood what we are called upon to acknowledge, we act the part of the gentleman as well as the Christian; but it is inconsistent with our infirm and dependent condition that we should feel inclined to _despise_ anything that falls in our way; much less are we at liberty to _disdain_ to do anything which our station requires; we ought to think nothing unworthy of us, nothing degrading to us, but that which is inconsistent with the will of God: there are, however, too many who affect to _despise_ small favors as not reaching their fancied deserts, and others who _disdain_ to receive any favors at all, from mistaken notions about dependence and obligation. 

####contemplate 
**CONTEMPLATE, MEDITATE, MUSE.**  
_Contemplate_, from Latin _contemplari_, was used at first of the observations and meditations of the augurs, and was derived from _templum_, English _temple_, the consecrated place open to the sky, where the augurs made their observations. _Meditate_, in Latin _meditatus_, participle of _meditor_, from Greek _μέδομαι_, I attend to, meant to devote the thoughts to something. For the derivation of _muse_ see [amuse](entry://amuse).  
Different species of reflection are marked by these terms. We _contemplate_ what is present or before our eyes; we _meditate_ on what is past or absent. The heavens and all the works of the Creator are objects of _contemplation;_ the ways of Providence are fit subjects for _meditation._ One _muses_ on events or circumstances which have been just passing.  
We may _contemplate_ and _meditate_ for the future, but never _muse._ In this case the two former terms have the sense of contriving or purposing: what is _contemplated_ to be done is thought of more indistinctly than when it is _meditated_ to be done: many things are bad in _contemplation_ which are never seriously _meditated_ upon: between _contemplating_ and _meditating_ there is oftener a greater distance than between _meditating_ and executing.  
_Meditating_ is a permanent and serious action; _musing_ is partial and unimportant: _meditation_ is a religious duty, it cannot be neglected without injury to a person's spiritual improvement; _musing_ is a temporary employment of the mind on the ordinary concerns of life, as they happen to excite an interest for the time. _Contemplative_ and _musing_, as epithets, have a strong analogy to each other. _Contemplative_ is a habit of the mind; _musing_ is a particular state of the mind. A person may have a _contemplative_ turn, or be in a _musing_ mood.

####contemptible 
**CONTEMPTIBLE, CONTEMPTUOUS.**  
These terms are very frequently, though very erroneously, confounded in common discourse. _Contemptible_ is applied to the thing deserving _contempt; contemptuous_, to that which is expressive of _contempt._ Persons, or what is done by persons, may be either _contemptible_ or _contemptuous._ A production is _contemptible;_ a sneer or look is _contemptuous._  
**CONTEMPTIBLE, DESPICABLE, PITIFUL.** — _Contemptible_ is not so strong as _despicable_ or _pitiful._ A person may be _contemptible_ for his vanity or weakness; but he is _despicable_ for his servility and baseness of character; he is _pitiful_ for his want of manliness and becoming spirit. A lie is at all times _contemptible;_ it is _despicable_ when it is told for purposes of gain or private interest; it is _pitiful_ when accompanied with indications of unmanly fear. It is _contemptible_ to take credit to one's self for the good action one had not performed; it is _despicable_ to charge another with the faults which we ourselves have committed; it is _pitiful_ to offend others, and then attempt to screen ourselves from their resentment under any shelter which offers. It is _contemptible_ for a man in a superior station to borrow of his inferiors; it is _despicable_ in him to forfeit his word; it is _pitiful_ in him to attempt to conceal anything by artifice.  
**CONTEMPTUOUS, SCORNFUL, DISDAINFUL.** — These epithets rise in sense by a regular gradation. _Contemptuous_ is general, and applied to whatever can express _contempt: scornful_ and _disdainful_ are particular; they apply only to outward marks: one is _contemptuous_ who is _scornful_ or _disdainful_, but not _vice versa._ Words, actions, and looks are _contemptuous:_ looks, sneers, and gestures are _scornful_ and _disdainful. Contemptuous_ expressions are always unjustifiable; whatever may be the _contempt_ which a person's conduct deserves, it is unbecoming in another to give him any indications of the sentiment he feels. _Scornful_ and _disdainful_ smiles are resorted to by the weakest or the worst of mankind. 

####contend 
**CONTEND, CONTEST, DISPUTE.**  
_Contend_, from _tendo_, stretch, and _contra_, against, signifies to strive against. _Contest_, from _con_, against, and _testor_, from _testis_, a witness, signifying to call to witness against; and _dispute_, from _dis_ and _puto_, signifying to think diversely, are modes of _contending._  
To _contend_ is simply to exert a force against a force; to _contest_ is to struggle together for an object.  
To _contend_ and _contest_ may be both applied to that which is claimed and striven for; but _contending_ is the act of the individual without reference to others, where success depends upon personal efforts or prowess, as when one _contends_ at games. To _contest_ is to set up rival pretensions to be determined by the suffrage of others, as to _contest_ an election, to _contest_ a prize.  
Opinions may likewise be both _contended_ and _contested_, with this distinction, that to _contend_ is to maintain any opinion; to _contest_ is to maintain different opinions: the person is said to _contend_ and the thing to be _contested._  
To _dispute_, according to its original meaning, applies to opinions only, and is distinguished from _contend_ in this, that the latter signifies to maintain one's own opinion, and the former to call in question the opinion of another.  
In respect to matters of personal interest, _contend_ and _dispute_ are employed with a like distinction, the former to denote striving for something desired by one's self, the latter to call in question something relating to others, as to _contend_ for a victory, to _dispute_ a person's right; and when the idea of striving for a thing in _dispute_ is to be expressed, this word may be employed indifferently with _contend_ for, as to _dispute_ or _contend_ for a prize.  
_Contention, contest_, and _dispute_, as nouns, admit of a further distinction. _Contention_ is always of a personal nature, whether as regards interests or opinions, and is always accompanied with more or less ill feeling.  
_Contests_ may be as personal as _contentions_, but the objects in a _contest_ being higher, and the _contesting_ parties coming less into direct collision, there is less ill feeling produced.  
As differences of opinion have a tendency to create ill feeling, _disputes_ are rarely conducted without acrimony; but sometimes there may be _disputes_ for that which is honorable, where there is no personal animosity.

####contentment 
**CONTENTMENT, SATISFACTION.**  
_Contentment_, in French _contentement_, from _content_, in Latin _contentus_, participle of _contenere_, to contain or hold, signifies the keeping one's self to a thing. _Satisfaction_, in Latin _satisfactio_, compounded of _satis_, enough, and _facere_, to do, signifies the making or having enough.  
_Contentment_ lies in ourselves: _satisfaction_ is derived from external objects. One is _contented_ when one wishes for no more: one is _satisfied_ when one has obtained all one wishes. The _contented_ man has always enough; the _satisfied_ man has only enough for the time being. The _contented_ man will not be _dissatisfied;_ but he who looks for _satisfaction_ will never be _contented. Contentment_ is the absence of pain; _satisfaction_ is positive pleasure. _Contentment_ is accompanied with the enjoyment of what one has; _satisfaction_ is often quickly followed with the alloy of wanting more. A _contented_ man can never be miserable; a _satisfied_ man can scarcely be long happy. _Contentment_ is a permanent and habitual state of mind; it is the restriction of all our thoughts, views, and desires within the compass of present possession and enjoyment: _satisfaction_ is a partial and turbulent state of the feelings, which awakens rather than deadens desire. _Contentment_ is suited to our present condition; it accommodates itself to the vicissitudes of human life; _satisfaction_ belongs to no created being; one _satisfied_ desire engenders another that demands _satisfaction. Contentment_ is within the reach of the poor man, to whom it is a continual feast; but _satisfaction_ has never been procured by wealth, however enormous, or ambition, however boundless and successful. We should therefore look for the _contented_ man where there are the fewest means of being _satisfied._ Our duty bids us be _contented;_ our desires ask to be _satisfied:_ but our duty is associated with our happiness; our desires are the sources of our misery.  
When taken in a partial application to particular objects, there are cases in which we ought not to be _contented_, and where we may with propriety look for permanent _satisfaction._ We cannot be _contented_ to do less than our duty requires; we may justly be _satisfied_ with the consciousness of having done our duty.

####continual 
**CONTINUAL, PERPETUAL, CONSTANT.**  
_Continual_, in French _continuel_, Latin _continuus_, from _continere_, to hold or keep together, signifies keeping together without intermission. _Perpetual_, in French _perpétuel_, Latin _perpetualis_, from _perpeto_, compounded of _per_, meaning thoroughly, and _petere_, to seek, to seek thoroughly, signifies going on everywhere and at all times. _Constant_ (see [constancy](entry://constancy)).  
What is _continual_ admits of no interruption: what is _perpetual_ admits of no termination. There may be an end to that which is _continual_, and there may be intervals in that which is _perpetual._ Rains are _continual_ in the tropical climates at certain seasons: complaints among the lower orders are _perpetual_, but they are frequently without foundation. There is a _continual_ passing and repassing in the streets of the metropolis during the day; the world and all that it contains are subject to _perpetual_ change.  
_Constant_, like _continual_, admits of no interruption, and it also admits of no change; what is _continual_ may not always _continue_ in the same state, but what is _constant_ remains in the same state: _continual_ is therefore applied to that which is expected to cease, and _constant_ to that which ought to last. A nervous person may fancy he hears _continual_ noises. It will be the _constant_ endeavor of a peaceable man to live peaceably.  
_Continual_ may sometimes have a moral application; as when we say, _contentment_ is a _continual_ feast; to have a _continual_ enjoyment in anything: _constant_ is properly applied to moral objects.  
**CONTINUAL, CONTINUED.** — _Continual_ and _continued_ both mark length of duration, but the former admits of a certain degree of interruption, which the latter does not. What is _continual_ may have frequent pauses; what is _continued_ ceases only to terminate. Rains are continual which are frequently repeated; so noises in a tumultuous street are _continual_: the bass in music is said to be _continued;_ the mirth of a drunken party is one _continued_ noise. _Continual_ interruptions abate the vigor of application and create disgust: in countries situated near the poles, there is one _continued_ darkness for the space of five or six months, during which time the inhabitants are obliged to leave the place.  
_Continual_ respects the duration of actions only; _continued_ is likewise applied to the extent or course of things: rumors are _continual;_ talking, walking, running, and the like, are _continual;_ but a line, a series, a scene, or a stream of water is _continued._  
**CONTINUANCE, CONTINUATION, DURATION.** — _Continuance_, from the intransitive verb to _continue_, denotes the state of continuing or being carried on further. _Continuation_, from the transitive verb _continue_, denotes the act of continuing or carrying on further. The _continuance_ is said of that which itself _continues;_ the _continuation_, of that which is _continued_ by some other agency: as the _continuance_ of the rain; the _continuation_ of a history, work, line, etc.  
As the species is said to be _continued_, the word _continuation_ is most properly applied in this case.  
_Continuance_ and _duration_ are both employed for the time of _continuing;_ things may be of long _continuance_ or of long _duration;_ but _continuance_ is used only with regard to the action; _duration_ with regard to the thing and its existence. Whatever is occasionally done, and soon to be ended, is not for a _continuance;_ whatever is made, and soon destroyed, is not of long _duration:_ there are many excellent institutions in England which promise to be of no less _continuance_ than utility. _Duration_ is with us a relative term; things are of long or short _duration_ by comparison: the _duration_ of the world, and all sublunary objects, is nothing in regard to eternity.  
**CONTINUATION, CONTINUITY.** — _Continuation_ signifies either the act of continuing, as to undertake the _continuation_ or _continuing_ of a history; or the thing _continued;_ as to read the _continuation_ of a history — that is, the history _continued. Continuity_ denotes the quality of bodies holding together without interruption; there are bodies of so little _continuity_ that they will crumble to pieces on the slightest touch.  
**CONTINUE, REMAIN, STAY.** — _Continue_ (see [continual](entry://continual)). _Remain_, in Latin _remaneo_, is compounded of _re_, behind, and _manere_, to stay, and signifies to stay behind. _Stay_ is derived through French from Middle Dutch _stade_, which is allied to English _stead_, in _steadfast, steady_, etc., signifying place; it means to _remain_ in one place.  
The idea of keeping to an object is common to these terms. To _continue_ is associated with a state of action; to _remain_, with a state of rest: we are said to _continue_ to speak, walk, or do anything, to _continue_ in action or motion; to _remain_ stationary, or in a position.  
So likewise in application to the outward condition or the state of mind, _continue_ denotes that which is active and positive; _remain_, that which is quiescent and tranquil; to _continue_ in a course or in a belief; to _continue_ steadfast; to _remain_ in doubt.  
The same distinction exists between these words when things are the subjects: a war _continues;_ a stone _remains_ in the place where it is put.  
_Continue_ is frequently taken absolutely for continuing in action; _remain_, from the particle _re_, has a relative signification to something else: the sickness or the rain _continues;_ I will use my utmost endeavors as long as health _remains. Continue_ and _remain_ are used in respect of place; _stay_ is used in that of connection only. _Continue_ is indefinite in its application and signification; as to _continue_ in town or in the country: to _remain_ is an involuntary act; as a soldier _remains_ at his post, or a person _remains_ in prison: _stay_ is a voluntary act; as to _stay_ at a friend's or with a friend.  
**CONTINUE, PERSEVERE, PERSIST, PURSUE, PROSECUTE.** — _Continue_ (see above). _Persevere_, in French _persévérer_, Latin _perseverare_, compounded of _per_, through, and _severus_, strict and steady, signifies to be steady throughout or to the end. _Persist_, in French _persister_, Latin _persiste_, is compounded of _per_, through, and _sistere_, to put, and corresponds to the modern phrase "to put it through. " _Pursue_ and _prosecute_, in French _poursuivre_, come from the Latin _prosequor_ and its participle _prosecutus_, signifying to follow after or keep on with.  
The idea of not setting aside is common to these terms, which is the sense of _continue_ without any qualification; the other terms, which are all species of _continuing_, include likewise some collateral idea which distinguishes them from the first, as well as from one another. _Continue_ is comparable with _persevere_ and _persist_ in the neuter sense, with _pursue_ and _prosecute_ in the active sense. To _continue_ is simply to do as one has done hitherto; to _persevere_ is to _continue_ without wishing to change or from a positive desire to attain an object; to _persist_ is to _continue_ from a determination or will not to cease. The act of _continuing_, therefore, specifies no characteristic of the agent; that of _persevering_ or _persisting_ marks a direct temper of mind; the former is always used in a good sense, the latter in an indifferent or bad sense. We _continue_ from habit or casualty; we _persevere_ from reflection and the exercise of our judgment; we _persist_ from attachment. It is not the most exalted virtue to _continue_ in a good course merely because we have been in the habit of so doing: what is done from habit merely, without any fixed principle, is always exposed to change from the influence of passion or evil counsel; there is real virtue in the act of _perseverance_, without which many of our best intentions would remain unfulfilled and our best plans would be defeated: those who do not _persevere_ can do no essential good; and those who do _persevere_ often effect what has appeared to be impracticable; of this truth the discoverer of America is a remarkable proof, who, in spite of every mortification, rebuff, and disappointment, _persevered_ in calling the attention of monarchs to his project, until he at length obtained the assistance requisite for effecting the discovery of a new world.  
The Romans have not observed this distinction between _perseverare_ and _persistere_; for they say, "In errore _perseverare_: " CICERO. "Ad ultimum _perseverare_: " LIVY. "In eadem impudentiâ _persistere_: " LIVY. "In proposito _persistere_: " CICERO. Probably in imitation of them, examples are to be found in English writers of the use of _persevere_ in the bad sense, and of _persist_ in the good sense; but the distinction is now invariably observed. _Persevere_ is employed only in matters of some moment, in things of sufficient importance to demand a steady purpose of the mind; _persist_ may be employed in that which is trifling, if not bad: a learner _perseveres_ in his studies, in order to arrive at the necessary degree of improvement; a child _persists_ in making a request until he has obtained the object of his desire: there is always wisdom in _perseverance_, even though unsuccessful; there is mostly folly, caprice, or obstinacy in _persistence:_ how different the man who _perseveres_ in the cultivation of his talents from him who only _persists_ in maintaining falsehoods or supporting errors!  
_Continue_, when compared with _persevere_ or _persist_, is always coupled with modes of action: but in comparison with _pursue_ or _prosecute_, it is always followed by some object: we _continue_ to do, _persevere_ or _persist_ in doing something: but we _continue, pursue_, or _prosecute_ some object which we wish to bring to perfection by additional labor. _Continue_ is equally indefinite as in the former case; _pursue_ and _prosecute_ both comprehend collateral ideas respecting the disposition of the agent and the nature of the object: to _continue_ is to go on with a thing as it has been begun; to _pursue_ and _prosecute_ is to _continue_ by some prescribed rule, or in some particular manner: a work is _continued;_ a plan, measure, or line of conduct is _pursued;_ an undertaking or a design is _prosecuted:_ we may _continue_ the work of another in order to supply a deficiency: we may _pursue_ a plan that emanates either from ourselves or another; we _prosecute_ our own work only in order to obtain some peculiar object: _continue_, therefore, expresses less than _pursue_, and this less than _prosecute:_ the history of England has been _continued_ down to the present period by different writers; Smollett has _pursued_ the same plan as Hume in the _continuation_ of his history; Captain Cook _prosecuted_ his work of discovery in three several voyages. To _continue_ is itself altogether an indifferent action; to _pursue_ and _prosecute_ are commendable actions; the latter still more than the former: it is a mark of great instability not to _continue_ anything that we begin; it betrays a great want of prudence and discernment not to _pursue_ some plan on every occasion which requires method; it is the characteristic of a _persevering_ mind to _prosecute_ whatever it has deemed worthy to enter upon.

####contraband 
**CONTRABAND, FORBIDDEN, PROHIBITED.**  
_Contraband is_ derived through Spanish and Italian from Latin _contra_, against, and Italian _bando_, Late Latin _bannum_, a word of Teutonic origin found in _abandon, ban_, etc. It means literally a _ban_ against something, and refers to a special kind of _forbidding_ or _prohibiting._ McCulloch, in the "Commercial Dictionary, " gives the following succinct definition of the perplexing phrase _contraband of war: "_When two nations are engaged in war, if there be any foreign article or articles necessary for the defence or subsistence of either of them, and without which it would be difficult for it to carry on the contest, the other may legitimately exert every means in its power to prevent its opponent being supplied with such article or articles. "  
Such goods are called _contraband of war._ After _forbidding_ the importation of such goods by a legal proclamation, a nation may use every means to _prohibit_ the enemy from obtaining the _contraband_ articles. For a further definition of the difference between _forbid_ and _prohibit_ see [ban ](entry://ban )and FORBID. 

####contract 
See [abridge](entry://abridge); [agreement](entry://agreement)

####contracted 
**CONTRACTED, CONFINED, NARROW.**  
These words agree in denoting a limited space; but _contracted_, from _contraho_, draw together, signifying drawn into a smaller compass than it might otherwise be in, and _confined_ (see [bound](entry://bound)), signifying brought within unusually small bounds, are said of that which is made or becomes so by circumstances. _Narrow_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _nearu_, closely drawn. A limb is said to be _contracted_ which is drawn up by disease; a situation is _confined_ which has not the necessary or usual degree of open space; a road or a room is _narrow._  
These terms are figuratively applied to moral objects with the same distinction: the mind is _contracted_ by education or habit; a person's views are _confined_ by reason of his ignorance; people have for the most part a temper _narrow_ by nature. 

####contradict 
**CONTRADICT, DENY, OPPOSE.**  
_Contradict_, from the Latin _contra_, against, and _dictum_, speech, signifies a speech against a speech. _Deny_ is derived from Latin _de_ and _negare_, to say "no, " from the negative particle _ne_, and signifies to say "no. " _Oppose_ comes from Latin _ob_, in the way of, and French _poser_ (see [compose](entry://compose)), and signifies to place in the way of.  
To _contradict_, as the origin of the word sufficiently denotes, is to set up one assertion against another, but it does not necessarily imply an intentional act. The _contradiction_ may he in the force of the terms, whence logicians call those propositions _contradictory_ which in all their terms are directly opposed to each other: as, "All men are liars"; "No men are liars. " A person may _contradict_ himself, or two witnesses may _contradict_ each other who have had no communication.  
To _deny_ is to assert the falsehood of another's assertion, and is therefore a direct and personal act; as to _deny_ any one's statement.  
_Contradictions_ may be given at the pleasure or for the convenience of the parties; _denials_ are made in support either of truth or falsehood, in matters of fact or matters of opinion.  
One _contradicts_ in direct terms by asserting something contrary; one _denies_ by advancing arguments or suggesting doubts or difficulties, These terms may therefore both be used in reference to disputations. We may _deny_ the truth of a position by _contradicting_ the assertions that are advanced in its support.  
_Contradiction_ and _denial_ are commonly performed by words only; _opposition_, by any kind of action or mode of expression. We may therefore sometimes _oppose_ by _contradiction_, although not properly by _denial; contradicting_ and _opposing_ being both voluntary acts, _denying_ frequently a matter of necessity or for self-defence.

####contrive 
**CONTRIVE, DEVISE, INVENT.**  
_Contrive_ in Old French _controver_, compounded of Latin _con_, together, and a stressed stem of Old French _trover_, to find, signifies to find out by putting together. _Devise_, compounded of _de_ and Latin _visus_, seen, signifies to show or present to the mind. _Invent_, in Latin _inventus_, participle of _invenire_, compounded of _in_, in, and _venire_, to come, signifies to come or bring into the mind.  
_Contriving_ requires less exercise of the thoughts than _devising:_ we _contrive_ on familiar and common occasions; we _devise_ in seasons of difficulty and trial. A _contrivance_ is simple and obvious to a plain understanding: a _device_ is complex and far-fetched; it requires a ready conception and a degree of art. _Contrivances_ serve to supply a deficiency or increase a convenience; _devices_ are employed to extricate from danger, to remove an evil, or forward a scheme: the history of Robinson Crusoe derives considerable interest from the relation of the various _contrivances_ by which he provided himself with the first articles of necessity and comfort; the history of robbers and adventurers is full of the various _devices_ by which they endeavor to carry on their projects of plunder or elude the vigilance of their pursuers.  
To _contrive_ and _devise_ do not express so much as to _invent:_ we _contrive_ and _devise_ in small matters; we _invent_ in those of greater moment. _Contriving_ and _devising_ respect the manner of doing things; _inventing_ comprehends the action and the thing itself; the former are but the new fashioning of things that already exist; the latter is, as it were, the creation of something new: to _contrive_ and _devise_ are intentional actions, the result of a specific effort; _invention_ naturally arises from the exertion of an inherent power: we require thought and combination to _contrive_ or _devise;_ ingenuity is the faculty which is exerted in _inventing. A device_ is often employed for bad and fraudulent purposes; _contrivances_ mostly serve the innocent purposes of life; _inventions_ are mostly good, unless they are stories _invented_, which are always false.

####controvert 
**CONTROVERT, DISPUTE.**  
_Controvert_, compounded of the Latin _contra_, against, and _vertere_, to turn, signifies to turn against another in discourse, or direct one's self against another. _Dispute_ (see [argue](entry://argue)).  
To _controvert_ has regard to speculative points; to _dispute_ respects matters of fact: there is more of opposition in _controversy;_ more of doubt in _disputing:_ a sophist _controverts;_ a sceptic _disputes:_ the plainest and sublimest truths of the Gospel have been all _controverted_ in their turn by the self-sufficient inquirer: the authenticity of the Bible itself has been _disputed_ by some few individuals: the existence of a God by still fewer. _Controversy_ is worse than an unprofitable task; instead of eliciting truth, it does but expose the failings of the parties engaged: _disputing_ is not so personal, and consequently not so objectionable: we never _controvert_ any point without seriously and decidedly intending to oppose the notions of another; we may sometimes _dispute_ a point for the sake of friendly argument or the desire of information: theologians and politicians are the greatest _controversialists:_ it is the business of men in general to _dispute_ whatever ought not to be taken for granted. 

####contumacious 
See [obstinate](entry://obstinate)

####contumacy 
**CONTUMACY, REBELLION.**  
_Contumacy_, from the Latin _contumax_, compounded of _contra_, against, and _tumere_, to swell, signifies the swelling one's self up by way of resistance. _Rebellion_, in Latin _rebellio_, compounded of _re_, in return, and _bellum_, war, signifies carrying on war against those to whom we owe, and have before paid, a lawful subjection.  
Resistance to lawful authority is the common idea included in the signification of both these terms, but _contumacy_ does not express so much as _rebellion:_ the _contumacious_ resist only occasionally; the _rebel_ resists systematically: the _contumacious_ stand only on certain points, and oppose the individual; the _rebel_ sets himself up against the authority itself: the _contumacious_ thwart and contradict, they never resort to open violence: the _rebel_ acts only by main force; _contumacy_ shelters itself under the plea of equity and justice; _rebellion_ sets all law and order at defiance.

**CONVENIENT, SUITABLE.**  
_Convenient_ (see [commodious](entry://commodious)). _Suitable_ (see [conformable](entry://conformable)).  
_Convenient_ regards the circumstances of the individual; _suitable_ respects the established opinions of mankind, and is closely connected with moral propriety: nothing is _convenient_ which does not favor one's purpose: nothing is _suitable_ which does not suit the person, place, and thing: whoever has anything to ask of another must take a _convenient_ opportunity in order to insure success: his address on such an occasion would be very _unsuitable_ if he affected to claim as a right what he ought to solicit as a favor.

####convention 
**CONVENTION, AGREEMENT, COMPACT, TREATY.**  
_Convention_, in French the same form, from Latin _con_, together, and _venire_, to come, in the diplomatic sense in which it is here used signifies literally an agreement as distinguished from an assembly of a political character. In international disputes or warfare it has frequently been the custom for the disputants to seek a peaceable solution of the trouble between them, the first step being a meeting of mutual delegates to ascertain what demands and concessions are likely to be made.  
This meeting may formulate terms, which are usually of a tentative character, and afterward plenipotentiaries are appointed to negotiate a formal _agreement, compact_, and sometimes a _treaty_ itself. The final engagement becomes effective only on its ratification by each disputant. The plenipotentiaries, instructed on general Unes by their respective governments, give and take, and their agreement is almost always accepted as binding by their governments.

####conversant 
**CONVERSANT, FAMILIAR.**  
_Conversant_, from _con_, together, and _versari_, to dwell, signifies dwelling together, hence familiar with, consequently becoming acquainted. _Familiar_, from the Latin _familiaris_, to be of the same family, signifies the closest connection.  
An acquaintance with things is implied in both these terms, but the latter expresses something more particular than the former. A person is _conversant_ in matters that come frequently before his notice; he is _familiar_ with such as form the daily routine of his business: one who is not a professed lawyer may be _conversant_ with the questions of law which occur on ordinary occasions; but one who is skilled in his profession will be _familiar_ with all cases which may possibly be employed in support or a cause: it is advisable to be _conversant_ with the ways of the world; but to be _familiar_ with the greater part of them would not redound to one's credit or advantage.  
**CONVERSATION, DIALOGUE, CONFERENCE, COLLOQUY.** — _Conversation_ denotes the act of holding _converse_ (see **communion** under [communicate](entry://communicate)). _Dialogue_, in French _dialogue_, Latin _dialogus_, Greek _διάλογος_, compounded of _διά_ and _λόγος_, signifies a speech between two. _Conference_, from the Latin _con_, together, and _ferre_, to bring, signifies consulting together on subjects. _Colloquy_, in Latin _colloquium_, from _con_, together, and _loquor_, speak, signifies the art of talking together.  
A _conversation_ is always something actually held between two or more persons; a _dialogue_ is mostly fictitious, and written as if spoken: any number of persons may take part in a _conversation_, but a _dialogue_ always refers to the two persons who are expressly engaged: a _conversation_ may be desultory; a _dialogue_ is formal, in which there will always be reply and rejoinder: a _conversation_ may be carried on by any signs besides words, which are addressed personally to the individual present; a _dialogue_ must always consist of express words: a prince holds frequent _conversations_ with his ministers on affairs of state; Cicero wrote _dialogues_ on the nature of the gods, and many later writers have adopted the _dialogue_ form as a vehicle for conveying their sentiments: a _conference_ is a species of _conversation;_ a _colloquy_ is a species of _dialogue:_ a _conversation_ is indefinite as to the subject or the parties engaged in it: a _conference_ is confined to particular subjects and descriptions of persons: a _conversation_ is mostly occasional: a _conference_ is always specifically appointed: a _conversation_ is mostly on indifferent matters; a _conference_ is mostly on national or public concerns: we have a _conversation_ as friends; we have a _conference_ as ministers of state. The _dialogue_ naturally limits the number to two; the _colloquy_ is indefinite as to number: there may be _dialogues_, therefore, which are not _colloquies;_ but every _colloquy_ may be denominated a _dialogue._

####convert 
**CONVERT, PROSELYTE.**  
_Convert_, from the Latin _converto_, signifies changed to something in conformity with the views of another. _Proselyte_, from the Greek _πρός_, to, and _ήλυθον_, second aorist of _έρχομαι_, I come, signifies come over to the side of another.  
_Convert_ is more extensive in its sense and application than _proselyte: convert_ in its full sense includes every change of opinion, without respect to the subject; _proselyte_, in its original application, denoted changes only from one religious belief to another: there are many _converts_ to particular doctrines of Christianity, and _proselytes_ from the Pagan, Jewish, or Mohammedan to the Christian faith; but the word _proselyte_ has since acquired an application which distinguishes it from _convert. Conversion_ is a more voluntary act than _proselytism;_ it emanates, entirely from the mind of the agent, independently of foreign influence; it extends not merely to the abstract or speculative opinions of the individual, but to the whole current of his feelings and spring of his actions: it is the _conversion_ of the heart and soul. _Proselytism_ is an outward act, which need not extend beyond the conformity of one's words and actions to a certain rule: _convert_ is therefore always taken in a good sense; it bears on the face of it the stamp of sincerity: _proselyte_ is a term of more ambiguous meaning; the _proselyte_ is often the creature and tool of a party: there may be many _proselytes_ where there are no _converts._ The _conversion_ of a sinner is the work of God's grace, either by His special interposition or by the ordinary influence of His Holy Word on the heart: partisans are always anxious to make _proselytes_ to their own party.

####convict 
**CONVICT, DETECT.**  
_Convict_, from the Latin _convictus_, participle of _convinco_, I make manifest, signifies to make guilt clear. _Detect_, from the Latin _detectus_, participle of _detego_, compounded of the privative _de_ and _tegere_, to cover, signifies to uncover or lay open guilt.  
A person is _convicted_ by means of evidence; he is _detected_ by means of ocular demonstration. One is _convicted_ of having been the perpetrator of some evil deed; one is _detected_ in the very act of committing the deed. Whatever serves to prove the guilt of another is said to _convict_, whether the _conviction_ be by others or by one's self: a man may be _convicted_ in his own mind, as well as in the opinion of others, before a public tribunal or by private individuals; _detection_ is confined to the act of the individual, which is laid open to others. See also **criminal** under [crime](entry://crime) _4Convict, Convince, Persuade._ — To _convict_ is to satisfy a person of another's guilt or error. To _convince_ is to satisfy the person himself of the truth or falsehood of a thing.  
A person may be _convicted_ of heresy, if it be proved to the satisfaction of others; he may be _convinced_ that the opinion which he has held is heretical. So a person may be _convicted_ who is involuntarily _convinced_ of his error, but he is _convinced_ if he is made sensible of his error without any force on his own mind. One is _convicted_ only of that which is false or bad, but one is _convinced_ of that which is true as well as that which is false. The noun _conviction_ is used in both the senses of _convict_ and _convince._  
What _convinces_ binds; what _persuades_ attracts. We are _convinced_ by arguments; it is the understanding which determines: we are _persuaded_ by entreaties and personal influence; it is the imagination or will which decides. Our _conviction_ respects solely matters of belief or faith; our _persuasion_ respects matters of belief or practice: we are _convinced_ that a thing is true or false; we are _persuaded_ that it is either right or wrong, advantageous or the contrary. A person will have half effected a thing who is _convinced_ that it is in his power to effect it; he will be easily _persuaded_ to do that which favors his own interests.  
_Conviction_ respects our most important duties; _persuasion_ is applied to matters of indifference, or of temporary personal interest. The first step to true repentance is a thorough _conviction_ of the enormity of sin. The cure of people's maladies is sometimes promoted to a surprising degree by their _persuasion_ of the efficacy of the remedy.  
As _conviction_ is the effect of substantial evidence, it is solid and permanent in its nature; it cannot be so easily changed and deceived: _persuasion_, depending on our feelings, is influenced by external objects, and exposed to various changes; it may vary both in the degree and in the object. _Conviction_ answers in our minds to positive certainty; _persuasion_ answers to probability. We ought to be _convinced_ of the propriety of avoiding everything which can interfere with the good order of society; we may be _persuaded_ of the truth of a person's narrative or not, according to the representation made to us; we may be _persuaded_ to pursue any study or lay it aside.

####convivial 
**CONVIVIAL, SOCIAL.**  
_Convivial_, in Latin _convivialis_, from _con_, together, and _vivere_, to live, signifies being entertained together. _Social_, from _socius_, a companion, signifies pertaining to company.  
The prominent idea in _convivial_ is that of sensual indulgence; the prominent idea in _social is_ that of enjoyment from an intercourse with society. _Convivial_ is a species of the _social_, it is the _social_ in matters of festivity. What is _convivial_ is social, but what is _social_ is something more; the former is excelled by the latter as much as the body is excelled by the mind. We speak of _convivial_ meetings, _convivial_ enjoyments, or the _convivial_ board; but _social_ intercourse, _social_ pleasure, _social_ amusements, and the like.

####cool 
**COOL, COLD, FRIGID.**  
In the natural sense, _cool_ is simply the absence of warmth; _cold_ and _frigid_ are positively contrary to warmth; the former in regard to objects in general, the latter to moral objects: in the figurative sense the analogy is strictly preserved. _Cool_ is used as it respects the passions and the affections; _cold_ only with regard to the affections; _frigid_ only in regard to the inclinations. With regard to the passions; _cool_ designates a freedom from agitation, which is a desirable quality. _Coolness_ in a time of danger, and _coolness_ in an argument, are alike commendable. As _cool_ and _cold_ respect the affections, the _cool_ is opposed to the friendly, the _cold_ to the warmhearted; the _frigid_ to the animated; the former is but a degree of the latter. A reception is said to be _cool_, an embrace to be _cold_, a sentiment _frigid. Coolness_ is an enemy to social enjoyments; _coldness_ is an enemy to affection; _frigidity_ destroys all force of character. _Coolness_ is engendered by circumstances; it supposes the previous existence of warmth; _coldness_ lies often in the temperament, or is engendered by habit; it is always something vicious; _frigidity_ is occasional, and is always a defect. Trifling differences produce _coolness_ sometimes between the best friends: trade sometimes engenders a _cold_, calculating temper in some minds: those who are remarkable for apathy will often express themselves with _frigid_ indifference on the most important subjects.

####copy 
**COPY, TRANSCRIBE.**  
_Copy_ is derived from the Latin _copia_, abundance, and signifies to create an abundance of some article by duplicating it or _copying. Transcribe_, in Latin _transcribe_, that is, _trans_, over, and _scribere_, to write, signifies literally to write over from something else, to make to pass over in writing from one paper or substance to the other.  
To _copy_ respects the matter; to _transcribe_ respects simply the act of writing. What is _copied_ must be taken immediately from the original, with which it must exactly correspond; what is _transcribed_ may be taken from the _copy_, but not necessarily, in an entire state. Things are _copied_ for the sake of getting the contents; they are often _transcribed_ for the sake of clearness and fair writing. A _copier_ should be very exact; a _transcriber_ should be a good writer. Lawyers _copy_ deeds, and have them afterward frequently _transcribed_ as occasion requires.  
See also [suitable](entry://suitable)  
**COPY, MODEL, PATTERN, SPECIMEN.** — _Copy_, from the verb to _copy_, marks either the thing from which we _copy_ or the thing _copied. Model_, in French _modèle_, Latin _modulus_, a little mode or measure, signifies the thing that serves as a measure or that is made after a measure. _Pattern_, which is a variation of _patron_, from the Latin _patronus_, whence English _patron_ is derived, signifies the thing that directs. _Specimen_, in Latin _specimen_, from _specere_, to behold, signifies what is looked at for the purpose of forming one's judgment by it.  
A _copy_ and a _model_ imply either that which is _copied_ or taken from something, as when we speak of a _copy_ in distinction from an original, and of making a _model_ of anything.  
Or they imply that from which anything is _copied_ or taken, as to follow a _copy_, to choose a _model._  
The term _copy is_ applied to that which is delineated, as writings or pictures, which must be taken faithfully and literally; the _model_, to that which may be represented in wood or stone, and which serves as a guide.  
In application to other objects, a _copy_ may be either that which is made or done in imitation, or it may be that which is imitated.  
A _model_ is that which may be used as a guide or rule.  
_Pattern_ and _specimen_ serve, like the _model_, to guide or regulate, but differ in the nature of the objects; the _pattern_ regards solely the outward form or color of anything that is made or manufactured, as the _pattern_ of a carpet; a person fixes on having a thing according to a certain _pattern;_ the _specimen_ is any portion of a material which serves to show the quality of that of which it forms a part, as the _specimen_ of a printed work; the value of things is estimated by the _specimen._  
In the moral application _pattern_ respects the whole conduct or behavior which may deserve imitation; _specimen_ only the detached parts by which a judgment may be formed of the whole: the female who devotes her whole time and attention to the management of her family and the education of her offspring is a _pattern_ to those of her sex who depute the whole concern to others. A person gives but an unfortunate _specimen_ of his boasted sincerity who is found guilty of an evasion. 

####coquette 
**COQUETTE, FLIRT, JILT.**  
_Coquette_ is in French the feminine form of _coquet_, a little cock, and signified a proud and strutting little creature, hence a woman who seeks admiration and attention. _Flirt_ is an imitative word which originally meant to jerk lightly away, hence to tease, mock, gibe. _Jilt_ is a diminutive of _Jill_, a girl's name, contracted from Latin Juliana, and frequently found in old rhymes and proverbs — "Every Jack must have his Jill, " "Jack and Jill went up the hill, " etc. Of these words the more recent term, _flirt_, has partly replaced the older words, _coquette_ and _jilt. Flirt_ is a more vulgar term than _coquette._ There is something of a fine lady in the _coquette._ The _flirt_ uses the natural arts of an ordinary girl; the _coquette_ is the product of a refined and sophisticated society. The _coquette_ has more daintiness and apparently more reserve than the _flirt_, but she may be more heartless ana less innocent. _Jilt_ is a word which formerly was much more commonly employed than at present; now it survives mainly in the verb to _jilt_, to break one's engagement. The older distinction between _coquette_ and _jilt_ is expressed by Crabb as follows: _Coquetry_ is contented with employing little arts to excite notice; _jilting_ extends to the violation of truth and honor, in order to awaken a passion which it afterward disappoints. Vanity is the mainspring by which _coquettes_ and _jilts_ are impelled to action; but the former indulges her propensity mostly at her own expense only, while the latter does no less injury to the peace of others than she does to her own reputation. The _coquette_ makes a traffic of her own charms by seeking a multitude of admirers; the _jilt_ sports with the sacred passion of love, and barters it for the gratification of any selfish propensity. _Coquetry_ is a fault which should be guarded against by every female as a snare to her own happiness; _jilting_ is a vice which cannot be practised without some depravity of the heart. 

####cordial

####corner 
**CORNER, ANGLE.**  
_Corner_ comes from Latin _cornu_, signifying a horn or projection. _Angle_, in Latin _angulus_, comes in all probability from _άγκύλος_, the elbow.  
_Corner_ properly implies the outer extreme point of any solid body; _angle_, on the contrary, the inner extremity produced by the meeting of two right lines or plane surfaces. When speaking, therefore, of solid bodies, _corner_ and _angle_ may be both employed; but in regard to simple right lines, or plane surfaces, the word _angle_ only is applicable; in the former case a _comer_ is produced by the meeting of the different parts of a body, whether inwardly or outwardly; but an _angle_ is produced by the meeting of two bodies; inwardly one house has many _corners;_ two houses, or two walls at least, are requisite to make an _angle._

####corporal 
**CORPORAL, CORPOREAL, BODILY.**  
_Corporal, corporeal_, and _bodily_, as their origin bespeaks, have all relation to the same object, the _body;_ but the two former are employed to signify relating or appertaining to the _body_, the latter to denote containing or forming part of the _body._ Hence we say _corporal_ punishment, _bodily_ vigor or strength, _corporeal_ substances; the Godhead _bodily_, the _corporeal_ frame, _bodily_ exertion. _Corporal_ is only employed for the animal frame in its proper sense; _corporeal_ is used for animal substance in an extended sense; hence we speak of _corporal_ sufferance and _corporeal_ agents. _Corporeal_ is distinguished from spiritual; _bodily_ from mental. It is impossible to represent spiritual beings any other way than under a _corporeal_ form; _bodily_ pains, however severe, are frequently overpowered by mental pleasures.  
**CORPOREAL, MATERIAL.** — _Corporeal_ is properly a species of _material;_ whatever is _corporeal_ is _material_, but not _vice versa. Corporeal_ respects animated bodies; _material_ is used for everything which can act on the senses, animate or inanimate. The world contains _corporeal_ beings, and consists of _material_ substances.  
See also [tangible](entry://tangible)  
**CORPULENT, STOUT, LUSTY.** — _Corpulent_, from _corpus_, the body, signifies having fulness of body. _Stout_, Anglo-Saxon _stolt_, is allied to German _stolz_, proud, and possibly to Latin _stultus_, foolhardy; it signifies strength and self-assertion resulting from a large physical frame; hence, in some cases, the large physique itself. _Lusty_, in German, etc., _lustig_, merry, cheerful, implies here a vigorous state of body.  
_Corpulent_ respects the fleshy state of the body; _stout_ respects also the state of the muscles and bones: _corpulence_ is therefore an incidental property; _stoutness_ is a natural property: _corpulence_ may come upon us according to circumstances; _stoutness_ is the natural make of the body which is born with us. _Corpulence_ and _lustiness_ are both occasioned by the state of the health; but the former may arise from disease, the latter is always the consequence of good health: _corpulence_ consists of an undue proportion of fat; _lustiness_ consists of a due and full proportion of all the solids in the body. 

####correct 
**CORRECT, RECTIFY, REFORM.**  
_Correct_ (see [amend](entry://amend)) is more definite in its meaning, and more general in its application, than _rectify_, which, from _rectus_ and _facio_, signifies simply to make right or as it should be.  
To _correct_ is an act of necessity or discretion; to _rectify_, an act of discretion only. What is _corrected_ is substantially faulty; what is _rectified_ may be faulty by accident or from inadvertence. Faults in the execution are _corrected;_ mistakes are _rectified._  
To _reform_, from _re_, again, and _formare_, to form, signifies to form again, or put into a new form; it expresses, therefore, more than _correct_, which removes that which is faulty in a thing without altering the thing itself. _Correction_ may produce only a partial change, but what is _reformed_ assumes a new form and becomes a new thing.  
They are employed also in respect to public matters with a like distinction: abuses are _corrected_, the state is _reformed._  
**CORRECT, ACCURATE.** — _Correct_ is equivalent to _corrected_, or set to rights. _Accurate_, from Latin _ad_, to, and _cura_, care, signifies done with care, or by the application of care. _Correct_ applies to that which is done according to rules which either a man prescribes to himself or are prescribed for him; _accurate_, to that which is done by application of the mind or attention to an object: the result in both cases will be nearly the same — namely, that the thing will be as it ought or is intended to be, but there is a shade of difference in the meaning and application. What is done by the exercise of the judgment is said to be _correct_, as a _correct_ style, a _correct_ writer, a _correct_ way of thinking; what is done by the effort of the individual is more properly _accurate_, as _accurate_ observations, an _accurate_ survey, and the like.  
When applied to the same objects, _correct_ is negative, it is opposed to _incorrect_ or faulty; _accurate_ is positive, it is opposed to _inaccurate_ or loose: it is sufficient to be free from fault to be _correct;_ it must contain every minute particular to be _accurate:_ information is _correct_ which contains nothing but facts; it is _accurate_ when it contains all the details of dates, persons, and circumstances given _accurately._  
**CORRECTION, DISCIPLINE, PUNISHMENT.** — As _correction_ and _discipline_ have commonly required _punishment_ to render them efficacious, custom has affixed to them a strong resemblance in their application, although they are distinguished from each other by obvious marks of difference. The prominent idea in _correction_ is that of making right what has been wrong. In _discipline_, from the Latin _disciplina_ and _discere_, to learn, the leading idea is that of instructing or regulating. In _punishment_, from the Latin _punio_, and the Greek _ποινή_, penalty; the leading idea is that of inflicting pain as a penalty for wrong-doing.  
We remove an evil by _correction;_ we prevent it by _discipline. Correction_ extends no further than to the _correcting_ of particular faults; but _discipline_ serves to train, guide, and instruct generally.  
When _correction_ and _discipline_ are taken in the sense of _punishment_, they mean _punishment_ for the purpose of _correction_ and _discipline: punishment_, on the other hand, means the infliction of pain as the consequence of any particular conduct. _Correction_ and _discipline_ are personal acts, and mostly acts of authority. A parent inflicts _correction_, a master exercises _discipline: punishment_ may either be inflicted by persons or result from things: the want of proper _discipline_ may be _punished_ by insubordination.

####correspondent 
**CORRESPONDENT, ANSWERABLE, SUITABLE.**  
_Correspondent_, from Latin _cum_, together, and _respondere_, to answer, signifies to answer in unison or in uniformity. _Answerable_ and _suitable_, from _answer_ and _suit_, mark the quality or capacity of _answering_ or _suiting. Correspondent_ supposes a greater agreement than _answerable_, and _answerable_ requires a greater agreement than _suitable._ Things that _correspond_ must be alike in size, shape, color, and in every minute particular; those that _answer_ must be fitted for the same purpose; those that _suit_ must have nothing disproportionate or discordant. In the artificial dispositions of furniture, or all matters of art and ornament, it is of considerable importance to have some things made to _correspond_, so that they be placed in _suitable_ directions to _answer_ to each other.  
In the moral application, actions are said not to _correspond_ with professions; the success of an undertaking does not _answer_ the expectations; particular measures do not _suit_ the purpose of individuals. It ill _corresponds_ with a profession of friendship to refuse assistance to a friend in the time of need; wild schemes undertaken without thought will never _answer_ the expectations of the projectors; it never _suits_ the purpose of the selfish and greedy to contribute to the relief of the necessitous.

####cosmos 
**COSMOS, EARTH, UNIVERSE, WORLD.**  
These words all indicate the world in which we live, but they differ considerably in their application and connotations. _Cosmos_, from Greek _κόσμος_, order, ornament, was so called by Pythagoras or his disciples from its "perfect order and arrangement. " _Cosmos_ corresponds very nearly to _universe_ (from Latin _unus_, and _vertere_, meaning turned into one, combined into a whole), with the additional suggestion of harmonious system. _Universe_ refers to the whole infinite extent of life and form; _cosmos_ to the whole orderly scheme of things as they are. _World_ and _earth_ are Anglo-Saxon terms. _World_, from _wer_, man, and _eld_, age, meant originally a lifetime, a course of life, and age; and referred to the whole of the present creation, which was thought of as having been brought into existence at a particular time, and doomed to extinction at some future time. It is a more extensive word than earth, but less extensive than _universe_ or _cosmos. Earth_, Anglo-Saxon _eorth_, signifies the ground under our feet — as distinguished from the heavens above — and now refers to the particular globe on which we live. 

####cost 
**COST, EXPENSE, PRICE, CHARGE.**  
_Cost_ is derived through Old French _coster_, from Latin _con_, together, and _stare_, to stand, and signified, literally, to support, and, in an extended sense, what is given for support. _Expense_ is compounded of _ex_ and Latin _pensus_, participle of _pendere_, to weigh, signifying the thing paid or given out. _Price_, from the Latin _pretium_, price, signifies the thing given for what is bought. _Charge_, from Latin _carricare_, to load a _car_, signifies the thing laid on as a burden in return for something received.  
The _cost_ is what a thing _costs_, or what is to be laid out for it; the _expense_ is that which a person actually lays out; the _price_ is that which a thing may fetch or which it may be worth; the _charge_ is that which a person or thing is _charged_ with. As a _cost_ commonly comprehends an _expense_, the terms are on various occasions used indifferently for each other: we speak of counting the _cost_ or counting the _expense_ of doing anything; at a great _cost_ or at a great _expense:_ on the other hand, of doing a thing to one's _cost_, of growing wise at other people's _expense._ The _cost_ and the _price_ have respect to the thing and its supposed value; the _expense_ and the _charge_ depend on the option of the persons. The _cost_ of a thing must precede the _price_, and the _expense_ must succeed the _charge:_ we can never set a _price_ on anything until we have ascertained what it has _cost_ us; nor can we know or defray the _expense_ until the _charge_ be made. There may, however, frequently be a _price_ where there is no _cost_, and _vice versa:_ there may also be an _expense_ where there is no _charge;_ but there cannot be a _charge_ without an _expense:_ what _costs_ nothing sometimes fetches a high _price_, and other things cannot obtain a _price_ equal to the first _cost. Expenses_ vary with modes of living and men's desires; whoever wants much, or wants that which is not easily obtained, will have many _expenses_ to defray; when the _charges_ are exorbitant, the _expenses_ must necessarily bear a proportion.  
Between the epithets _costly_ and _expensive_ there is the same distinction. Whatever is _costly_ is naturally _expensive_, but not _vice versa._ Articles of furniture, of luxury, or indulgence are _costly_, either from their variety or their intrinsic value; everything is _expensive_ which is attended with much _expense_, whether of little or great value. Jewels are _costly;_ travelling is _expensive._ The _costly_ treasures of the East are imported into Europe for the gratification of those who cannot be contented with the produce of their native soil: those who indulge themselves in such _expensive_ pleasures often lay up in store for themselves much sorrow and repentance in the time to come.  
In the moral acceptation, the attainment of an object is said to _cost_ much pains; a thing is persisted in at the _expense_ of health, of honor, or of life. The sacrifice of a man's quiet is the _price_ which he must pay for the gratification of his ambition.

####countenance 
**COUNTENANCE, SANCTION, SUPPORT.**  
_Countenance_ comes from Latin _con_, together, and _tenere_, to hold together, to control, referring to the personal demeanor, hence to the face. To _countenance_ means to keep in _countenance. Sanction_, in French _sanction_, Latin _sanctio_, from _sanctus_, sacred, signifies to ratify a decree or ordinance; in an extended sense, to make anything binding. _Support_, in French _supporter_, Latin _supporte_, compounded of _sub_ and _porto_, to bear, signifies to bear from underneath, to bear up.  
Persons are _countenanced;_ things are _sanctioned;_ persons or things are _supported:_ persons are _countenanced_ in their proceedings by the apparent approbation of others; measures are _sanctioned_ by the consent or approbation of others who have due authority; measures or persons are _supported_ by every means which may forward the object. There is most of encouragement in _countenancing;_ it consists of some outward demonstration of regard or good-will toward the person: there is most of authority in _sanctioning;_ it is the lending of a name, an authority, or an influence, in order to strengthen and confirm the thing: there is most of assistance and co-operation in _support;_ it is the employment of means to an end. Superiors only can _countenance_ or _sanction;_ persons in all conditions may _support:_ those who _countenance_ evil-doers give a _sanction_ to their evil deeds; those who _support_ either an individual or a cause ought to be satisfied that they are entitled to _support._

####counterpoise 
**COUNTERPOISE, BALANCE, POISE, WEIGH.**  
These terms all indicate methods of _weighing. Counterpoise_ is derived from Latin _contra_, against, and _pensare_, to weigh, and signifies to _weigh_ one thing against another. _Poise_ is derived from _pensare_, also; it signifies to weigh, and refers especially to the adjusting of one part of a balance to the other. _Balance_ comes through Italian from _bilanx_, Latin, from _bis_, double, and _lanx_, a dish or platter, and refers to a pair of scales with two plates suspended from a cross-bar. _Weigh_, Anglo-Saxon _wegan_, to carry or bear, meant at first to move in any direction; then to lift up, then to lift up two things, _balancing_ one against the other. Hence these words have practically the same meaning, but differ in the vividness with which they suggest the actual performance of weighing — _balance_ and _counterpoise_ being more suggestive in this respect than _poise_ and _weigh._ The substantives corresponding to these words have figurative meanings which differ somewhat more vividly. _Poise_ and _balance_ are both applied to a kind of self-control, which enables its possessor to remain quiet and reasonable, and uninfluenced either by outward events or violent emotion. _Poise_, in this sense, is a general attribute; _balance_ is applied to specific cases in which _poise_ has been displayed. We say that a lady has _poise_, meaning that she is almost uniformly unruffled and self-controlled — that she resembles a pair of scales in which the weight on one side exactly corresponds to the weight on the other. We say that a man kept his _balance_, when we mean that in a particular instance he did not let himself be absolutely controlled by only one feeling or one consideration. _Weight_ has a figurative meaning of another sort; it corresponds to heaviness, and signifies that which _weighs_ heavily. A man of _weight_ is a man who can bring much force or influence to bear upon a situation.

####countryman 
**COUNTRYMAN, PEASANT, SWAIN, HIND, RUSTIC, CLOWN.**  
_Countryman_, that is, a man of the country, or one belonging to the _country_, is the general term applicable to all inhabiting the _country_, in distinction from a townsman. _Peasant_, from Old French _pais_ (French _pays)_, the country, signified originally the inhabitant of a _pagus_ (Latin) village — _pagus_ being the word whence _pagan is_ also derived. _Peasant_ is employed in the same sense for any _countryman_ among the inhabitants of the Continent, and is in consequence used in poetry or the grave style for a _countryman. Swain_, in Anglo-Saxon _swan_, signified literally a _swineherd_, but it has acquired, from its use in poetry, the higher signification of a shepherd, or husbandman. _Hind_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _hina_, a domestic, and _hiwen_, a family; compare the relation of Latin _famulus_, servant, to the word _family._ It signified a servant in the household. _Rustic_, from _rus_, the country, signifies one born and bred in the country. _Clown_ is a Scandinavian word meaning a clumsy, boorish fellow, allied to _clump._  
All these terms are employed as epithets to persons, and principally to such as live in the _country:_ the terms _countryman_ and _peasant_ are taken in an indifferent sense, and may comprehend persons of different descriptions; they designate nothing more than habitual residence in the _country:_ the other terms are employed for the lower orders of _countrymen_, but with collateral ideas favorable or unfavorable annexed to them: _swain, hind_, both convey the idea of innocence in a humble station, and are therefore always employed in poetry in a good sense: the _rustic_ and _clown_ both convey the idea of that uncouth rudeness and ignorance which is in reality found among the lowest orders of _countrymen._

####couple 
**COUPLE, PAIR, BRACE.**  
_Couple_ comes from Latin _con_, together, and Old Latin _apere_, to join, preserved in _aptus_, English _apt._ It signifies things joined together; and as two things are with most convenience bound together, it has by custom been confined to this number. _Pair_, in French _paire_, Latin _par_, equal, signifies things that are equal, which can with propriety be said only of two things with regard to each other. _Brace_, from the French _bras_, arm, signifies things locked together after the manner of the folded arms, which on that account are confined to the number of two.  
From the above illustration of these terms, it is clear that the number of two, which is included in all of them, is, with regard to the first, entirely arbitrary; that with regard to the second it arises from the nature of the junction; and with regard to the third it arises altogether from the nature of the objects; _couples_ and _braces_ are made by _coupling_ and _bracing; pairs_ are either so of themselves or are made so by others: _couples_ and _braces_ always require a junction in order to make them complete; _pairs_ require similarity only to make them what they are: _couples_ are joined by a foreign tie; even the being in company is sufficient to make a _couple; braces_ are produced by a close junction, or what is supposed to be so, which requires them to go together. _Couple_ is applied to objects generally.  
_Pair_ is applied to things that naturally go in _pairs. Brace_ is applied to particular things, either themselves joined together or serving to join others together; as birds that are shot and are usually linked together are termed a _brace;_ whence in poetry the term is applied to animals or other objects in a close state of junction.  
_Couple_ is applied to persons of different sex who are bound to each other by the ties of affection or by the marriage tie.  
_Pair_ is also applied to persons similarly situated, but refers more to the moral tie from similarity of feeling: whence the newly married _couple_ is in ordinary discourse called the happy _pair. Pair_ is applied to persons in no other connection, and _brace_ never except in the burlesque style. 

####courage 
**COURAGE, FORTITUDE, RESOLUTION.**  
_Courage_ (see **bravery** under [brave](entry://brave)). _Fortitude_, in French _fortitude_, Latin _fortitude_, is the abstract noun from _fortis_, strong. _Resolution_, from Latin _re_, again, and _solvere_, to loose, signifies to divide something into its component parts; hence to decide; and marks the act of _resolving_, or the state of being _resolved. Courage_ respects action, _fortitude_ respects passion: a man has _courage_ to meet danger, and _fortitude_ to endure pain. _Courage_ is that power of the mind which bears up against the evil that is in prospect; _fortitude_ is that power which endures the pain that is felt: the man of _courage_ goes with the same coolness to the mouth of the cannon as the man of _fortitude_ undergoes the amputation of a limb. Horatius Codes displayed his _courage_ in defending a bridge against the whole army of the Etruscans: Caius Mutius displayed no less _fortitude_ when he thrust his hand into the fire in the presence of King Porsena, and awed him as much by his language as his action.  
_Courage_ seems to be more of a manly virtue; _fortitude_ is more distinguishable as a feminine virtue: the former is at least most adapted to the male sex who are called upon to act, and the latter to the females, who are obliged to endure: a man without _courage_ would be as ill prepared to discharge his duty in his intercourse with the world as a woman without _fortitude_ would be to support herself under the complicated trials of body and mind with which she is liable to be assailed.  
_Resolution_ is a minor species of _courage_, or it is _courage_ in the minor concerns of life: _courage_ comprehends under it a spirit to advance; _resolution_ simply marks the will not to recede: we require _courage_ to bear down all the obstacles which oppose themselves to us; we require _resolution_ not to yield to the first difficulties that offer. 

####course 
**COURSE, RACE, PASSAGE.**  
_Course_, from _currere_, to run, signifies either the act of running or the space run over. _Race_ comes from Scandinavian _ras_, a running, and signifies the same act. _Passage_, Latin _passus_, a step, signifies either the act of stepping, or the space passed over.  
_Course_ and _race_ as acts imply the act of walking or running; _passage_, the act of passing or going generally: as swift in the _course_, to win the _race_, to be lost in the _passage._ The _course_ in this case may be the act of one alone; the _race_ is always the act of one in competition with others.  
In the sense of the space gone over _course_ is to be compared with _passage_ in the proper application, and with _race_ in the improper. The _course_ is the direction taken or chosen by any object, and applies to persons or things personified; as a person pursues a _course. Passage_ is the way either through or over an object, and applies only to inanimate objects.  
_Course_, in the moral application, signifies the direction taken in the business of life; as to pursue a right or wrong _course._  
The _race_ is that course of life which a person is supposed to run with others toward a certain object, it is used mostly in the spiritual sense.

####court 
See [homage](entry://homage); [tribunal](entry://tribunal)

####courteous 
**COURTEOUS, COMPLAISANT, COURTLY.**  
_Courteous_, from _court_, denotes properly belonging to a _court_, and, by a natural extension of the sense, suitable to a _court. Complaisant_ (see [complaisance](entry://complaisance)).  
_Courteous_ in one respect comprehends in it more than _complaisant;_ it includes the manner as well as the action; it is, properly speaking, polished _complaisance:_ on the other hand, _complaisance_ includes more of the disposition in it than _courteousness;_ it has less of the polish, but more of the reality of kindness. _Courteousness_ displays itself in the address and manners; _complaisance_, in direct good offices: _courteousness_ is practised between strangers; _complaisance_, among friends.  
See also [affable](entry://affable); [well-bred](entry://well-bred)  
_Courtly_, though derived from the same word as _courteous_, is in some degree opposed to it in point of sense; it denotes a likeness to a _court_, but not a likeness which is favorable: _courtly_ is to _courteous_ as the form to the reality; the _courtly_ consists of the exterior only, the latter of the exterior combined with the spirit; the former, therefore, seems to convey the idea of insincerity when contrasted with the latter, which must necessarily suppose the contrary: a _courtly_ demeanor, or a courtier-like demeanor, may be suitable on certain occasions; but a _courteous_ demeanor is always desirable.  
_Courtly_ may likewise be employed in relation to things, as belonging to a _court;_ but _courteous_ has always respect to persons: we may speak of a _courtly_ style, or _courtly_ grandeur; but we always speak of _courteous_ behavior, _courteous_ language, and the like. 

####covenant 
See [agreement](entry://agreement)

####cover 
**COVER, HIDE.**  
_Cover_, in French _couvrir_, Italian _coprire_, Latin _cooperio_, is compounded of _con_, intensive, and _operio_, to conceal, and signifies to conceal thoroughly. _Hide_ (see [conceal](entry://conceal)).  
_Cover_ is to _hide_ as the means to the end: we commonly _hide_ by _covering;_ but we may easily _cover_ without _hiding_, as also _hide_ without _covering._ The ruling idea in the word _cover_ is that of throwing or putting something over a body: in the word _hide_ is that of keeping carefully to one's self, from the observation of others. In most civilized countries it is common to _cover_ the head: in the Eastern countries females commonly wear veils to _hide_ the face.  
_Cover_ sometimes, particularly in the moral application, signifies to conceal; but in that case it denotes the manner of concealing, namely, by overspreading; but _hide_ denotes either the intention or desire to conceal or the concealing what ought not to be seen.  
**COVER, SHELTER, SCREEN.** — _Cover_ properly denotes what serves as a _cover_, in the literal sense of the verb from which it is derived (see above). _Shelter_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _scild-truma_, literally _shield-troop_, a band of men with shields set to guard a place; hence any protection. _Screen_ is derived through French from Teutonic _schranne_, a railing or a grate.  
_Cover_ is literally applied to many particular things which are employed in _covering;_ but in the general sense which makes it analogous to the other terms it includes the idea of concealing: _shelter_ comprehends that of protecting from some immediate or impending evil: _screen_ includes that of warding off some trouble. A _cover_ always supposes something which can extend over the whole surface of a body; a _shelter_ or a _screen_ may merely interpose to a sufficient extent to serve the intended purpose. Military operations are sometimes carried on under _cover_ of the night; a bay is a convenient _shelter_ for vessels against the violence of the winds; a chair may be used as a _screen to_ prevent the violent action of the heat or the external air.  
In the moral sense, a fair reputation is sometimes made the _cover_ for the commission of gross irregularities in secret. When a person feels himself unable to withstand the attacks of his enemies, he seeks a _shelter_ under the sanction and authority of a great name. Bad men sometimes use wealth and power to _screen_ them from the punishment which is due to their offences.

####covetousness 
**COVETOUSNESS, CUPIDITY, AVARICE.**  
_Covetousness_, from _covet_, and Latin _cupere_, to desire, signifies having a desire. _Cupidity_ is a more immediate derivative from the Latin, signifying the same thing. _Avarice_ (see [avaricious](entry://avaricious)).  
All these terms are employed to express an illicit desire after objects of gratification; but _covetousness_ is applied to property in general, or to whatever is valuable; _cupidity_ and _avarice_, only to money or possessions. A child may display its _covetousness_ in regard to the playthings which fall in its way; a man shows his _cupidity_ in regard to the gains that fall in his way; we should, therefore, be careful to check a _covetous_ disposition in early life, lest it show itself in the more hateful character of _cupidity_ in advanced years. _Covetousness_ is the natural disposition for having or getting; _cupidity_ is the acquired disposition. As the love of appropriation is an innate characteristic in man, that of accumulating or wanting to accumulate, which constitutes _covetousness_, will show itself, in some persons, among the first indications of character: where the prospect of amassing great wealth is set before a man, as in the case of a governor of a distant province, it will evince great virtue in him if his _cupidity_ be not excited. The _covetous_ man seeks to add to what he has; the _avaricious_ man only strives to retain what he has: the _covetous_ man sacrifices others to indulge himself; the _avaricious_ man will sometimes sacrifice himself to indulge others; for generosity, which is opposed to _covetousness_, is sometimes associated with _avarice._

####credit 
**CREDIT, FAVOR, INFLUENCE.**  
_Credit_, from the Latin _creditus_, participle of _credere_, to believe or trust, marks the state of being believed or trusted. _Favor_, from the Latin _favere_, to befriend or please, marks an agreeable or pleasant state of feeling toward an object. _Influence_, in French _influence_, Latin _influentia_, from _in_, in, and _fluere_, to flow, marks the state or power of acting upon any object so as to direct or move it.  
These terms mark the state we stand in with regard to others as flowing out of their sentiments toward ourselves: _credit_ arises out of esteem: _favor_, out of good-will or affection; _influence_, out of either _credit_ or _favor_, or external circumstances: _credit_ depends altogether on personal merit, real or supposed; _favor_ may depend on the caprice of him who bestows it. The _credit_ which we have with others is marked by their confidence in our judgment; by their disposition to submit to our decisions; by their reliance on our veracity or assent to our opinions: the _favor_ we have with others is marked by their readiness to comply with our wishes, their subserviency to our views, attachment to our society: men of _talent_ are ambitious to gain _credit_ with their sovereigns by the superiority of their counsel: weak men or men of ordinary powers are contented with being the _favorites_ of princes and enjoying their patronage and protection. _Credit_ redounds to the honor of the individual, and stimulates him to noble exertions; it is beneficial in its results to all mankind, individually or collectively: _favor_ redounds to the personal advantage, the selfish gratification of the individual; it is apt to inflame pride and provoke jealousy.  
_Credit_ and _favor_ are the gifts of others; _influence_ is a possession which we derive from circumstances: there will always be _influence_ where there is _credit_ or _favor_, but it may exist independently of either: we have _credit_ and _favor_ for ourselves; we exert _influence_ over others: _credit_ and _favor_ serve one's own purposes; _influence_ is employed in directing others: weak people easily give their _credit_, or bestow their _favor_, by which an _influence_ is gained over them to bend them to the will of others; the _influence_ itself may be good or bad, according to the views of the person by whom it is exerted.

**CREMATION, INCINERATION.**  
_Cremation_, in Latin _crematio_ through _crematus_ from _cremare_, to burn, and _incineration_, in Low Latin _incineratio_ from _incinerare_, to reduce to ashes, both refer to the method of disposing of the dead by burning, instead of earth burial. _Cremation_ is the more common term in the United States. 

####crew 
See [band](entry://band)

####crime 
**CRIME, VICE, SIN.**  
_Crime_, in Latin _crimen_, Greek _κρίνειν_, to judge, signifies a sentence, or punishment; and also the cause of the sentence or punishment, in which latter sense it is here taken. _Vice_, in Latin _vitium_, a blemish, signifies that which destroys the perfection of something. _Sin_, Anglo-Saxon _synn_, is allied to one form of the verb _to be_ (Latin _sum, sunt_, etc.). "Language regards the guilty man as _the man who it was"_ (CuRTIUS).  
A _crime_ is a social offence; a _vice_ is a personal offence: every action which does injury to others, either individually or collectively, is a _crime;_ that which does injury to ourselves is a _vice. Crime_ consists in a violation of human laws; _vice_, in a violation of the moral law; _sin_, in a violation of the divine law: _sin_, therefore, comprehends both _crime_ and _vice;_ but there are many _sins_ which are not _crimes_ nor _vices: crimes_ are tried before a human court, and punished agreeably to the sentence of the judge; _vices_ and _sins_ are brought before the tribunal of the conscience; the former are punished in this world, the latter will be punished in the world to come, by the sentence of the Almighty: treason is one of the most atrocious _crimes;_ drunkenness one of the most dreadful _vices;_ religious hypocrisy one of the most heinous _sins._  
**CRIME, MISDEMEANOR.** — _Crime_ (see above). _Misdemeanor_ signifies literally a wrong demeanor.  
The former of these terms is to the latter as the genus to the species: a _misdemeanor_ is in the technical sense a minor _crime._ Housebreaking is under all circumstances a _crime;_ but shoplifting or pilfering amounts only to a _misdemeanor._ Corporal punishments are most commonly annexed to _crimes;_ pecuniary punishments frequently to _misdemeanors._ In the vulgar use of these terms, _misdemeanor_ is moreover distinguished from _crime_ by not always signifying a violation of public law, but only of private morals; in which sense the former term implies what is done against the state, and the latter that which offends individuals or small communities.  
**CRIMINAL, GUILTY.** — _Criminal_, from _crime_, signifies belonging or relating to a _crime. Guilty_, from _guilt_ (in Anglo-Saxon _gylt_, a trespass and a fine for trespass, possibly allied to _geldan_, to pay, whence our word _yield_ is derived), signifies having _guilt. Criminal_ respects the character of the offence; _guilty_ respects the fact of committing the offence. The _criminality_ of a person is estimated by all the circumstances of his conduct which present themselves to observation; his _guilt_ requires to be proved by evidence. The _criminality_ is not a matter of inquiry, but of judgment; the _guilt_ is often doubtful, if not positively concealed. The higher the rank of a person the greater his _criminality_ if he does not observe an upright and irreproachable conduct: where a number of individuals are concerned in any unlawful proceeding, the difficulty of attaching the _guilt_ to the real offender is greatly increased.  
_Criminal_ may be applied as an epithet either to the person or that which is personal: _guilty_ is properly applied only to the person: a person, or his actions, looks, thought, intentions, may be _criminal:_ the person himself is _guilty_ of whatever he actually commits. What is _criminal_ is against good morals; but a person may be _guilty_ of trivial errors in indifferent matters.  
**CRIMINAL, CULPRIT, MALEFACTOR, FELON, CONVICT.** — All these terms are employed for a public offender; but the first conveys no more than this general idea; while the others comprehend some accessory idea in their signification. _Criminal_ is a general term, and the rest are properly species of _criminals. Culprit_ comes from Anglo-French _cul_ (for Latin _culpa_, fault) and _prest_, ready to prove it, signifying that the clerk of the crown was ready to prove the indictment. _Malefactor_, compounded of the Latin terms _male_ and _factor_, signifies an evil-doer — that is, one who does evil, in distinction from him who does good. _Felon_ is derived from Late Latin _felonem_ (accusative), a traitor, allied to _fell_, meaning cruel, dire. _Convict_, in Latin _convictus_, participle of _convince_, to convince or prove, signifies one proved or found guilty.  
When we wish to speak in general of those who by offences against the laws or regulations of society have exposed themselves to punishment, we denominate them _criminals:_ when we consider them as already brought before a tribunal, we call them _culprits:_ when we consider them in regard to the moral turpitude of their character, as the promoters of evil rather than of good, we entitle them _malefactors:_ when we consider them as offending by the grosser violations of the law, they are termed _felons:_ when we consider them as already under the sentence of the law, we denominate them _convicts._ The punishments inflicted on _criminals_ vary according to the nature of their crimes and the spirit of the laws by which they are judged: a guilty conscience will give a man the air of a _culprit_ in the presence of those who have no authority to be either his accusers or judges; it gratified the malice of the Jews to cause our blessed Saviour to be crucified between two _malefactors:_ it is an important regulation in the internal economy of a prison to have _felons_ kept distinct from one another, particularly if their crimes are of an atrocious nature: it has not unfrequently happened that, when the sentence of the law has placed _convicts_ in the lowest state of degradation, their characters have undergone so entire a reformation as to enable them to attain a higher pitch of elevation than they had ever enjoyed before.

####criterion 
**CRITERION, STANDARD.**  
_Criterion_, in Greek _κριτήριον_, from _κρίνειν_, to judge, signifies the mark or rule by which one may judge. _Standard_ signified originally an ensign, a flag fixed on a large standing-pole, and is derived from _extendere_, to extend, though influenced by the verb _stand._ The pole bearing the flag came to indicate a standard of measurement, symbolizing the ideals of the people whom it represented, and the action expected of them.  
The _criterion_ is employed only in matters of judgment; the _standard_ is used in the ordinary concerns of life. The former serves for determining the characters and qualities of things; the latter for defining quantity and measure. The language and manners of a person are the best _criterion_ for forming an estimate of his station and education. In order to produce a uniformity in the mercantile transactions of mankind one with another, it is the custom of governments to fix a certain _standard_ for the regulation of coins, weights, and measures.  
The word _standard_ may likewise be used figuratively in the same sense. The Bible is a _standard_ of excellence, both in morals and religion, which cannot be too closely followed. It is impossible to have the same _standard_ in the arts and sciences, because all our performances fall short of perfection and will admit of improvement.

####critical 
**CRITICAL, CRUCIAL, IMPORTANT, VITAL.**  
These words all suggest a state of uncertainty, or something necessary to decide the welfare or success of a person or a project. _Critical_, from the Greek _κρίνειν_, to judge, and _crucial_, from Latin _crux_, a cross, referring to the cross placed at the fork in a road to point the way, have a similar meaning. A _critical_ moment is a moment in which the decision hangs in the balance. A _crucial_ instance is the instance on which the decision depends. The use of _crucial_ is partly influenced by its relation to _crux_, which also suggests an instrument of torture — so that the word has a certain intensity of meaning that; _critical_ does not have. It has also a more limited and specific application. _Important_, from _in_, in, and _portare, to_ bring, is a more general word. It signifies, literally, "bringing in" much, having weighty results; it does not suggest the making of a decision. _Vital_ (from _vita_, life) means essential to the life of something.

####cruel 
**CRUEL, INHUMAN, BARBAROUS, BRUTAL, SAVAGE.**  
_Cruel_, from the Latin _crudelis_ and _crudus_, raw, rough, or untutored; _inhuman_, compounded of the privative _in_ and _human_, signifying not human; _barbarous_, from the Greek _βάρβαρος_, foreigner, in imitation of the sound of a strange language — "bar, bar" — all these mark a degree of bad feeling which is uncontrolled by culture or refinement. _Brutal_, signifying like the _brute_ (see [animal](entry://animal)), and _savage_, from Old French _salvage_, from Latin _silva_, woods, signifying a dweller in the woods — these mark a still stronger degree of this bad passion.  
_Cruel_ is the most familiar and the least powerful epithet of all these terms; it designates the ordinary propensity which, if not overpowered by a better principle, will invariably show itself by the desire of inflicting positive pain on others, or abridging their comfort: _inhuman_ and _barbarous_ are higher degrees of _cruelty; brutal_ and _savage_ rise so much in degree above the rest as almost to partake of another nature. A child gives early symptoms of his natural _cruelly_ by his ill-treatment of animals; but we do not speak of his _inhumanity_, because this is a term confined to men, and more properly to their treatment of their own species, although extended in its sense to their treatment of the _brutes: barbarity_ is but too common among children and persons of riper years. A person is _cruel_ who neglects the creature he should protect and take care of: he is _inhuman_ if he withhold from him the common marks of tenderness or kindness which are to be expected from one _human_ being to another; he is _barbarous_ if he find amusement in inflicting pain; he is _brutal_ or _savage_ according to the circumstances of aggravation which accompany the act of torturing.

####cry 
**CRY, WEEP.**  
An outward indication of pain is expressed by both these terms, but _cry_ (see [call](entry://call)) comprehends an audible expression accompanied with tears or otherwise. _Weep_, Anglo-Saxon _wepan_, signified originally to make an outcry; it now refers to the silent shedding of tears. _Crying_ arises from an impatience in suffering corporeal pains; children and weak people commonly _cry: weeping_ is occasioned by mental grief; the wisest and best of men will not disdain sometimes to _weep. Crying_ is as selfish as it is weak; it serves to relieve the pain of the individual to the annoyance of the hearer; _weeping_, when called forth by others sorrows, is an infirmity which no man could wish to be without: as an expression of generous sympathy, it affords essential relief to the sufferer.  
**CRY, SCREAM, SHRIEK.** — To _cry_ indicates the utterance of an articulate or an inarticulate sound. _Scream_ is a Scandinavian word meaning to _cry_ aloud. _Shriek_ is an imitative word, like _screech_, which tries to represent by its sound a certain kind of _cry. Crying_ is an ordinary mode of loud utterance resorted to on common occasions; one _cries_ in order to be heard: _screaming_ is an intemperate mode of _crying_, resorted to from an impatient desire to be heard or from a vehemence of feeling. People _scream_ to deaf people from the mistaken idea of making themselves heard; whereas a distinct articulation will always be more efficacious. It is frequently necessary to _cry_ when we cannot render ourselves audible by any other means; but it is never necessary nor proper to _scream. Shriek_ may be compared with _cry_ and _scream_ as expressions of pain; in this case to _shriek_ is more than to _cry_, and less than to _scream._ They both signify to _cry_ with a violent effort. We may _cry_ from the slightest pain or inconvenience; but one _shrieks_ or _screams_ only on occasions of great agony, either corporeal or mental. A child _cries_ when it has hurt its finger; it _shrieks_ in the moment of terror at the sight of a frightful object, or _screams_ until some one comes to its assistance.

####culpable 
**CULPABLE, FAULTY.**  
_Culpable_, in Latin _culpabilis_, comes from _culpa_, a fault or blame, signifying worthy of blame, fit to be blamed. _Faulty_, from _fault_, is ultimately derived from Latin _fallere_, to deceive.  
We are _culpable_ from the commission of one fault; we are _faulty_ from the number of _faults: culpable_ is a relative term; _faulty_ is absolute: we are _culpable_ with regard to a superior whose intentions we have not fulfilled; we are _faulty_ whenever we commit any _faults._ A master pronounces his servant as _culpable_ for not having attended to his commands; an indifferent person pronounces another as _faulty_ whose _faults_ have come under his notice. It is possible, therefore, to be _faulty_ without being _culpable_, but not _vice versa._

####cultivation 
**CULTIVATION, CULTURE, CIVILIZATION, REFINEMENT.**  
_Cultivation_ is derived from Latin _cultus_, from _colere_, to till, and denotes the act of _cultivating_, or state of being _cultivated. Culture_, from _cultus_, signifies the state only of being _cultivated. Civilization_ signifies the act of _civilizing_, or state of being _civilized_, from _civis_, a citizen, one who lives with others on comfortable terms in a city or state. _Refinement_ denotes the act of _refining_, or the state of being _refined. Cultivation_ is with more propriety applied to the thing that grows; _culture_ to that in which it grows. The _cultivation_ of flowers will not repay the labor unless the soil be prepared by proper _culture._ In the same manner, when speaking figuratively, we say the _cultivation_ of any art or science: the _cultivation_ of one's taste or inclination may be said to contribute to one's own skill or the perfection of the thing itself; but the mind requires _culture_ previously to this particular exertion of the powers.  
_Civilization_ is the first stage of _cultivation; refinement_ is the last; we _civilize_ savages by divesting them of their rudeness and giving them a knowledge of such arts as are requisite for _civil_ society; we _cultivate_ people in general by calling forth their powers into action and independent exertion; we _refine_ them by the introduction of the liberal arts. The introduction of Christianity has been the best means of _civilizing_ the rudest nations. The _cultivation_ of the mind in serious pursuits tends to refine the sentiments without debilitating the character; but the _cultivation_ of the liberal arts may be pursued to a vicious extent, so as to introduce an excessive _refinement_ of feeling that is incompatible with real manliness.  
**CULTIVATION, TILLAGE, HUSBANDRY.** — _Cultivation_ has a much more comprehensive meaning than either _tillage_ or _husbandry. Tillage_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _tilian_, to labor, from _til_, beneficial, and signifies to make land useful. It is a mode of _cultivation_ that extends no further than the preparation of the ground for the reception of the seed; _cultivation_ includes the whole process by which the produce of the earth is brought to maturity. We may _till_ without _cultivating;_ but we cannot _cultivate_, as far as respects the soil, without _tillage. Husbandry_ (see [husband](entry://husband)) is more extensive in its meaning than _tillage_, but not so extensive as _cultivation. Tillage_ respects the act only of _tilling_ the ground; _husbandry_ is employed for the office of _cultivating_ for domestic purposes. A _cultivator_ is a general term, defined only by the object that is _cultivated_, as the _cultivator_ of the grape or the olive; a _tiller_ is a laborer in the soil that performs the office for another: a _husbandman_ is a humble species of _cultivator_ who himself performs the whole office of _cultivating_ the ground for domestic purposes.

####cunning 
**CUNNING, CRAFTY, SUBTLE, SLY, WILY.**  
_Cunning_ (see [art](entry://art)). _Crafty_ signifies having _craft_, from Anglo-Saxon _craft_, German _kraft_, meaning power or energy, hence, specifically, power of mind; hence, in a still more specific sense, a particular kind of skill. (Compare the development of _keen_, from Anglo-Saxon _cene_, German _kuhn_, bold.) _Subtle_, in French _subtil_, and Latin _subtilis_, thin, from _sub_ and _tela_, a thread drawn to be fine; hence in the figurative sense in which it is here taken, fine or acute in thought. _Sly_ is a Scandinavian word originally meaning handy, dexterous, possibly allied to _slay. Wily_, full of wiles, may be derived from Anglo-Saxon _wiglian_, to practise sorcery.  
All these epithets agree in expressing an aptitude to employ peculiar and secret means to the attainment of an end; they differ principally in the secrecy of the means or the degree of circumvention that is employed. The _cunning_ man shows his dexterity simply in concealing; this requires little more than reservedness and taciturnity: the _crafty_ man goes further; he shapes his words and actions so as to lull suspicion; hence it is that a child may be _cunning_, but an old man will be _crafty:_ a _subtle_ man has more acuteness of invention than either, and all his schemes are hidden by a veil that is impenetrable to common observation: the _cunning_ man looks only to the concealment of an immediate object; the _crafty_ and _subtle_ man has a remote object to conceal: thus men are _cunning_ in their ordinary concerns; politicians are _crafty_ or _subtle:_ but the former are more so as to the end, and the latter as to the means. A man is _cunning_ and _crafty_ by deeds; he is _subtle_ mostly by means of words alone, or words and actions combined. _Slyness_ is a vulgar kind of _cunning;_ the _sly_ man goes cautiously and silently to work. _Wiliness_ is a species of _cunning_ or _craft_, applicable only to cases of attack or defence.

####cure 
**CURE, HEAL, REMEDY.**  
_Cure_, in Latin _euro_, signifies to take care of, that is, by distinction, to take care of that which requires particular care, in order to remove an evil. _Heal_ signifies to make whole that which is unsound. _Remedy_, in Latin _remedium_, is compounded of _re_ and _medere_, to heal. The particle _re_ is here an intensive.  
To _cure_ is employed for what is out of order; to _heal_, for that which is broken: diseases are _cured_, wounds are _healed;_ the former is a complex, the latter is a simple process. Whatever requires to be _cured_ is wrong in the system; it requires many and various applications internally and externally: whatever requires to be _healed_ is occasioned externally by violence, and requires external applications. In a state of refinement men have the greatest number of disorders to be _cured;_ in a savage state there is more occasion for the _healing_ art.  
_Cure_ is used as properly in the moral as the natural sense; _heal_ in the moral sense is altogether figurative. The disorders of the mind are _cured_ with greater difficulty than those of the body. The breaches which have been made in the affections of relatives toward each other can be _healed_ by nothing but a Christian spirit of forbearance and forgiveness.  
To _remedy_, in the sense of applying _remedies_, has a moral application, in which it accords most with _cure._ Evils are either _cured_ or _remedied_, but the former are of a much more serious nature than the latter. The evils in society require to be _cured;_ an omission, a deficiency, or a mischief requires to be _remedied._ When bad habits become inveterate, they are put out of the reach of _cure._ It is an exercise for the ingenuity of man to attempt to _remedy_ the various troubles and inconveniences which are daily occurring.  
**CURE, REMEDY.** — _Cure_ denotes either the act of _curing_ or the thing that _cures. Remedy_ is mostly employed for the thing that _remedies._ In the former sense the _remedy_ is to the _cure_ as the means to the end; a _cure_ is performed by the application of a _remedy._ That is _incurable_ for which no _remedy_ can be found; but a _cure_ is sometimes performed without the application of any specific _remedy._ The _cure_ is complete when the evil is entirely removed; the _remedy_ is sure which by proper application never fails of effecting the _cure._ The _cure_ of disorders depends upon the skill of the physician and the state of the patient; the efficacy of _remedies_ depends upon their suitable choice and application: but a _cure_ may be defeated, or a _remedy_ made of no avail, by a variety of circumstances independent of either.  
A _cure_ is sometimes employed for the thing that _cures_, which brings it nearer in sense to the word _remedy_, the former being applied to great matters, the latter to small. Quacks always hold forth their nostrums as infallible _cures_, not for one, but for every sort of disorder; experience has, however, fatally proved that the _remedy_ in most cases is worse than the disease. 

####curing

####curious 
**CURIOUS, INQUISITIVE, PRYING.**  
_Curious_, in French _curieux_, Latin _curiosus_, from _cura_, care, signifying full of care. _Inquisitive_, in Latin _inquisitus_, from _inquirere_, to inquire or search into, signifies a disposition to investigate thoroughly. _Prying_, from _pry_, is derived from Old French _prier_, to pillage, from Late Latin _predare_, to prey upon, hence to search out prey, or simply to search out.  
The disposition to interest one's self in matters not of immediate concern is the idea common to all these terms. _Curiosity_ is directed to all objects that can gratify the inclination, taste, or understanding; _inquisitiveness_, to such things only as satisfy the understanding. The _curious_ person interests himself in all the works of nature and art; he is _curious_ to try effects and examine causes: the _inquisitive_ person endeavors to add to his store of knowledge. _Curiosity_ employs every means which falls in its way in order to procure gratification; the _curious_ man uses his own powers or those of others to serve his purpose: _inquisitiveness_ is indulged only by means of verbal inquiry; the _inquisitive_ person collects all from others. A traveller is _curious_ who examines everything for himself; he is _inquisitive_ when he minutely questions others. _Inquisitiveness_ is therefore to _curiosity_ as a means to an end; whoever is _curious_ will naturally be _inquisitive_, but he who is _inquisitive_ may be so either from _curiosity_ or from other motives.  
_Curious_ and _inquisitive_ may both be used in a bad. sense; _prying_ is never used otherwise than in a bad sense. _Inquisitive_, as in the former case, is a mode of _curiosity_, and _prying_ is a species of eager _curiosity._ A _curious_ person takes unallowed means of learning that which he ought not to wish to know; an _inquisitive_ person puts many impertinent and troublesome questions: a _prying_ temper is unceasing in its endeavors to get acquainted with the secrets of others. _Curiosity_ is a fault most frequent among females; _inquisitiveness_ is most general among children; a _prying_ temper belongs only to people of low character. A well-disciplined mind checks the first risings of idle _curiosity:_ children should be taught early to suppress an _inquisitive_ temper, which may so easily become burdensome to others: those who are of a _prying_ temper are insensible to everything but the desire of unveiling what lies hidden; such a disposition is often engendered by the unlicensed indulgence of _curiosity_ in early life, which becomes a sort of passion in riper years.

####cursory 
**CURSORY, HASTY, SLIGHT, DESULTORY.**  
_Cursory_, from the Latin _curro_, signifies run over or done in running. _Hasty_ signifies done in _haste_, from Anglo-Saxon _hœst_, violence. _Slight_ meant originally even or flat; then plain, smooth, simple, trivial. _Desultory_, from _desilo_, to leap, signifies leaped over.  
_Cursory_ includes both _hasty_ and _slight;_ it includes _hasty_ inasmuch as it expresses a quick motion; it includes _slight_ inasmuch as it conveys the idea of a partial action: a view may be either _cursory_ or _hasty_, as the former is taken by design, the latter from carelessness: a view may be either _cursory_ or _slight;_ but the former is not so imperfect as the latter: an author will take a _cursory_ view of those points which are not necessarily connected with his subject; an author who takes a _hasty_ view of a subject will mislead by his errors; he who takes a _slight_ view will disappoint by the shallowness of his information. Between _cursory_ and _desultory_ there is the same difference as between running and leaping: we run in a line, but we leap from one part to another; so remarks that are _cursory_ have still more or less connection, but remarks that are _desultory_ are without any coherence.

####custom 
**CUSTOM, HABIT.**  
_Custom_, in Trench _coûtume_, from Latin _consuecudinem_, based on Latin _consuetum_, participle of _consuescere_, to accustom. _Habit_, in French _habit_, Latin _habitudo_, from _habere_, to have, marks the state of having or holding.  
_Custom_ is a frequent repetition of the same act; _habit_, the effect of such repetition: the _custom_ of rising early in the morning is conducive to the health, and may in a short time become such a _habit_ as to render it no less agreeable than it is useful. _Custom_ supposes an act of the will; _habit_ implies an involuntary movement: _custom_ is followed; a _habit_ is acquired.  
_Custom_ is applicable to bodies of men; _habit_ is confined to the individual; every nation has _customs_ peculiar to itself; and every individual has _habits_ peculiar to his age, station, and circumstances.  
_Customary_ and _habitual_, the epithets derived from these words admit of a similar distinction: the _customary_ action is that which is repeated after the manner of a _custom;_ the _habitual_ action is that which is done by the force of _habit._  
See also [tax](entry://tax); [usage](entry://usage)  
**CUSTOM, FASHION, MANNER, PRACTICE.** — _Customs, fashions_, and _manners_ are all employed for communities of men; _custom_ respects established and general modes of action: _fashion_, in French _façon_, from _factio_, a making or doing, regards partial and transitory modes of making or doing things: _manner_, in the limited sense in which it is here taken, signifies the _manner_ or mode of men's living or behaving in their social intercourse.  
_Custom_ is authoritative; it stands in the place of law and regulates the conduct of men in the most important concerns of life: _fashion_ is arbitrary and capricious, it decides in matters of trifling import: _manners_ are rational; they are the expressions of moral feelings. _Customs_ have most force in a simple state of society; _fashions_ rule most where luxury has made the greatest progress; _manners_ are most distinguishable in a civilized state of society. _Customs_ are in their nature as unchangeable as _fashions_ are variable; _manners_ depend on cultivation and collateral circumstances; _customs_ die away or are abolished; _fashions_ pass away and new ones take their place; _manners_ are altered either for the better or the worse.  
_Practice_, in Latin _practica_, Greek _πρακτική_, from _πράσσειν_, to do, signifies actual doing or the thing done, that is, by distinction, the regularly doing, or the thing regularly done, in which sense it is most analogous to _custom;_ but the former simply conveys the idea of actual performance; the latter includes also the accessory idea of repetition at stated periods: a _practice_ may be defined as frequent or unfrequent, regular or irregular; but a _custom_ does not require to be qualified by any such epithets: it may be the _practice_ of a person to do acts of charity, as the occasion requires; but, when he uniformly does a particular act of charity at any given period of the year, it is properly denominated his _custom._  
Both _practice_ and _custom_ are general or particular, but the former is absolute, the latter relative: a _practice_ may be adopted by a number of persons without reference to one another; but a _custom_ is always followed either by imitation or prescription: the _practice_ of gaming has always been followed by the vicious part of society; but it is to be hoped for the honor of man that it will never become a _custom._

####cycle 
**CYCLE, BICYCLE, TRICYCLE, HYDROCYCLE, MOTORCYCLE, TANDEM, SOCIABLE.**  
_Cycle_, from the Greek _κύκλος_, a circle, in the sense of a vehicle, is a shortened term for a variety of constructions, outgrowths of the old French velocipede and dandy-horse of two and three wheels.  
The _bicycle_ and _tricycle_, as their names denote, are supplied with two and three wheels respectively; the _hydrocycle_ is an adaptation for use on a water surface; the _motorcycle_ is a bicycle propelled by an electric motor or other contrivance instead of by pedals on the front wheel, a form of cycle much used by the police; a _tandem_ has two wheels farther separated than the ordinary bicycle, with seats for two persons, one in the rear of the driver; and the _sociable_ is one of several names applied to a _tricycle_ having a more or less fancy rear seat for a second person, a form also used for light delivery vehicles.  
_Bike_ is a new slang term given by both professional and amateur wheelmen to their machines. 

####cynical

####dabble 
**DABBLE, DIP, SPLASH.**  
_Dabble_ exactly agrees in form and sense with Dutch _dabbelen. Dip_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _dyppan. Splash_ is formed by adding _s_, French _es_, Latin _ex_, to _plash_ (from a Teutonic root meaning to strike) for added emphasis. _Dip_ means to immerse in water and then to withdraw the immersed object quickly — indicating a light, decided, comparatively noiseless action. _Splash_ means to _dip_ in such a way as to fling the water about and make considerable noise. _Dabble_ means to keep _dipping lightly_, making each time a little _splash._ It indicates a purposeless action; _dip_ indicates an action not lacking in purpose, but in continuity and endurance. 

####daily 
**DAILY, DIURNAL.**  
_Daily_, from _day_ and _like_, signifies after the manner or in the time of the _day, day_ being derived from a Teutonic root signifying to burn, day being the bright, hot time, as opposed to night. _Diurnal_, from _dies_, day, signifies belonging to the _day. Daily_ is the colloquial term which is applicable to whatever passes in the _day-time; diurnal_ is the scientific term, which applies to what passes within or belongs to the astronomical _day:_ the physician makes _daily_ visits to his patients; the earth is said by astronomers to have a _diurnal_ motion on its own axis. 

####dainty 
**DAINTY, DELICACY.**  
These terms, which are in vogue among epicures, have some shades of difference not altogether undeserving of notice. _Dainty_, through French from Latin _dignitatem_, worthy, is applied to that which is of worth or value — of course only to such things as have a superior value in the estimation of epicures, and consequently conveys a more positive meaning than _delicacy;_ inasmuch as a _dainty_ may be that which is extremely _delicate_, a _delicacy_ is sometimes a species of _dainty;_ but there are many _delicacies_ which are altogether suited to the most _delicate_ appetite that are neither costly nor rare, two qualities which are almost inseparable from a _dainty:_ those who indulge themselves freely in _dainties_ and _delicacies_ scarcely know what it is to eat with an appetite; but those who are temperate in their use of the enjoyments of life will be enabled to derive pleasure from ordinary food. 

####dally 
**DALLY, TOY.**  
_Dally_ comes from Old French _dalier_, to converse, to pass one's time in light social converse. _Toy_ is derived from Dutch _tuig_, tools, utensils. A _toy_ is a device to give amusement, a plaything for children, especially. To _toy_ is to treat as a plaything — as a matter of no consequence; to amuse one's self as with a game. _Dally_ and _toy_ have substantially the same meaning, indicating frivolous or playful self-indulgence. Such difference as there is is that suggested by their derivation — _dally_ emphasizing a certain lightness and frivolousness, _toy_ a more positive playing with something. Both words are used to refer to amorous caresses with the slight difference in meaning above suggested. _Dally_ means also to delay, to put off by trifling, and _toy_ a purposeless handling, as when we say "He _toyed_ with his watch-chain. "

####danger 
**DANGER, PERIL, HAZARD.**  
_Danger_, Old French _dongier_, from Late Latin _dominum_, power, from Late Latin _domnus_, lord — one who has absolute authority. _Peril_ is derived from Latin _periculum_, from the verb _periri_, to try, Greek _πείρα_, an attempt. _Hazard_ (see [chance](entry://chance)).  
The idea of chance or uncertainty is common to all these terms; but the two former may sometimes be foreseen and calculated upon; the latter is purely contingent. _Dangers_ are far and near, ordinary and extraordinary: they meet us if we do not go in search of them; _perils_ are always distant and extraordinary: we must go out of our course to expose ourselves to them; in the quiet walk of life, as in the most busy and tumultuous, it is the lot of man to be surrounded by _danger;_ the mariner, and the traveller who goes in search of unknown countries, put themselves in the way of undergoing _perils_ both by sea and land.  
_Danger_ and _peril_ are applied to positive evils; _hazard_ respects the possibilities of good as well as of evil. When we are involved in _danger_ we are in a situation to lose what we wish to retain; when we run the _hazard_ of a battle we may either win or lose.  
The same distinction exists between the epithets that are derived from these terms.  
It is _dangerous_ for a youth to act without the advice of his friends; it is _perilous_ for a traveler to explore the wilds of Africa; it is _hazardous_ for a merchant to speculate in time of war: experiments in matters of policy or government are always _dangerous;_ a journey through deserts that are infested with beasts of prey is _perilous;_ a military expedition conducted with inadequate means is _hazardous._

####daring 
**DARING, BOLD.**  
_Daring_ signifies having the spirit to _dare. Bold_ (see [audacity](entry://audacity)).  
These terms may both be taken in a bad sense, but _daring_ much oftener than _bold;_ in either case _daring_ expresses much more than _bold:_ he who is _daring_ provokes resistance and courts _danger;_ but the _bold_ man is contented to overcome the resistance that is offered to him: a man may be _bold_ in the use of words only, he must be _daring_ in actions: he is _bold_ in the defence of truth; he is _daring_ in military enterprise.  
See also [stalwart](entry://stalwart)

####dark 
**DARK, OBSCURE, DIM, MYSTERIOUS.**  
_Dark_, Anglo-Saxon _deorc_, is connected with Old High German _tarchanjan_, to hide. _Obscure_ comes from Latin _obscurus_, from _ob_, over, and _scurus_, covered. _Dim_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _dim_, and is allied to Swedish _dimma_, a fog or haze.  
_Darkness_ expresses more than _obscurity;_ the former denotes the total privation of light; the latter only the diminution of light. _Dark_ is opposed to light; _obscure_ to bright; what is _dark_ is altogether hidden; what is_ obscure_ is not to be seen distinctly or without an effort.  
_Darkness_ may be used either in a natural or moral sense; _obscurity_ only in the latter; in which case the former conveys a more unfavorable idea: _darkness_ serves to cover that which ought not to be hidden; _obscurity_ intercepts our view of that which we would wish to see: the former is the consequence of design; the latter of neglect or accident: the letter sent by the conspirator in the gunpowder plot to his friend was _dark;_ all passages in ancient writers which allude to circumstances no longer known must necessarily be _obscure;_ a corner may be said to be _dark_ or _obscure_, but the former is used literally and the latter figuratively; the owl is obliged from the weakness of its visual organs to seek the _darkest_ corners in the daytime; men of distorted minds often seek _obscure_ corners only from disappointed ambition.  
_Dim_ expresses a degree of _darkness_, but it is employed more in relation to the person seeing than to the object seen. The eyes are said to grow _dim_, or the sight _dim._ The light is said to be _dim_ by which things are but _dimly_ seen.  
_Mysterious_ denotes a species of the _dark_, in relation to the actions of men; where a veil is intentionally thrown over any object so as to render it as incomprehensible as that which is sacred. _Dark_ is an epithet taken always in the bad sense, but _mysterious_ is always in an indifferent sense. We are told in the Sacred Writings that men love _darkness_ rather than light, because their deeds are evil. Whatever, therefore, is _dark_ in the ways of men is naturally presumed to be evil; but things may be _mysterious_ in the events of human life without the express intention of an individual to render them so. The speeches of an assassin and conspirator will be _dark;_ any intricate affair, which involves the characters and conduct of men may be _mysterious._ The same distinction exists between these terms when applied to the ways of Providence, which are said to be sometimes _dark_, inasmuch as they present a cloudy aspect; and mostly _mysterious_, inasmuch as they are past finding out.

####deadly 
**DEADLY, MORTAL, FATAL.**  
_Deadly_ or _dead-like_ signifies like death itself in its effects. _Mortal_, in Latin _mortalis_, signifies belonging to _death. Fatal_, in Latin _fatalis_, signifies according to _fate. Deadly_ is applied to what is productive of death; _mortal_ to what terminates in or is liable to death; _fatal_ applies not only to death, but everything which may be of great mischief. A poison is _deadly;_ a wound or a wounded part is _mortal;_ a step in walking, or a step in one's conduct, may be _fatal._ Things only are _deadly;_ creatures are _mortal._ Hatred is _deadly;_ whatever has life is _mortal._ There may be remedies sometimes to counteract that which is _deadly;_ but that which is _mortal_ is past all cure; and that which is _fatal_ cannot be retrieved. 

####deal 
**DEAL, QUANTITY, PORTION.**  
_Deal_, Anglo-Saxon _dœl_, a part, and German _theil_, from _dœlen, theilen_, etc., to divide, signifies literally the thing divided or taken off. _Quantity_, in Latin _guantitas_, comes from _quantus_, signifying how much. _Portion_ comes from Latin _portio_, allied to _parare_, to prepare, signifying a part prepared.  
_Deal_ always denotes something great, and cannot be coupled with any epithet that does not express much: _quantity_ is a term of relative import; it either marks indefinitely the how much or so much of a thing, or may be defined by some epithet to express much or little: _portion_ is of itself altogether indefinite, and admits of being qualified by any epithet to express much or little: _deal_ is a term confined to familiar use, and sometimes substituted for _quantity_, and sometimes for _portion._ It is common to speak of a _deal_ or a _quantity_ of paper, a great _deal_ or a great _quantity_ of money; likewise of a great _deal_ or a great _portion_ of pleasure, a great _deal_ or a great _portion_ of wealth: and in some cases _deal_ is more usual than either _quantity_ or _portion_, as a _deal_ of heat, a _deal_ of rain, a _deal_ of frost, a _deal_ of noise, and the like; but it is admissible only in the familiar style.  
_Portion_ is employed only for part of that which is detached from the whole; _quantity_ may sometimes be employed for a number of wholes. We may speak of a large or a small _quantity_ of books; a large or a small _quantity_ of plants or herbs; but a large or small _portion_ of food, a large or small _portion_ of color.  
**DEAL, ACT, BEHAVE, TRADE.** — In an extended sense, _deal_ relates to a business transaction, and also implies to _behave_ well or ill, to _act_ or practise, and one's conduct or behavior toward others. In business concerns a _deal_ may be an ordinary buying and selling of a commodity, more generally a bargain resulting from dickering between interested parties, a _trade_ or exchange of one commodity for another, or a transaction more or less discreditable to those engaged in it.  
As applied to persons, we have political _deals_, the trading of supposed or actual influence for votes, the disposition of a public measure according to the wishes of certain interested parties, as opposed to the authors and promoters of the measure, the sidetracking, pigeonholing, or defeat of a legislative bill as payment for services rendered in other directions, and the like. We say _deal gently with the erring_, meaning to _act_ kindly toward them; _that was an unfriendly deal_, a questionable, unfortunate, or indiscreet transaction; _to deal with_, to trade with or be a customer of another: _to deal by_, to treat well or ill; _to deal out_, to distribute or give in small quantities, doles; _to deal the cards_, to give each player the proper number; and _a great deal_, meaning very much, a large quantity.

####death 
**DEATH, DEPARTURE, DECEASE, DEMISE, PASSING OVER.**  
_Death_ signifies the act of _dying. Departure_ signifies the act of _departing. Decease_, from the Latin _de_, away, and _cedere_, to go, signifies the act of going away. _Demise_, from _demittere_, to lay down, signifies literally resigning possession. _Death_ is a general or a particular term; it marks, in the abstract sense, the extinction of life, and is applicable to men or animals, to one or many. _Departure, decease_, and _demise_ are particular expressions suited only to the condition of human beings. We speak of _death_ in reference to what happens before or at the time; we speak of the _death_ of men generally, or of the _death_ of individuals; we speak of the circumstances of _death_, its causes and effects. _Departure_ is a Christian term which carries with it an idea of a passage from one life to another. _Death_ of itself has always something terrific in it; but the Gospel has divested it of its terrors: the hour of _departure_, therefore, for a Christian, is often the happiest period of his mortal existence.  
_Decease_ presents only the idea of leaving life to the survivors. It is either a technical term in law for _death_ or it is used in common discourse for the falling off from the number of the living. Property is in perpetual occupancy; at the _decease_ of one possessor it passes into the hands of another. _Demise_ signifies properly a putting off, and in this acceptation the putting off of mortality; it is therefore appropriately used for princes, to denote that they at the same time put off or resign an earthly crown.  
As an epithet, _dead_ is used collectively; _departed_ is used with a noun only; _deceased_, generally without a noun, to denote one or more, according to the connection. There is a respect due to the _dead_ which cannot be violated without offence to the living. It is a pleasant reflection to conceive of _departed_ spirits as taking an interest in the concerns of those whom they have left. All the marks on the body of the _deceased_ indicated that he had met with his death by some violence.  
_Passing over_ is the term used by Christian Scientists for dying.

####debate 
**DEBATE, DELIBERATE.**  
These terms equally mark the acts of pausing or withholding the decision, whether applicable to one or many. To _debate_ (see [argue](entry://argue)) supposes always a contrariety of opinion; to _deliberate_ (see [consult](entry://consult)) supposes simply the weighing or estimating the value of the opinion that is offered. Where many persons have the liberty of offering their opinions, it is natural to expect that there will be _debating;_ when any subject offers that is complicated and questionable, it calls for mature _deliberation._ It is lamentable when passion gets such an ascendancy in the mind of any one as to make him _debate_ which course of conduct he shall pursue between virtue and vice; the want of _deliberation_, whether in private or public transactions, is a more fruitful source of mischief than almost any other. 

####debauch 
**DEBAUCH, SEDUCE, POLLUTE.**  
These words all indicate the act of enticing or corrupting, or both. _Debauch_ comes from French _débaucher_, to mar, seduce, mislead, probably of Teutonic origin. _Seduce_ comes from Latin se, apart, and _ducere_, to lead, and means to lead astray, to entice into reprehensible action. _Pollute_ comes from Old Latin _por_ or _pol_, toward, and _luere_, to wash, referring to the overflowing of a river; hence it came to mean to defile — as the washing over of the turbid flood destroys the cleanness and beauty of the shores. _Debauch_ is the strongest of these three words and the most specific in its application. It includes the idea of _seducing_ or leading astray and of _polluting_, and connotes unrestrained sensual indulgence. _Debauch_ has always a moral application; _pollute_ may have either a moral or physical application. _Seduce_ suggests trickery and persuasion in attaining an unhallowed end; _debauch_ suggests violence and moral ruin. 

####debilitate 
See **weaken** under [weak](entry://weak)

####debility 
**DEBILITY, INFIRMITY, IMBECILITY.**  
_Debility_ comes from Latin _debilis_, weak. _Infirmity_, in Latin _infirmitas_, from _infirmas_, or _in_, privative, and _firmus_, strong, signifies the absence of strength. _Imbecility_ comes from Latin _imbecilius_, weak.  
All these terms denote a species of weakness, but the former two, particularly the first, respect that which is either physical or mental. _Debility is_ constitutional or otherwise; _imbecility_ is always constitutional; _infirmity_ is accidental, and results from sickness or a decay of the frame. _Debility_ may be either general or local; _infirmity_ is always local; _imbecility_ always general. _Debility_ prevents the active performance of the ordinary functions of nature; it is a deficiency in the muscular power of the body: _infirmity_ is a partial want of power which interferes with, but does not necessarily destroy, the activity: _imbecility_ lies in the whole frame, and renders it almost entirely powerless. Young people are frequently troubled with _debilities_ in their ankles or legs, of which they are never cured. Old age is most exposed to _infirmities;_ but there is no age at which human beings are exempt from _infirmity_ of some kind or another. The _imbecility_ natural to youth, both in body and mind, would make them willing to rest on the strength of their elders if they were not too often misled by a mischievous confidence in their own strength. 

####debt 
**DEBT, DUE.**  
_Debt_ and _due_, in French _dû_, are both derived from the Latin _debere_, to owe. _Debt_ is used only as a substantive; _due_ either as a substantive or an adjective. As a substantive, _debt_ is commonly applied to that which is owing from the person spoken of; _due_ is always applied to that which is owing to the person: to pay one's _debts_, and receive one's _due._ So in the moral application to pay the _debt_ of nature, that is, what is _due_ or owing to nature; to give every man bis _due._

####decay 
**DECAY, DECLINE, CONSUMPTION.**  
_Decay_, in French _déchoir_, from the Latin _decado_, signifies literally to fall off or away. _Decline_, from the Latin _decline_, or _de_, away, and _clino_, a root meaning to lean, signifies to turn away or lean aside. The direction expressed by both these actions is very similar; it is a downward movement, but _decay_ expresses more than _decline._ What is _decayed_ is fallen or gone; what _declines_ leads toward a fall, or is going; when applied, therefore, to the same objects, a _decline is_ properly the commencement of a _decay._ The health may experience a _decline_ at any period of life from a variety of causes, but it naturally experiences a _decay_ in old age.  
_Consumption_, in general, implies a rapid decay. By _decay_ things lose their perfection, their greatness, and their consistency; by _decline_ they lose their strength, their vigor, and their lustre; by _consumption_ they lose their existence. _Decay_ brings to ruin; _decline_ leads to an end or expiration. There are some things to which _decay_ is peculiar, and some things to which _decline_ is peculiar, and other things to which both _decay_ and _decline_ belong. The corruption to which material substances are particularly exposed is termed _decay:_ the close of life, when health and strength begin to fall away, is termed the _decline:_ the _decay_, of states in the moral world takes place by the same process as the _decay_ of fabrics in the natural world; the _decline_ of empires, from their state of elevation and splendor, is a natural figure drawn from the _decline_ of the setting sun. _Consumption_ is seldom applied to anything but animal bodies except figuratively.

####deceit 
**DECEIT, DECEPTION.**  
_Deceit_ and _deception_ are both associated with the verb _deceive_, from, _decipere_, to take away, and both imply the act of deceiving; with this difference, that the _deceit_ is practised from an expressly bad motive, but _deception_ may be from either bad or indifferent motives. A person is therefore said to be guilty of _deceit_ who has sought to deceive another for his own purposes; but _deceptions_ may be practised in a diversity of ways, and from a diversity of motives.  
_Deceit is_ always a personal act, and if there be an habitual propensity to deceiving, the _deceit_ is then a characteristic of the person; a deceiver is full of _deceit. Deception_ frequently denotes the state of being deceived; it is the effect of any agency, whether from accident or from design. _Deceit_ is applied to cases where the understanding is intentionally deceived; but there may be a _deception_ on the senses as well as on the understanding.  
_Deceitful_ and _deceptive_ are employed with this distinction: a person is said to be _deceitful_, and a thing _deceptive._  
See also [sophistry](entry://sophistry) _Deceit, Duplicity, Double-dealing. — Deceit_ (see above). _Duplicity_ signifies _doubleness_ in dealing, the same as _double-dealing._ The former two may be applied either to habitual or particular actions, the latter only to particular actions. There may be much _deceit_ or _duplicity_ in a person's character or in his proceedings; there is _double-dealing_ only where dealing goes forward. The _deceit_ may be more or less veiled; the _duplicity_ lies very deep, and is always studied whenever it is put into practice. _Duplicity_, in reference to actions, is mostly employed for a course of conduct; _double-dealing_ is but another term for _duplicity_ on particular occasions. Children of reserved characters are frequently prone to _deceit_, which grows into consummate _duplicity_ in riper years: the wealthy are often exposed to much _duplicity_ when they choose their favorites among the low and ignorant.  
**DECEIT, FRAUD, GUILE.** — _Deceit_ is allied to _fraud_ in reference to actions; to _guile_ in reference to the character.  
_Deceit_ is here, as in the preceding article, indeterminate when compared with _fraud_, which is a specific mode of deceiving; _deceit_ is practised only in private transactions; _fraud_ is practised toward bodies as well as individuals, in public as well as private: a child practises _deceit_ toward its parents; _frauds_ are practised upon government, on the public at large, or on tradesmen: _deceit_ involves the violation of moral law, _fraud_ that of the criminal law. A servant may _deceive_ his master as to the time of his coming or going, but he _defrauds_ him of his property if he obtains it by any false means.  
_Deceit_ as a characteristic is indefinite in magnitude; _guile_ marks a strong degree of moral turpitude in the individual. The former is displayed in petty concerns: the latter, which contaminates the whole character, displays itself in inextricable windings and turnings that are suggested in a peculiar manner by the author of all evil. _Deceitful_ is an epithet commonly and lightly applied to persons in general; but _guileless_ is applied to characters which are the most diametrically opposed to, and at the greatest possible distance from, that which is false.

####deceive 
**DECEIVE, DELUDE, IMPOSE UPON.**  
_Deceive_, in French _décevoir_, Latin _decipere_, compounded of _de_, privative, and _capere_, to take, signifies to take wrong. _Delude_, in Latin _delude_, compounded of _de_ and _ludere_, signifies to play upon or to mislead by a trick. _Impose_ comes from Latin _in_, on, and French _poser_, from Latin _pausare._  
Falsehood is the leading feature in all these terms; they vary, however, in the circumstances of the action. To _deceive_ is the most general of the three; it signifies simply to produce a false conviction; the other terms are properly species of _deceiving_, including accessory ideas. _Deception_ may be practised in various degrees; _deluding_ is always something positive, and considerable in degree. Every false impression produced by external objects, whether in trifles or important matters, is a _deception;_ but _delusion_ is confined to errors in matters of opinion. We may be _deceived_ in the color or the distance of an object: we are _deluded_ in what regards our principles or moral conduct.  
A _deception_ does not always suppose a fault on the part of the person _deceived_, but a _delusion_ does. A person is sometimes _deceived_ in cases where _deception_ is unavoidable; he is _deluded_ through a voluntary blindness of the understanding: artful people are sometimes capable of _deceiving_ so as not even to excite suspicion; their plausible tales justify the credit that is given to them: when the ignorant enter into nice questions of politics or religion, it is their ordinary fate to be _deluded. Deception_ is practised by an individual on himself or others; a _delusion_ is commonly practised on one's self; an _imposition_ is always practised on another. Men _deceive_ others from a variety of motives; they always _impose upon_ them for purposes of gain or the gratification of ambition. Men _deceive_ themselves with false pretexts and false confidence; they _delude_ themselves with vain hopes and wishes.  
**DECEIVER, IMPOSTOR.** — Between the words _deceiver_ and _impostor_ there is a similar distinction. A _deceiver_ is any one who practises any sort of deception: but an _impostor_ is a _deceiver_ who studiously deceives by putting on a false appearance. The _deceiver_ practises _deception_ on individuals or the public; the _impostor_ most commonly on the public at large. The false friend and the faithless lover are _deceivers;_ the assumed nobleman who practises frauds under his disguise, and the pretended prince who lays claim to a crown to which he was never born, are _impostors._

####decency 
**DECENCY, DECORUM.**  
Though _decency_ and _decorum_ are both derived from the same word (see [becoming](entry://becoming)), they have acquired a distinction in their sense and application. _Decency_ respects a man's conduct; _decorum_ his behavior: a person conducts himself with _decency:_ he behaves with _decorum. Indecency_ is a vice; it is the violation of public or private morals: _indecorum_ is a fault; it offends the feelings of those who witness it. Nothing but a depraved mind can lead to _indecent_ practices; indiscretion and thoughtlessness may sometimes give rise to that which is _indecorous. Decency_ enjoins upon all relatives, according to the proximity of their relationship, to show certain marks of respect to the memory of the dead: regard for the feelings of others enjoins a certain outward _decorum_ upon every one who attends a funeral.

####decide 
**DECIDE, DETERMINE, CONCLUDE.**  
_Decide_, from the Latin _decido_, compounded of _de_, from, and _cœdere_, to cut, signifies to cut off or cut short a business. For the derivation of _determine_ see [arbitrate](entry://arbitrate). _Conclude_ (see [close](entry://close)).  
The idea of bringing a thing to an end is common in the signification of all these words; but to _decide_ expresses more promptitude than to _determine:_ we may _decide_ instantaneously, but we must take more or less time to _determine;_ we may _decide_ any single point either by an act of external force or by a sudden act of the mind; but, in _determining_ any question, its extent, limits, and every circumstance must be taken into consideration; _determining_ is therefore an act of deliberation. To _decide_ is an act of greater authority: a parent _decides_ for a child, but subordinates sometimes _determine_ in the absence of their employers. Points of law are _decided_ by the judge, points of fact are _determined_ by the jury. To _decide is_ therefore properly applied to all matters of dispute where more or less power or force is required to bring it to an end; to _determine, to_ all matters of conduct which may more easily be brought to an end.  
To _determine_ and _decide_ are applied to practical matters; to _conclude_ to speculative as well as practical matters, as to _decide_ the fate of persons, to _determine_ anything that interests one, to _conclude_ that a thing is, right or wrong, just or unjust, and the like.  
In respect to practical matters, to _determine_ is either said of that which is subordinate or it is a partial act of the mind; to _conclude_ is said of the grand result; it is a complete act at the mind. Many things may be _determined on_ which are either never put into execution or remain long unexecuted; but that which is _concluded on_ is mostly followed by immediate action. To _conclude_ is properly to come to a final _determination._   
**DECIDED, DETERMINED, RESOLUTE.** — A man who is _decided_ remains in no doubt: he who is _determined_ is uninfluenced by the doubts or questions of others: he who is _resolute_ (see [determined](entry://determined)) is uninfluenced by the consequences of his actions. A _decided_ character is at all times essential for a prince or a minister, but particularly so in an unsettled period; a _determined_ character is essential for a commander or any one who has to exercise authority; a _resolute_ character is essential for one who is engaged in dangerous enterprises. Pericles was a man of a _decided_ temper, which was well fitted to direct the affairs of government in a season of turbulence and disquietude: Titus Manlius Torquatus displayed himself to be a man of a _determined_ character when he put to death his victorious son for a breach of military discipline. Brutus, the murderer of Cæsar, was a man of a _resolute_ temper.  
**DECIDED, DECISIVE.** — _Decided_ marks that which is actually _decided: decisive_, that which appertains to _decision. Decided_ is employed for persons or things; _decisive_ only for things. A person's aversion or attachment is _decided;_ a sentence, a judgment, or a victory is _decisive._ A man of a _decided_ character always adopts _decisive_ measures. It is right to be _decidedly_ averse to everything which is immoral: we should be cautious not to pronounce _decisively_ on any point where we are not perfectly clear and well grounded in our opinion. In every popular commotion it is the duty of a good subject to take a _decided_ part in favor of law and order: such is the nature of law that if it were not _decisive_ it would be of no value.  
**DECISION, JUDGMENT, SENTENCE.** — _Decision_ signifies literally the act of _deciding_, or the thing _decided_ upon. _Judgment_ signifies the act of _judging_ or _determining_ in general. _Sentence_, in Latin _sententia_, from _sentire_, to think, signifies the opinion held or maintained.  
These terms, though very different in their original meaning, are now employed so that the two latter are species of the former: a final conclusion of any business is comprehended in them all; but _decision_ conveys none of the collateral ideas which are expressed by _judgment_ and _sentence:_ a _decision_ has no respect to the agent; it may be said of one or many; it may be the _decision_ of the court, of the nation, of the public, of a particular body of men, or of a private individual; but a _judgment_ is given in a public court or among private individuals: a _sentence_ is passed in a court of law or at the bar of the public. A _decision_ specifies none of the circumstances of the action: it may he a legal or an arbitrary _decision;_ it may be a _decision_ according to one's caprice or after mature deliberation: a _judgment_ is always passed either in a court of law, and consequently by virtue of authority, or it is passed by an individual by the authority of his own _judgment:_ a _sentence_ is passed either by the authority of law or at the discretion of an individual or of the public.  
A _decision_ is given; it is that which decides, and, by putting an end to all dispute and doubt, enables a person to act. A _judament_ is formed; it respects the guilt or innocence, the moral excellence or defects, of a person or thing; it enables a person to think. A _sentence_ is pronounced or passed; it respects all matters generally, and determines what are the sentiments of those by whom it is pronounced. Some points are of so complicated a nature that no _decision_ can be given upon them; some are of so high a nature that they can be _decided_ only by the highest authority; men are forbidden by the Christian religion to be severe in their _judgments_ upon one another; the works of an author must sometimes await the _sentence_ of impartial posterity before their value can be duly appreciated. 

####decisive

####declaim 
**DECLAIM, INVEIGH.**  
_Declaim_, in Latin _declamo_, that is, _de_ and _clamo_, signifies literally to cry aloud in a set form of words. _Inveigh_ (see [abuse](entry://abuse); [invective](entry://invective)).  
The sense in which these words agree is that of using the language of displeasure against any person or thing: _declaim_ is used generally, _inveigh_ particularly: public men and public measures are subjects for the _declaimer;_ private individuals afford subjects for _inveighing_ against: the former is under the influence of particular opinions or prejudices; the latter is the fruit of personal resentment or displeasure: politicians _declaim_ against the conduct of those in power or the state of the nation; they _inveigh_ against individuals who have offended them. A _declaimer_ is noisy; he is a man of words; he makes long and loud speeches: an _inveigher_ is virulent and personal; he enters into private details, and often indulges his malignant feelings under an affected regard for morality. 

####declare 
**DECLARE, PUBLISH, PROCLAIM.**  
_Declare_, in Latin _declare_, compounded of _de_ and _clarus_, clear, signifies literally to make clear or show plainly to a person. _Publish_ (see [announce](entry://announce)). _Proclaim_, in Latin _proclame_, compounded of _pro_ and _clamo_, signifies to cry before or in the ears of others.  
The idea of making known is common to all these terms: this is simply the signification of _declare_, but the other two include accessory ideas. The word _declare_ does not express any particular mode or circumstance of making known, as is implied by the others: we may _declare_ publicly or privately; we _publish_ and _proclaim_ only in a public manner: we may declare by word of mouth or by writing; we _publish_ or _proclaim_ by any means that will render the thing most generally known. In _declaring_, the leading idea is that of speaking out that which passes in the mind; in _publishing_, the leading idea is that of making public or common; in _proclaiming_, the leading idea is that of crying aloud; we may, therefore, often _declare_ by _publishing_ and _proclaiming:_ a _declaration_ is a personal act; it concerns the person _declaring_, or him to whom it is _declared;_ its truth or falsehood depends upon the. veracity of the speaker: a _publication_ is of general interest; the truth or falsehood of it does not always rest with the _publisher:_ a _proclamation_ is altogether a public act, in which no one's veracity is implicated. Pacts and opinions are _declared;_ events and circumstances are _published;_ the measures of government are _proclaimed:_ it is folly for a man to _declare_ anything to be true which he is not certain to be so, and wickedness in him to _declare_ that to be true which he knows to be false: whoever _publishes_ all he hears will be in great danger of _publishing_ many falsehoods; whatever is _proclaimed_ is supposed to be of sufficient importance to deserve the notice of all who may hear or read.  
A _declaration_ is always a personal act, whether relating to public or private matters: a _publication_ and a _proclamation_ may be both indirect actions made by any channel the fittest to make a wide communication. In cases of war or peace, princes are expected to _declare_ themselves on one side or the other; in the political world intelligence is quickly _published_ through the medium of the public papers; in private life domestic occurrences are _published_ with equal celerity through the medium of tale-bearers; _proclaiming_ is not confined to political matters: whatever is made known after the manner of a _proclamation_ is said to be _proclaimed:_ joyful news is _proclaimed_, and where private matters which ought not to be known are _published_ to the world people are said to _proclaim_ their own shame.

####decree 
**DECREE, EDICT, PROCLAMATION.**  
_Decree_, in French _décret_, Latin _decretus_, from _decernere_, to give judgment or pass sentence, signifies the sentence or resolution that is passed. _Edict_, in Latin _edictus_, from _edico_, to say out, signifies the thing spoken out or sent forth. _Proclamation_ (see [declare](entry://declare)).  
A _decree_ is a more solemn and deliberative act than an _edict;_ on the other hand, an _edict_ is more authoritative than a _decree._ A _decree_ is the decision of one or many; an _edict_ speaks the will of an individual: councils and senates, as well as princes, make _decrees;_ despotic rulers issue _edicts. Decrees_ are passed for the regulation of public and private matters; they are made known as occasion requires, but are not always public; _edicts_ and _proclamations_ contain the commands of the sovereign authority, and are directly addressed by the prince to his people. An _edict_ is peculiar to a despotic government; a _proclamation_ is common to a monarchical and aristocratic form of government: the ukase in Russia was a species of _edict_, by which the emperor made known his will to his people; the king of England communicates to his subjects the _determinations_ of himself and his council by means of a _proclamation._  
The term _decree_ is applied figuratively; the other terms are used, for the most part, in their proper sense only.

####dedicate 
**DEDICATE, DEVOTE, CONSECRATE, HALLOW.**  
_Dedicate_, in Latin _dedicatus_, participle from _de_ and _dicare_, signifies to set apart by a promise. _Devote_, in Latin _devotus_, participle from _devoveo_, signifies to vow for an express purpose. _Consecrate_, in Latin _consecratus_, from _consecro_, or _con_ and _sacrare_, signifies to make sacred by a special act. _Hallow_, from Anglo-Saxon _halig_, holy, signifies to make holy.  
There is something more solemn in the act of _dedicating_ than in that of _devoting;_ but less so than in that of _consecrating._ To _dedicate_ and _devote_ may be employed in both temporal and spiritual matters; to _consecrate_ and _hallow_ only in the spiritual sense: we may _dedicate_ or _devote_ anything that is at our disposal to the service of some object; but the former is employed mostly in regard to superiors, and the latter to persons without distinction of rank: we _dedicate_ a house to the service of God; or we _devote_ our time to the benefit of our friends or the relief of the poor: we may _dedicate_ or _devote_ ourselves to an object; but the former always implies a solemn setting apart springing from a sense of duty; the latter an entire application of one's self from zeal and affection; in this manner he who _dedicates_ himself to God abstracts himself from every object which is not immediately connected with the service of God; he who _devotes_ himself to the ministry pursues it as the first object of his attention and regard. To _consecrate_ is a species of formal _dedication_ by virtue of a religious observance; it is applicable mostly to places and things connected with religious works: _hallow_ is a species of informal _consecration_ applied to the same objects: the church is _consecrated;_ particular days are _hallowed._

####deduce 
See [derive](entry://derive)

####deduct 
**DEDUCT, SUBTRACT.**  
_Deduct_, from the Latin _deductus_, participle of _deducere_, to lead away, and _subtract_, from _subtractum_, participle of _subtrahere_, to draw away, have both the sense of taking from, but the former is used in a general, and the latter in a technical sense. He who makes an estimate is obliged to _deduct;_ he who makes a calculation is obliged to _subtract._ The tradesman _deducts_ what has been paid from what remains due; the accountant _subtracts_ small sums from the gross amount.  
**DEDUCTION, ABATEMENT.** — Both these words imply a taking off from something, but the _deduction is_ made at the discretion of the person deducting; while the _abatement_ is made for the convenience or at the desire of the person for whom it is made. A person may make a _deduction_ in an account for various reasons, but he makes an _abatement_ in a demand when it is objected to as excessive; so an _abatement_ may be made in a calculation when it is supposed to be higher than it ought to be.  
See also [conclusion](entry://conclusion)

####deed 
**DEED, EXPLOIT, ACHIEVEMENT, FEAT.**  
_Deed_, allied to _do_, expresses the thing done. _Exploit_, in French _exploit_, was most probably changed from _explicatus_, signifying the thing unfolded or displayed. _Achievement_ comes from French à _chef_, to a head, meaning something brought to a head or finished. _Feat_, in French _fait_, Latin _factum_, from _facio_, signifies the thing done.  
The first three words rise progressively on one another: _deeds_, compared with the others, is employed for that which is ordinary or extraordinary; _exploit_ and _achievement_ are used only for the extraordinary; the latter in a higher sense than the former. _Deeds_ must always be characterized as good or bad, magnanimous or atrocious, and the like, except in poetry, when the term becomes elevated.  
_Exploit_ and _achievement_ do not necessarily require such epithets; they are always taken in the proper sense for something great. _Exploit_, when compared with _achievement_, is a term used in plain prose; it designates not so much what is great as what is real: _achievement_ is most adapted to poetry and romance; an _exploit_ is properly a single act, and refers to the efforts of the individual performing it; an _achievement_ may involve many acts and circumstances; in the execution it refers us to the point gained, as also to the difficulties of gaining it. An _exploit_ marks only personal bravery in action; an _achievement_ denotes elevation of character in every respect, grandeur of design, promptitude in execution, and valor in action. An _exploit_ may be executed by the design and at the will of another; a common soldier or an army may perform _exploits._ An _achievement_ is designed and executed by the _achiever:_ Hercules is distinguished for bis _achievements;_ and in the same manner we speak of the _achievements_ of knights-errant or of great commanders.  
_Feat_ approaches nearest to _exploit_ in signification; the former marks skill, and the latter resolution. The _feats_ of chivalry displayed in jousts and tournaments were in former times as much esteemed as warlike _exploits. Exploit_ and _feat_ are often used in derision, to mark the absence of skill or bravery in the actions of individuals. The soldier who affects to be foremost in situations where there is no danger cannot be more properly derided than by terming his action an _exploit;_ he "who prides himself on the display of skill in the performance of a paltry trick may be laughed at for having performed a _feat._ The same words may also be applied in an indifferent sense to familiar objects, as the _exploits_ of a freebooter, or _feats_ of horsemanship.

**DEFACE, DISFIGURE, DEFORM.**  
_Deface, disfigure_, and _deform_, signify literally to spoil the _face, figure_, and _form. Deface_ expresses more than either _deform_ or _disfigure._ To _deface_ is an act of destruction; it is the actual destruction of that which has before existed: to _disfigure_ is either an act of destruction or an erroneous execution, which takes away the figure: to _deform_ is altogether an imperfect execution, which renders the _form_ what it should not be. A thing is _defaced_ by design; it is _disfigured_ either by design or accident; it is _deformed_ either by an error or by the nature of the thing. Persons only _deface;_ persons or things _disfigure;_ things are most commonly _deformed_ of themselves. That may be _defaced_, the face or external surface of which may be injured or destroyed; that may be _disfigured_ or _deformed_, the figure or form of which is imperfect or may be rendered imperfect. A fine painting or piece of writing is _defaced_ which is torn or besmeared with dirt: a fine building is _disfigured_ by any want of symmetry in its parts: a building is _deformed_ that is made contrary to all form. A statue may be _defaced, disfigured_, and _deformed:_ it is _defaced_ when any violence is done to the face or any outward part of the body; it is _disfigured_ by the loss of a limb; it is _deformed_ if made contrary to the perfect form of the person or thing to be represented. Inanimate objects are mostly _defaced_ or _disfigured_, but seldom _deformed;_ animate objects are either _disfigured_ or _deformed_, but seldomer _defaced._ A person may _disfigure_ himself by his dress; he is _deformed_ by the hand of nature.

####defeat 
**DEFEAT, FOIL, DISAPPOINT, FRUSTRATE.**  
_Defeat_ (see [beat](entry://beat)). _Foil_ comes from Late Latin _fullare_, to full cloth, a method of cleaning. It originally meant to trample on, then to defeat by less obvious physical action. _Frustrate_, in Latin _frustratus_, from _frustra_, vain, signifies to make vain. _Disappoint_, from the privative _dis_ and the verb _appoint_, signifies literally to do away with what has been appointed.  
_Defeat_ and _foil_ are both applied to matters of enterprise; but that may be _defeated_ which is only planned, and that is _foiled_ which is in the act of being executed. What is rejected is _defeated:_ what is aimed at or purposed is _frustrated:_ what is calculated on is _disappointed._ The best concerted schemes may sometimes be easily _defeated:_ where art is employed against simplicity, the latter may be easily _foiled:_ when we aim at what is above our reach, we must be _frustrated_ in our endeavors: when our expectations are extravagant, it seems to follow, of course, that they will be _disappointed._ Design or accident may tend to _defeat_, design only to _foil_, accident only to _frustrate_ or _disappoint._ The superior force of the enemy, or a combination of untoward events which are above the control of the commander, will serve to _defeat_ the best concerted plans of the best generals: men of upright minds can seldom _foil_ the deep-laid schemes of knaves: when we see the perversity of men is liable to _frustrate_ the kind intentions of others in their behalf, it is wiser to leave them to their folly: the cross accidents of human life are a fruitful source of _disappointment_ to those who suffer themselves to be affected by them.

####defection 
**DEFECTION, REVOLT.**  
_Defection_, from the Latin _de_, negative, and _facere_, to do, signifies literally an undoing. _Revolt_ comes from French _re_ and the verb _volvere_, to roll, meaning to roll back, to overturn, to turn against.  
_Defection_ is a general, _revolt_ a specific term, that is, it denotes a species of _defection. Defection_ is applicable to any person or thing to which we are bound by any obligation; _revolt_ is applicable only to the government to which one is bound. There may be a _defection_ from religion, or any cause that is held sacred: a _revolt_ is only against a monarch or the supreme authority.  
_Defection_ does not designate the mode of the action; it may be quietly made or otherwise: a _revolt_ is an act of violence, and always attended with violence. The _defection_ may be the act of one; a revolt is properly the act of many. A general may be guilty of a _defection_ who leaves the party to which he has hitherto adhered; a nation or a community may commit an act of _revolt_ by shaking off the authority under which they have lived. A _defection_, being mostly the act of an individual, or one part of a community against the whole, is mostly a culpable act; but a _revolt_ may be a justifiable measure when one nation _revolts_ against another, under whose power it has been brought by force of arms: the Roman people were guilty of a _defection_ when they left the senate and retired to Mount Aventine; the Germans frequently attempted to recover their liberty by _revolting_ against the Romans. 

####defective 
**DEFECTIVE, DEFICIENT.**  
_Defective_ expresses the quality or property of having a _defect_ (see [blemish](entry://blemish)); _deficient_ is employed with regard to the thing itself that is wanting. A book may be _defective_, in consequence of some leaves being _deficient;_ a child may de _defective_ because of some mental _deficiency._ A _deficiency_ is therefore often what constitutes a _defect._ Many things, however, may be _defective_ without having any _deficiency_, and _vice versa._ Whatever is misshapen, and fails either in beauty or utility, is _defective;_ that which is wanted to make a thing complete is _deficient._ It is a _defect_ in the eye when it is so constructed that things are not seen at their proper distances; there is a _deficiency_ in a tradesman's accounts when one side falls short of the other. That which is _defective_ is most likely to be permanent; but a _deficiency_ may be only occasional and easily rectified. 

####defend 
**DEFEND, PROTECT, VINDICATE.**  
_Defend_ (see [apologize](entry://apologize)). _Protect_, in Latin _protectum_, participle of _protegere_, compounded of _pro_, before, and _tegere_, to cover, signifies to put anything before a person as a covering. _Vindicate_ (see [assert](entry://assert)).  
_Defend_ is a general term; it defines nothing with regard to the degree and manner of the action: _protect_ is a particular and positive term, expressing an action of some considerable importance. Persons may _defend_ others without distinction of rank or station: none but superiors or persons having power can _protect_ others. _Defence_ is an occasional action; _protection_ is a permanent action. A person may be _defended_ in any particular case of actual danger or difficulty; he is _protected_ from what may happen as well as what does happen. _Defence_ respects the evil that threatens; _protection_ involves the supply of necessities and the affording comforts.  
_Defence_ requires some active exertion either of body or mind; _protection_ may consist only of the extension of power in behalf of any particular individual. A _defence_ is successful or unsuccessful; a _protection_, weak or strong. A soldier _defends_ his country; a counsellor _defends_ his client; a prince _protects_ his subjects.  
In a figurative and extended sense things may either _defend_ or _protect_ with a similar distinction: a coat _defends_ us from the inclemencies of the weather; houses are a _protection_ not only against the changes of the seasons, but also against the violence of men.  
To _vindicate_ is a species of _defence_ only in the moral sense of the word. Acts of importance are _defended:_ those of trifling import are commonly _vindicated._ Cicero _defended_ Milo against the charge of murder, in which he was implicated by the death of Clodius; a child or a servant _vindicates_ himself when any blame is attached to him. _Defence_ is employed either in matters of opinion or conduct; _vindicate_ only in matters of conduct. Some opinions are too absurd to be openly _defended; he_ who _vindicates_ the conduct of another should be fully satisfied of the innocence of the person whom he _defends._

**DEFENDANT, DEFENDER.** — The _defendant_ defends himself; the _defender_ defends another. We are _defendants_ when any charge is brought against us which we wish to refute: we are _defenders_ when we undertake to rebut or refute the charge brought against any person or thing.  
**DEFENDER, ADVOCATE, PLEADER.** — A _defender_ exerts himself in favor of one who wants support: an _advocate_, from the Latin _ad_, to, and _vocare_, to call, signifies one who is called to speak in favor of another; he exerts himself in favor of any cause that offers: a _pleader_, from _plea_ or _excuse_, signifies him who pleads in behalf of one who is accused or in distress. A _defender_ attempts to keep off a threatened injury by rebutting the attack of another: an _advocate_ states that which is to the advantage of the person or thing _advocated;_ a _pleader_ throws in _pleas_ and extenuations; he blends entreaty with argument. Oppressed or accused persons and disputed opinions require _defenders;_ that which falls in with the humors of men will always have _advocates;_ the unfortunate and the guilty require _pleaders._  
An official, known as the _public defender_, has been appointed recently in a number of cities in the United States, to defend in courts persons unable to pay lawyers' fees.  
The term _pleader_ is used sometimes like that of _defender_, in the general sense. Valeria and Volumnia, the mother and wife of Coriolanus, were powerful and successful _pleaders_ in behalf of the Roman republic.  
**DEFENSIBLE, DEFENSIVE.** — _Defensible_ is employed for the thing that is to be _defended; defensive_, for the thing that _defends._ An opinion or a line of conduct is _defensible;_ a weapon or a military operation is _defensive._ The _defensible_ is opposed to the _indefensible; a_nd the _defensive_ to the _offensive._ It is the height of folly to attempt to _defend_ that which is _indefensible;_ it is sometimes prudent to act on the _defensive_ when we are not in a condition to commence the offensive.

####definite 
**DEFINITE, POSITIVE.**  
_Definite_, in Latin _definitum_, participle of _definire_, compounded of _de_ and _finis_, signifies that which is bounded by a line or limit. _Positive_, in Latin _positivus_, from _ponere_, to place, signifies that which is placed or fixed.  
_Definite_ signifies that which is defined, or has the limits drawn or marked out; _positive_ that which is placed or fixed in a particular manner: _definite_ is said of things as they present themselves or are presented to the mind, as a _definite_ idea, a _definite_ proposal; _positive_ is said of a person's temper of mind; a person is _positive_ as to his opinions, or an assurance is _positive_ which serves to make one _positive._ In respect to a man's self, his views ought to be _definite_ to prevent him from being misled, but he ought not to be _positive_ in matters that admit of doubt. In respect to others, the more _definite_ the instructions which are given the less danger there is of mistake; the more _positive_ the information communicated the greater the reliance which is placed upon it. 

####definition 
**DEFINITION, EXPLANATION.**  
A _definition_ is properly a species of _explanation._ The former is used scientifically, the latter on ordinary occasions; the former is confined to words, the latter is employed for words or things. A _definition_ is correct or precise; an _explanation_ is general or ample. The _definition_ of a word defines or limits the extent of its signification; it is the rule for the scholar in the use of any word: the _explanation_ of a word may include both definition and illustration: the former admits of no more words than will include the leading features in the meaning of any term; the latter admits of an unlimited scope for diffuseness on the part of the explainer. 

####deflect 
**DEFLECT, BEND, DIVERGE, SWERVE.**  
_Deflect_ is the Latin term; _bend_, the Anglo-Saxon word. _Bend_, Anglo-Saxon _bendan_, allied to _band, bind_, etc., means to curve as a bow is curved when the string is fastened. _Deflect_, from _de_, from, and _flectere_, to bend, means to bend from the straight course, especially to turn to one side. _Diverge_, from Latin _dis_, apart, and _vergere_, to bend, is the intransitive corresponding to the transitive _deflect._ We _deflect_ another's course; we _diverge_ from that which we have marked out for ourselves. _Bend_ is a more general word than _deflect_ or _diverge._ It indicates the physical act of bending, and suggests any kind of departure from the condition of straightness. _Deflect_ suggests a turning from a straight line contrary to all apparent intention or purpose. _Swerve_, Anglo-Saxon _sweorfan_, suggests a very sudden turning, a jerky and unpremeditated movement, emphasizing the idea of action contrary to apparent purpose, barely suggested in _deflect._ All these words may be used either with the physical or with a moral application.

####degenerate 
**DEGENERATE, DETERIORATE.**  
_Degenerate_ signifies to fall from race or kind, to lose ancestral quality, from Latin _degenerare_, compounded of _de_, from, and the stem of _genus_, race. _Deteriorate_ comes from Latin _deteriorare_, to grow worse, from the comparative of an obsolete adjective connected with _de_, down. Both these words mean to grow worse, but _degenerate_ adds to the idea contained in _deteriorate_ a definite indication that the deterioration is a departure from the standard of the individual's race or natural endowment. It is therefore more specific in its implications.

####deity 
**DEITY, DIVINITY.**  
_Deity_, from _deus_, a god, signifies a divine person. _Divinity_, from _divinus_, signifies the _divine_ essence or power; the _deities_ of the heathens had little of _divinity_ in them; the _divinity_ of our Saviour is a fundamental article in the Christian faith. 

####dejection 
**DEJECTION, DEPRESSION, MELANCHOLY.**  
_Dejection_, from _dejicere_, to cast down, and _depression_, from _deprimere_, to press or sink down, have both regard to the state of the animal spirits. _Melancholy_, from the Greek _μελαγχολία_, black bile, originally referred to the state of the humors in general, or of the particular humor called the bile.  
_Dejection_ and _depression_ are occasional, and depend on outward circumstances; _melancholy_ is permanent, and lies in the constitution. _Depression_ is but a degree of _dejection:_ slight circumstances may occasion a _depression:_ distressing events occasion a _dejection_: the death of a near and dear relative may be expected to produce _dejection_ in persons of the greatest equanimity; lively tempers are most liable to _depressions; melancholy_ is a disease which nothing but clear views of religion can possibly correct. 

####delay 
**DELAY, DEFER, POSTPONE, PROCRASTINATE, PROLONG, PROTRACT, RETARD.**  
_Delay_, compounded of _de_ and _lay_, signifies to lay or keep back. _Defer_, compounded of _de_ and _ferre_, to bring, signifies to put off. _Postpone_, compounded of _post_ and the Latin _ponere_, to place, signifies to place behind or after. _Procrastinate_, from _pro_, for, and _cras_, to-morrow, signifies to put off until to-morrow. _Prolong_ signifies to lengthen out the time, and _protract_ to draw out the time. _Retard_, from _re_, intensive, and _tardum_, slow, to make a thing go slowly.  
To _delay_ is simply not to commence action; to _defer_ and _postpone_ are to fix its commencement at a more distant period: we may _delay_ a thing for days, hours, and minutes; we _defer_ or _postpone_ it for months or weeks. _Delays_ mostly arise from the fault of the person _delaying;_ they are seldom reasonable or advantageous: _deferring_ and _postponing_ are discretionary acts, which are justified by the circumstances; indolent people are most prone to _delay;_ when a plan is not maturely digested, it is prudent to _defer_ its execution until everything is in an entire state of preparation. _Procrastination_ is a culpable _delay_ arising solely from the fault of the _procrastinator:_ it is the part of a dilatory man to _procrastinate_ that which it is both his interest and duty to perform.  
We _delay_ the execution of a thing; we _prolong_ or _protract_ the continuation of a thing; we _retard_ the termination of a thing: we may _delay_ answering a letter, _prolong_ a contest, _protract_ a lawsuit, and _retard_ a publication.  
**DELAY, LACHES, MORATORIUM.** — _Laches_ and _moratorium_ are two special applications of the idea of _delay._ They are not synonymous with each other at all, but they are connected through the general idea expressed in the key-word. _Laches_ is a legal term (from Latin _laxus_, loose), signifying inexcusable delay in meeting the terms of a contract, or taking up and paying a promissory note. _Moratorium_, on the other hand, signifies a delay granted by a government, corporation, or other large body to persons to _delay_ making payment of their obligations beyond the time of their maturity. 

####delegate 
**DELEGATE, DEPUTE; DELEGATE, DEPUTY. **  
_Delegate_, in Latin _delegatus_, from _delegare_, signifies to send on a mission; _depute_ comes from _deputare_, to assign a business to. To _delegate_ is applied to the power or office which is given; _depute_ to the person employed. Parents _delegate_ their office to the instructor; persons are _deputed_ to act for others.  
As nouns, _delegate_ and _deputy_ are applied only to persons. The _delegate_ is the person commissioned, who is bound to act according to his commission; the _deputy_ is the person _deputed_, who acts in the place of another, but may act according to his own discretion or otherwise, as circumstances require. A _delegate_ is mostly chosen in public matters and on particular occasions: as _delegates_ sent from a besieged town, to the camp of the besiegers; _deputies_ are those who are _deputed_ to act officially and regularly for others, as _deputies_ sent to any public assembly.

####delightful 
**DELIGHTFUL, CHARMING.**  
_Delightful_ is applied either to material or spiritual objects; _charming_, mostly to objects of sense. When they both denote the pleasure of the sense, _delightful_ is not so strong an expression as _charming:_ but the latter rises to a degree that carries the senses away captive. Of music we should rather say that it was _charming_ than _delightful_, as it acts on the senses in so powerful a manner; on the other hand, we should with more propriety speak of a _delightful_ employment to relieve distress, or a _delightful_ spectacle to see a family living together in love and harmony. 

####delineate 
**DELINEATE, SKETCH.**  
_Delineate_, in Latin _delineatus_, participle of _delineare_, from _de_, down, and _linea_, Une, means literally to put down lines on paper. _Sketch_, Dutch and Italian _schizzo_, a first rough draft, comes from Latin _schedium_, a thing made hastily, from Greek _σχέδιος_, hastily.  
Both these terms are properly employed in the art of drawing, and figuratively applied to moral subjects to express a species of descriptions: a _delineation_ expresses something more than a _sketch;_ the former conveying not merely the general outlines or more prominent features, but also as much of the details as would serve to form a whole; the latter, however, seldom contains more than some broad touches by which an imperfect idea of the subject is conveyed. A _delineation_, therefore, may be characterized as accurate, and a _sketch_ as hasty or imperfect: an attentive observer who has passed some years in a country may be enabled to give an accurate _delineation_ of the laws, customs, manners, and character of its inhabitants; a traveller who merely passes through can give only a hasty _sketch_ from what passes before his eyes. 

####delinquent 
See **offender** under [offence](entry://offence)

####deliver 
**DELIVER, RESCUE, SAVE.**  
_Deliver_, in French _délivrer_, from the Latin _de_, and _liberare_, from _liber_, free, signifies to make free. _Rescue_ comes from Late Latin _rescutere_, from _re_, again, and _excutere_, to drive. _Save_ signifies literally to make safe, from Latin _salvus_, safe.  
The idea of taking or keeping from any evil is common to these terms; but to _deliver_ and _rescue_ signify most properly to take, and _save_ to keep from evil. To _deliver_ is a general term, not defining either the mode or object of the action. One may be _delivered_ from any evil, whether great or small, and in any manner: to _rescue_ is to _deliver_ from a great impending danger or immediate evil; as to _rescue_ from the hands of robbers or from the jaws of a wild beast.  
One is _delivered_ mostly by some active effort; but we may be _saved_ either by active or passive means. A person is _delivered_ from the hands of an enemy by force or stratagem: he saves his life by flying.  
See also FILL; **give up** under [give](entry://give)  
**DELIVERANCE, DELIVERY.** — Both words are drawn from the same verb (see above) to express its different senses of taking from or giving to: the former denotes the taking something from one's self; the latter implies giving something to another. To wish for a _deliverance_ from that which is hurtful or painful is to a certain extent justifiable: the careful _delivery_ of property into the hands of the owner will be the first object of concern with a faithful agent.

####deluge

####delusion 
**DELUSION, ILLUSION.**  
Both these words, being derived from the Latin _ludere_, to play, are applied to such matters as act upon the imagination; but _delude_, by the force of the preposition _de_, signifies to carry away from the right line, to cause to deviate into error; while _illude_, from the preposition _il, im_, in or upon, signifies simply to act on the imagination. The former is therefore taken in a bad sense, but the latter in an indifferent sense. A deranged person falls into different kinds of _delusions:_ as when he fancies himself poor while he is very rich, or that every one who comes in his way is looking at him, or having evil designs against him, and the like; but there may be optical _illusions_, when an object is made to appear brighter or larger than it really is.  
See also **fallacy** under [fallacious](entry://fallacious); [hallucination](entry://hallucination)

####demand 
**DEMAND, REQUIRE.**  
_Demand_ (see [ask](entry://ask)). _Require_, in Latin _require_, compounded of _re_, again, and _quœrere_, to seek, signifies to seek for or to seek to get back.  
We _demand_ that which is owing and ought to be given; we _require_ that which we wish and expect to have done. A _demand_ is more positive than a _requisition;_ the former properly admits of no question; the latter is liable to be both questioned and refused: the creditor makes a _demand_ on the debtor; the master _requires_ a certain portion of duty from his servant: it is unjust to _demand_ of a person what he has no right to give; it is unreasonable to _require_ of him what it is not in his power to do. A thing is commonly _demanded_ in express words; it is _required_ by implication: a person _demands_ admittance. when it is not voluntarily granted; he _requires_ respectful deportment from those who are subordinate to him.  
In the figurative application the same sense is preserved: things of urgency and moment _demand_ immediate attention; difficult matters _require_ a steady attention.

####demise

####demolish 
**DEMOLISH, RAZE, DISMANTLE, DESTROY.**  
The throwing down what has been built up is the common idea included in all these terms. _Demolish_, from the Latin _demolior_, and _moles_, a mass or structure, signifies to decompound what has been fabricated into a mass. _Raze_, like _erase_ (see [blot](entry://blot)), signifies the making smooth or even with the ground. _Dismantle_, in French _démanteler_, signifies to deprive a thing of its mantle or guard. _Destroy_, from the Latin _destruo_, compounded of the privative _de_ and _struo_, to build, signifies properly to pull down.  
A fabric is _demolished_ by scattering all its component parts; it is mostly an unlicensed act of caprice; it is _razed_ by way of punishment, as a mark of public vengeance; a fortress is _dismantled_ from motives of prudence, in order to render it defenceless; places are _destroyed_ by various means and from various motives, that they may not exist any longer. Individuals may _demolish;_ public authority causes an edifice to be _razed_ with the ground; a general orders towers to be _dismantled_ and fortifications to be _destroyed._

####demur 
**DEMUR, HESITATE, PAUSE.**  
_Demur_, in French _demeurer_, Latin _demorari_, signifies to keep back. _Hesitate_, in Latin _hœsitatum_, participle of _hœsito_, a frequentative from _hœreo_, signifies to stick or remain a long time back. _Pause_, in Latin _pausa_, from the Greek _παύω_, cease, signifies to make a stand.  
The idea of stopping is common to these terms, to which signification is added some distinct collateral idea for each: we _demur_ from doubt or difficulty; we _hesitate_ from an undecided state of mind; we _pause_ from circumstances. _Demurring_ is a matter of prudence, it is always grounded on some reason; _hesitating_ is rather a matter of feeling and is oftener faulty than otherwise: when a proposition appears to be unjust, we _demur_ in supporting it, on the ground of its injustice; when a request of a dubious nature is made to us, we _hesitate_ in complying with it: prudent people are most apt to _demur;_ but people of a wavering temper are apt to _hesitate: demurring_ may be often unnecessary, but it is seldom injurious; _hesitating_ is mostly injurious when it is not necessary. _Demurring_ and _hesitating_ are both employed as acts of the mind; _pausing_ is an external action: we _demur_ and _hesitate_ in determining; we _pause_ in speaking or doing anything.  
**DEMUR, DOUBT, HESITATION, OBJECTION.** — _Demur_ (see above). _Doubt_, in Latin _dubito_, from _duo_, two, and _itus_, past participle of _ire_, to go, signifies to go two ways. _Hesitation_ (see above). _Objection_, from _objicio_, or _ob_, in the way, and _jacere_, to throw, to throw in the way, signifies what is thrown in the way so as to stop our progress.  
_Demurs_ often occur in matters of deliberation; _doubt_ in regard to matters of fact; _hesitation_ in matters of ordinary conduct; and _objections_ in matters of common consideration. Artabanes made many _demurs_ to the proposed invasion of Greece by Xerxes.  
_Doubts_ have been suggested respecting the veracity of Herodotus as a historian.  
It is not proper to ask that which cannot be granted without _hesitation;_ and it is not the part of an amiable disposition to make a _hesitation_ in complying with a reasonable request. There are but few things which we either attempt to do or recommend to others that are not liable to some kind of an _objection._  
A _demur_ stops the adjustment of any plan or the _determination_ of any question.  
A _doubt_ interrupts the progress of the mind in coming to a state of satisfaction and certainty.  
The last two words are both applied to abstract questions, or such as are of general interest. _Hesitation_ and _objection_ are more individual and private in their nature. _Hesitation_ lies mostly in the state of the will; _objection_ is rather the offspring of the understanding. A _hesitation_ interferes with the action; an _objection_ affects the measure or the mode of action. 

####denomination 
See [name](entry://name)

####denote 
**DENOTE, SIGNIFY.**  
_Denote_, in Latin _denote_ or _noto_, from _notum_, participle of _nosco_, signifies to cause to know. _Signify_, from the Latin _signum_, a sign, and _facere_, to make, is to become or be made a sign or guide for the understanding.  
_Denote_ is employed with regard to things and their characters; _signify_, with regard to the thoughts or movements. A letter or character may be made to _denote_ any number, as words are made to _signify_ the intentions and wishes of the person. Among the ancient Egyptians hieroglyphics were very much employed to _denote_ certain moral qualities; in many cases looks or actions will _signify_ more than words. Devices and emblems of different descriptions, drawn either from fabulous history or the natural world, are likewise now employed to _denote_ particular circumstances or qualities: the cornucopia _denotes_ plenty; the beehive _denotes_ industry; the dove _denotes_ meekness, and the lamb gentleness: he who will not take the trouble to _signify_ his wishes otherwise than by nods or signs must expect to be frequently misunderstood.

####deny 
**DENY, REFUSE.**  
_Deny_, in Latin _de_, from, and _negare_, to say no, from _ne_, not, signifies to say no to a thing. _Refuse_, in Latin _refusus_, from _re_ and _fundere_, to pour or cast, signifies to throw off from one.  
To _deny_ respects matters of fact or knowledge; to _refuse_, matters of wish or request. We _deny_ what immediately relates to ourselves; we _refuse_ what relates to another. We _deny_ as to the past; we _refuse_ as to the future: we _deny_ our participation in that which has been; we _refuse_ our participation in that which may be: to _deny_ must always be expressly verbal; a _refusal_ may sometimes be signified by actions or looks as well as words. A _denial_ affects our veracity; a _refusal_ affects our good-nature.  
But to _deny_ signifies in this case simply to withhold; and _refuse_ signifies to cast off from one, which is a more positive act: to _deny_ one's self a pleasure is simply to _abstain_ from it; but to _refuse_ one s food is to cast it from one with a positive indisposition. What is _denied_ may be _denied_ by circumstances or by Providence; and it may be _denied_ to one, many, or all; but what is _refused_ is _refused_ by and to particular individuals.

####dependence 
**DEPENDENCE, RELIANCE.**  
_Dependence_, from _depend_, from Latin _de, from_, and _pendere_, to hang, signifies, literally, to rest one's weight by hanging from that which is held. _Rely_, compounded of _re_ and _lie_, signifies likewise to rest one's weight by lying or hanging back from the object held.  
_Dependence_ is the general term; _reliance_ is a species of _dependence:_ we _depend_ either on persons or things; we _rely_ on persons only: _dependence_ serves for that which is immediate or remote; _reliance_ serves for the future only. We _depend_ upon a person for that which we are obliged to receive or led to expect from him: we _rely_ upon a person for that which he has given us reason to expect from him. _Dependence_ is an outward condition or the state of external circumstances; _reliance_ is a state of the feelings with regard to others. We _depend_ upon God for all that we have or shall have; we _rely_ upon the word of man for that which he has promised to perform. We may _depend_ upon a person's coming from a variety of causes; but we _rely_ upon it only in reference to his avowed intention.

####deplore 
**DEPLORE, LAMENT.**  
_Deplore_ comes from Latin _deplorare_, from _de_, intensive, and _plorare_, to weep. _Lament_, see [bewail](entry://bewail).  
_Deplore_ is a much stronger expression than _lament;_ the former calls forth tears from the bitterness of the heart; the latter excites a cry from the warmth of feeling. _Deploring_ indicates despair; to _lament_ marks only pain or distress. Among the poor we have _deplorable_ instances of poverty, ignorance, vice, and wretchedness combined; among the higher classes we have often _lamentable_ instances of extravagance and consequent ruin. A field of battle or a city overthrown by an earthquake is a spectacle truly _deplorable:_ it is _lamentable_ to see beggars putting on all the disguises of wretchedness in order to obtain by deceit what they might earn by honest industry. The condition of a dying man suffering under the agonies of an awakened conscience is _deplorable;_ the situation of the relative or friend who witnesses the agony, without being able to afford consolation to the sufferer, is truly _lamentable._

####deponent 
**DEPONENT, EVIDENCE, WITNESS.**  
_Deponent_, from _deponere_, to lay down or set forth, signifies he who declares or substantiates anything. The _evidence_, from _evident_, is that which makes _evident;_ and the _witness_, from the Anglo-Saxon _witan_, to know, signifies he who makes known.  
All these words are properly applied to judicial proceedings, where the _deponent_ deposes generally to facts either in causes or otherwise: the _evidence_ consists either of persons or things, which are brought before the court for the purpose of making a doubtful matter clear; the _witness_ is always a person who bears witness to any fact for or against another. _Evidence_ is applied to moral objects, in the proper sense, and _witness_ in the figurative application.

####deposit 
**DEPOSIT, PLEDGE, SECURITY.**  
_Deposit_ is a general term, from the Latin _depositus_, participle of _deponere_, signifying to lay down, or put into the hands of another. _Pledge_ comes through French from Old Low German _plegan_, to promise. _Security_, the substantive corresponding to _secure_, comes from Latin se, privative, and _cura_, care, signifying free from care.  
The term _deposit_ has most regard to the confidence we place in another; _pledge_ has most regard to the security we give for ourselves; _security_ is a species of _pledge._ A _deposit_ is always voluntarily placed in the hands of an indifferent person; a _pledge_ and _security_ are required from the parties who are interested. A person may make a _deposit_ for purposes of charity or convenience; he gives a _pledge_ or _security_ for a temporary accommodation or the relief of a necessity. Money is _deposited_ in the hands of a friend in order to execute a commission: a _pledge_ is given as an equivalent for that which has been received: a _security_ is given by way of security for the performance of some agreement. A _deposit_ must consist of something movable, as money, papers, or jewels, which can be deposited or placed in the hands of another. It may sometimes serve as a _pledge_ or _security_ where it is intended to bind the party _depositing_ to anything. A _pledge_ may, properly speaking, be anything which serves to _pledge_ or bind a person by motives of interest, affection, or honor; it may consist of anything which is given to another for that purpose. A _security is_ whatever makes a person _secure_ against a loss, and in the ordinary acceptation consists of any instrument or written document which legally binds a person. In this sense, the person who binds himself for another becomes a _security._  
These words are all applied in this sense to moral objects.

####depravity 
**DEPRAVITY, DEPRAVATION, CORRUPTION.**  
_Depravity_, from the Latin_ pravitas_ and _pravus_, crooked or not straight, marks the quality of being crooked. _Depravation_, in Latin _depravatio_, signifies a making crooked, or not as it should be. _Corruption_, in Latin _corruptio, corrumpo_, from _rumpere_, to break, marks the disunion and decomposition of the parts of anything.  
All these terms are applied to objects which are contrary to the order of Providence, but the term _depravity_ characterizes the thing as it is; the terms _depravation_ and _corruption_ designate the making or causing it to be so; _depravity_, therefore, excludes the idea of any cause; _depravation_ always carries us to the cause or external agency: hence we may speak of _depravity_ as natural, but we speak of _depravation_ as the result of circumstance: there is a _depravity_ in man which nothing but the grace of God can correct; the introduction of obscenity on the stage tends greatly to the _depravation_ of morals; bad company tends to the _corruption_ of a young man's morals.  
_Depravity_ or _depravation_ implies crookedness or a distortion from the regular course; _corruption_ implies a _dissolution_, as it were, in the component parts of bodies. Cicero says (2 _De Finibus)_ that _depravity_ is applicable only to the mind and heart; but we say a _depraved_ taste, and _depraved_ humors in regard to the body. A _depraved_ taste loathes common food, and longs for that which is unnatural and hurtful. _Corruption_ is the natural process by which material substances are disorganized. In the figurative application of these terms they preserve the same signification. _Depravity_ is characterized by being directly opposed to order and an established system of things; _corruption_ marks the vitiation or spoiling of things, and the ferment that leads to destruction. _Depravity_ turns things out of their ordinary course; _corruption_ destroys their essential qualities. _Depravity_ is a vicious state of things, in which all is deranged and perverted: _corruption_ is a vicious state of things, in which all is sullied and polluted. That which is _depraved_ loses its proper manner of acting and existing; that which is _corrupted_ loses its virtue and essence.  
That is a _depraved_ state of morals in which the gross vices are openly practised in defiance of all decorum: that is a _corrupt_ state of society in which vice has secretly insinuated itself into all the principles and habits of men, and concealed its deformity under the fair semblance of virtue and honor. The manners of savages are most likely to be _depraved;_ those of civilized nations to be _corrupt_, when luxury and refinement are risen to an excessive pitch. Cannibal nations present us with the picture of human _depravity;_ the Roman nation, during the time of the emperors, affords us an example of almost universal _corruption._  
From the above observations it is clear that _depravity_ is best applied to those objects to which common usage has annexed the epithets of right, regular, fine, etc.; and _corruption_, to those which may be characterized by the epithets of sound, pure, innocent, or good. Hence we prefer to say _depravity_ of mind and _corruption_ of heart; _depravity_ of principle and _corruption_ of sentiment or feeling: a _depraved_ character; a _corrupt_ example; a _corrupt_ influence.  
In reference to the arts or belles-lettres we say either _depravity_ or _corruption_ of taste, because taste has its rules, is liable to be disordered, is or is not conformable to natural order, is regular or irregular; and, on the other hand, it may be so intermingled with sentiments and feelings foreign to its own native purity as to give it justly the title of _corrupt._ The last thing worthy of notice respecting the two words _depravity_ and _corruption_ is that the former is used for man in his moral capacity, but the latter for man in a political capacity: hence we speak of human _depravity_, but the _corruption_ of government.

####depredation 
**DEPREDATION, ROBBERY.**  
_Depredation_, in Latin _deprœdatio_, from _prœda_, a prey, conveys the idea of taking by way of prey. _Rob_ is allied to Anglo-Saxon _reaf_, the root found in _bereave_, and _robe, i.e._, that stripped from the slain; it signified to strip, despoil, take away. Both these words denote the taking what belongs to another, but differ in the circumstances of the action. _Depredation_ is not so lawless an act as _robbery;_ it may be excused, if not justified, by the laws of war or the hostile situation of parties to each other. The borderers on the confines of England and Scotland used to commit _depredations_ on each other. _Robbery_ is in direct violation of every law, it is committed only by those who set all laws at defiance. _Depredations_ may be committed in any manner short of direct violence; those who commit _depredations_ do so mostly in the absence of those on whom they are committed: _robberies_ are commonly committed on the persons, and mostly accompanied with violence. _Depredation_ taken absolutely refers us to that which the _depredator_ gains or gets to himself by the act; _robbery_ refers us to that which the person loses who is _robbed:_ the one goes away loaded with his plunder, the other goes away stripped of that which is most valuable to him.  
In the extended application of these words this distinction is kept up: birds commit _depredations_ on cornfields, bees _rob_ flowers of their honey.

####deprive 
**DEPRIVE, DEBAR, ABRIDGE.**  
_Deprive_, from _de_, from, and Latin _privus_, one's own, signifies to make not one's own what one has or expects to have. _Debar_, from _de_ and _bar_, signifies to prevent by means of a _bar. Abridge_ (see [abridge](entry://abridge)).  
_Deprive_ conveys the idea of either taking away that which one has or withholding that which one may have; _debar_ conveys the idea only of withholding; _abridge_ conveys that also of taking away. _Depriving_ is a coercive measure; _debar_ and _abridge_ are merely acts of authority. We are _deprived_ of that which is of the first necessity; we are _debarred_ of privileges, enjoyments, opportunities, etc.; we are _abridged_ of comforts, pleasures, conveniences, etc. Criminals are _deprived_ of their liberty; their friends are in extraordinary cases _debarred_ the privilege of seeing them; thus men are often _abridged_ of their comforts in consequence of their own faults. _Deprivations_ and _debarring_ sometimes arise from things as well as persons; _abridging_ is always the voluntary act of conscious agents. Religion teaches men to be resigned under the severest _deprivations;_ it is painful to be _debarred_ the society of those we love, or to _abridge_ others of any advantage which they have been in the habit of enjoying.  
When used as reflective verbs they preserve the same analogy in their signification. An extravagant person _deprives_ himself of the power of doing good. A person may _debar_ himself of any pleasure from particular motives of prudence. A miser _abridges_ himself of every enjoyment in order to gratify his ruling passion.

####depth 
**DEPTH, PROFUNDITY.**  
_Depth_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _deop_, and contains the same root as that found in _dip, dive_, etc. _Profundity_, from _profound_, in Latin _profundus_, compounded of _pro_, far, and _fundus_, the bottom, signifies remoteness from the lower surface of anything.  
These terms do not differ merely in their derivation; but _depth_ is indefinite in its signification; and _profundity_ is a positive and considerable degree of _depth._ Moreover, the word _depth_ is applied to objects in general; _profundity_ is confined in its application to moral objects: thus we speak of the _depth_ of the sea, or the _depth_ of a person's learning, but his _profundity_ of thought.

####derangement 
**DERANGEMENT, INSANITY, LUNACY, MADNESS, MANIA.**  
_Derangement_, from the verb to _derange_, implies the first stage of disordered intellect. _Insanity_, or unsoundness, from _in_, negative, and Latin _sanus_, whole, implies positive disease, which is more or less permanent. _Lunacy_ is a violent sort of _insanity_, which was supposed to be influenced by the moon, and is derived from Latin _luna_, the moon. Cf. Shakespeare's "moon-struck calf. _"Madness_, allied to Anglo-Saxon _gemœdan_, to drive mad, from a root meaning severely injured, and _mania_, Latin _mania_, Greek _μανία_, mental excitement, allied to _μένος_, mind, both imply insanity in its most furious and confirmed stage. _Deranged_ persons may sometimes be perfectly sensible about everything but particular subjects. _Insane_ persons are sometimes entirely restored. _Lunatics_ have their lucid intervals, and _maniacs_ their intervals of repose. _Derangement_ may sometimes be applied to the temporary confusion of a disturbed mind which is not in full possession of all its faculties: _madness_ may sometimes be the result of violently inflamed passions: and _mania_ may be applied to any vehement attachment which takes possession of the mind. 

####deride 
**DERIDE, MOCK, RIDICULE, RALLY, BANTER.**  
_Deride_ and _ridicule_ are both derived from Latin _ridere_, to smile at. _Mock_ comes from Late Latin _muccare_, to blow the nose (compare _mucus)_, indicating a scoffing, coarse gesture. _Rally_ is allied to _rail_, perhaps; its real origin is unknown. The origin of _banter_ is also obscure.  
Strong expressions of contempt are designated by all these terms. _Derision_ and _mockery_ evince themselves by the outward actions in general; _ridicule_ consists more in words than actions; _rallying_ and _bantering_ almost entirely in words. _Deride_ is not so strong a term as _mock_, but much stronger than _ridicule._ There is always a mixture of hostility in _derision_ and _mockery_, but _ridicule_ is frequently unaccompanied with any personal feeling of displeasure. _Derision_ is often deep, not loud; it discovers itself in suppressed laughter, contemptuous sneers or gesticulations, and cutting expressions: _mockery_ is mostly noisy and outrageous; it breaks forth in insulting buffoonery and is sometimes accompanied with personal violence: the former consists of real but contemptuous laughter; the latter often of affected laughter and grimace. _Derision_ and _mockery_ are always personal; _ridicule_ may be directed to things as well as persons. _Derision_ and _mockery_ are a direct attack on the individual, the latter still more so than the former; _ridicule_ is as often used in writing as in personal intercourse.  
_Rally_ and _banter_, like _derision_ and _mockery_, are altogether personal acts, in which application they are very analogous to _ridicule. Ridicule_ is the most general term of the three; we often _rally_ and _banter_ by _ridiculing._ There is more exposure in _ridiculing_, reproof in _rallying_, and provocation in _bantering._ A person may be _ridiculed_ on account of his eccentricities; he is _rallied_ for his defects; he is _bantered_ for accidental circumstances: the former two actions are often justified by some substantial reason; the last is an action as puerile as it is unjust, it is a contemptible species of _mockery._ Self-conceit and extravagant follies are oftentimes best corrected by good-natured _ridicule;_ a man may deserve sometimes to be _rallied_ for his want of resolution; those who are of an ill-natured turn of mind will _banter_ others for their misfortunes, or their personal defects, rather than not say something to their annoyance. 

####derive 
**DERIVE, TRACE, DEDUCE.**  
_Derive_, from the Latin _de_ and _rivus_, a river, signifies to draw, after the manner of water, from a source. _Trace_, Middle French _tracer_, is drawn ultimately from Latin _tractus_, the past participle of _trahere_, to draw or drag; and originally signified the mark left by drawing something across the surface, or the act of making such a mark. _Deduce_, in Latin _de_, from, and _ducere_, to lead, signifies to bring from.  
The idea of drawing one thing from another is included in all the actions designated by these terms. The act of _deriving_ is immediate and direct; that of _tracing_ a gradual process; that of _deducting_ a ratiocinative process. We discover causes and sources by _derivation;_ we discover the course, progress, and commencement of things by _tracing;_ we discover the grounds and reasons of things by _deduction._ A person _derives_ his name from a given source; he _traces_ his family up to a given period; principles or powers are _deduced_ from circumstances or observations. The Trojans _derived_ the name of their city from Tros, a king of Phrygia; they _traced_ the line of their kings up to Dardanus.

####desert 
**DESERT, MERIT, WORTH.**  
_Desert_, from _deserve_, in Latin _deservio_, signifies to do service or to be serviceable. _Merit_, in Latin _meritus_, participle of _mereor_, comes from the Greek _μέρος_, a share, because he who _merits_ anything has a right to share in it. _Worth_, in German _werth_, seems to come from a root found in Latin _vereri_, to respect.  
_Desert_ is taken for that which is good or bad; _merit_ for that which is good only. We _deserve_ praise or blame: we _merit_ a reward. _Desert_ consists in the action, work, or service performed; _merit_ has regard to the character of the agent or the nature of the action. A person does not _deserve_ a recompense until he has performed some service; he does not _merit_ approbation if he have not done his part well. _Deserve_ is a term of ordinary import; _merit_ applies to objects of greater moment: the former includes matters of personal and physical gratification; the latter those altogether of an intellectual nature. Criminals cannot always be punished according to their _deserts;_ a noble mind is not contented with barely obtaining, it seeks to _merit_ what it obtains.  
The idea of value, which is prominent in the signification of the term _merit_, renders it closely allied to that of _worth. Merit_ is that on which mankind set a value; it is sought for on account of the honor or advantages it brings: _worth_ is that which is absolutely valuable; it must be sought for on its own account.  
From these words are derived the epithets _deserved_ and _merited_, in relation to what we receive from others; and _deserving, meritorious, worthy_, and _worth_, in regard to what we possess in ourselves: a treatment is _deserved_ or _undeserved;_ reproofs are _merited_ or _unmerited:_ the harsh treatment of a master is easier to be borne when it is _undeserved_ than when it is _deserved;_ the reproaches of a friend are very severe when _unmerited._  
A laborer is _deserving_ on account of his industry; an artist is _meritorious_ on account of his professional abilities: a citizen is _worthy_ on account of his benevolence and uprightness. The first person _deserves_ to be well paid and encouraged; the second _merits_ the applause which is bestowed on him; the third is _worthy_ of confidence and esteem from all men. Between _worthy_ and _worth_ there is this difference, that the former is said of intrinsic and moral qualities, the latter of extrinsic ones: a _worthy_ man possesses that which calls for the esteem of others; but a man is _worth_ the property which he can call his own: so in like manner a subject may be _worthy_ the attention of a writer, or a thing may not be _worth_ the while to consider.

####design 
**DESIGN, PURPOSE, INTEND, MEAN.**  
_Design_, from the Latin _de_, down, and _signare_, to make a sign, signifies to mark out as with a pen or pencil. _Purpose_, like _propose_, comes through French from the Latin _pro_ and _pansare_, signifying to set before one's mind as an object of pursuit. _Intend_, in Latin _in_, to, and _tendere_, to stretch, signifies the bending of the mind toward an object. _Mean_, in Anglo-Saxon _mœnen_, German _meinen_, is probably connected with the word mind, signifying to have in the mind.  
_Design_ and _purpose_ are terms of higher import than _intend_ and _mean_, which are in familiar use; the latter still more so than the former. A _design_ embraces many objects; a _purpose_ consists of only one: the former supposes something studied and methodical, it requires reflection; the latter supposes something fixed and determinate, it requires resolution. A _design_ is attainable; a _purpose_ is steady. We speak of the _design_ as it regards the thing conceived; we speak of the _purpose_ as it regards the temper of the person. Men of a sanguine or aspiring character are apt to form _designs_ which cannot be carried into execution; whoever wishes to keep true to his _purpose_ must not listen to many counsellors.  
A _purpose_ is the thing proposed or set before the mind; an _intention_ is the thing to which the mind bends or inclines: _purpose_ and _intend_ differ, therefore, both in the nature of the action and the object; we _purpose_ seriously; we _intend_ vaguely: we set about that which we _purpose;_ we may delay that which we have only _intended:_ the execution of one's _purpose_ rests mostly with one's self; the fulfilment of an _intention_ depends upon circumstances: a man of a resolute temper is not to be diverted from his purpose by trifling objects: we may be disappointed in our _intentions_ by a variety of unforeseen but uncontrollable events. _Purpose_ is always applied to some proximate or definite object; _intend_, to that which is indefinite or remote. _Mean_, which is a term altogether of colloquial use, differs but little from _intend_, except that it is used for matters requiring but little thought; to _mean_ is simply to have in the mind, to _intend_ is to stretch with the mind to a thing.  
_Design_ and _purpose_ are taken sometimes in the abstract sense; _intend_ and _mean_, always in connection with the agent who _intends_ or _means:_ we see a _design_ in the whole creation which leads us to reflect on the wisdom and goodness of the Creator; whenever we see anything done, we are led to inquire the _purpose_ for which it is done; or are desirous of knowing the _intention_ of the person in so doing: things are said to be done with a _design_, in opposition to that which happens by chance; they are said to be done for a _purpose_ in reference to the immediate _purpose_ which is expected to result from them. _Design_, when not expressly qualified by a contrary epithet, is used in a bad sense in connection with a particular agent; _purpose, intention_, and _meaning_, taken absolutely, have an indifferent sense: a _designing_ person is full of latent and interested _designs;_ there is nothing so good that it may not be made to serve the _purposes_ of those who are bad; the _intentions_ of a man must always be taken into the account when we are forming an estimate of his actions: ignorant people frequently _mean_ much better than they do.  
**DESIGN, PLAN, SCHEME, PROJECT.** — _Design_ (see preceding). _Plan_, in French _plan_, comes from Latin _planus_, smooth or even, signifying a drawing on a flat surface, a preliminary drawing of something to be constructed. _Scheme_, in Latin _schema_, Greek _σχήμα_, a form or figure, signifies the thing drawn out in the mind. _Project_, in Latin _projectus_, from _projicio_, compounded of _pro_ and _jacio_, signifies to cast or put forth something, hence to propose.  
Arrangement is the idea common to those terms: the _design_ includes the thing that is to be brought about; the _plan_ includes the means by which it is to be brought about: a _design_ was formed in the time of James I. for overturning the government of the country; the _plan_ by which this was to have been realized consisted in placing gunpowder under the Parliament House and blowing up the assembly. A _design_ is to be estimated according to its intrinsic worth; a _plan_ is to be estimated according to its relative value, or fitness for the _design:_ a _design_ is noble or wicked, a _plan_ is practicable; every founder of a charitable institution may be supposed to have a good _design;_ but he may adopt an erroneous _plan_ for obtaining the end proposed.  
_Scheme_ and _project_ respect both the end and the means, which makes them analogous to _design_ and _plan:_ the _design_ stimulates to action; the _plan_ determines the mode of action; the _scheme_ and _project_ consist most in speculation: the _design_ and _plan_ are equally practical, and suited to the ordinary and immediate circumstances of life; the _scheme_ and _project_ are contrived or conceived for extraordinary or rare occasions: no man takes any step without a _design;_ a general forms the _plan_ of his campaign; adventurous men are always forming _schemes_ for gaining money; ambitious monarchs are full of _projects_ for increasing their dominions. _Scheme_ and _project_ differ principally in the magnitude of the objects to which they are applied, the former being much less vast and extensive than the latter: a _scheme_ may be formed by an individual for attaining any trifling advantage; _projects_ are mostly conceived in matters of great moment involving deep interests.

####desire 
**DESIRE, WISH, LONG FOE, HANKER AFTER, COVET.**  
_Desire_, in Latin _desidero_, is a word of obscure origin; it may be allied to _sidus_, star, like _consider_, which see. _Wish_ is derived from a Germanic root which is derived from the Aryan root whence the word _win_, and Latin _ven_, in _Venus, venerate_, etc., are also drawn. _Long_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _langian_, to crave or desire. _Hanker_ signifies to hang on an object with one's mind. _Covet_ (see **covetous** under [covetousness](entry://covetousness)).  
_Desire_ is imperious, it demands gratification; _wish_ is less vehement, it consists of a strong inclination; _longing_ is an impatient and continued species of _desire; hankering_ is a _desire_ for that which is set out of one's reach; _coveting_ is a _desire_ for that which belongs to another, or what it is in his power to grant: we _desire_ or _long for_ that which is near at hand or within view; we _wish_ for and _covet_ that which is more remote or less distinctly seen; we _hanker after_ that which has been once enjoyed: a discontented person _wishes_ for more than he has; he who is in a strange land _longs_ to see his native country; vicious men _hanker after_ the pleasures which are denied them; ambitious men _covet_ honors, avaricious men _covet_ riches. _Desires_ ought to be moderated, _wishes_ to be limited, _longings, hankerings_, and _covetings_ to be suppressed: uncontrolled _desires_ become the greatest torments; unbounded _wishes_ are the bane of all happiness; ardent _longings_ are mostly irrational and not entitled to indulgence; _coveting_ is expressly prohibited by the Divine law.  
_Desire_, as it regards others, is not less imperative than when it respects ourselves; it lays an obligation on the person to whom it is expressed: a _wish_ is gentle and unassuming; it appeals to the good-nature of another: we act by the _desire_ of a superior or of one who has a right to ask; we act according to the _wishes_ of an equal, or of one who can only request: the _desire_ of a parent will amount to a command in the mind of a dutiful child: his _wishes_ will be anticipated by the warmth of affection.

####desist 
**DESIST, LEAVE OFF.**  
_Desist_, from the Latin _desistere_, signifies to take one's self off. _Desist_ is applied to actions good, indifferent, or offensive to some person; _leave off_, to actions that are indifferent; the former is voluntary or involuntary, the latter voluntary: we are frequently obliged to _desist;_ but we _leave off_ at our option: it is prudent to _desist_ from using our endeavors when we find them ineffectual; it is natural for a person to _leave off_ when he sees no further occasion to continue his labor: he who annoys another must be made to _desist;_ he who does not wish to offend will _leave off_ when requested.

####despair 
**DESPAIR, DESPERATION, DESPONDENCY.**  
_Despair, desperation_, from the French _désespoir_, compounded of the privative _de_ and the Latin _spes_, hope, signifies the absence or the annihilation of all hope. _Despondency_, from _despond_, in Latin _despondeo_, compounded of the privative _de_ and _spondere_, to promise, signifies literally to deprive in a solemn manner, or cut off from every gleam of hope.  
_Despair_ is a state of mind produced by the view of external circumstances; _desperation_ and _despondency_ may be the fruit of the imagination; the former, therefore, always rests on some ground, the latter are sometimes ideal: _despair_ lies mostly in reflection; _desperation_ and _despondency_ in the feelings: the former marks a state of vehement and impatient feeling, the latter that of fallen and mournful feeling. _Despair_ is often the forerunner of _desperation_ and _despondency_, but it is not necessarily accompanied with effects so powerful: the strongest mind may have occasion to _despair_ when circumstances warrant the sentiment; men of an impetuous character are apt to run into a state of _desperation;_ a weak mind full of morbid sensibility is most liable to fall into _despondency. Despair_ interrupts or checks exertion; _desperation_ impels greater exertions; _despondency_ unfits for exertion: when a physician _despairs_ of making a cure, he lays aside the application of remedies; when a soldier sees nothing but death or disgrace before him, he is driven to _desperation_, and redoubles his efforts; when a tradesman sees before him nothing but failure for the present and want for the future he may sink into _despondency: despair_ is justifiable as far as it is a rational calculation into futurity from present appearances; _desperation_ may arise from extraordinary circumstances or the action of strong passions; in the former case it is unavoidable, and may serve to rescue from great distress; in the latter case it is mostly attended with fatal consequences: _despondency_ is a disease of the mind, which nothing but a firm trust in the goodness of Providence can obviate.  
**DESPERATE, HOPELESS.** — _Desperate_ (see above) is applicable to persons or things; _hopeless_ to things only: a person makes a _desperate_ effort; he undertakes a _hopeless_ task. _Desperate_, when applied to things, expresses more than _hopeless;_ the latter marks the absence of hope as to the attainment of good, the former marks the absence of hope as to the removal of an evil: a person who is in a _desperate_ condition is overwhelmed with actual trouble for the present and the prospect of its continuance for the future; he whose case is _hopeless_ is without the prospect of effecting the end he has in view: gamesters are frequently brought into _desperate_ situations when bereft of everything that might possibly serve to lighten the burdens of their misfortunes: it is a _hopeless_ undertaking to endeavor to reclaim men who have plunged themselves deep into the labyrinths of vice.

####destiny 
**DESTINY, FATE, LOT, DOOM.**  
_Destiny_, from _destine_ (see [appoint](entry://appoint)) signifies either the power that _destines_ or the thing _destined. Fate_ (see [chance](entry://chance)). _Lot_, Anglo-Saxon _Mat_, signifies a ticket, die, or any other thing by which the casual distribution of things is determined; and, in an extended sense, it expresses the portion thus assigned by chance. _Doom_ comes from a Teutonic root meaning that which is put up or set up — irrevocably decreed and established.  
All these terms are employed with regard to human events which are not under one's control: among the heathens _destiny_ and _fate_ were considered as deities, who each in his way could direct human affairs and were both superior even to Jupiter himself: the _Destinies_, or Parcæ, as they were termed, presided only over life and death; but _Fate_ was employed in ruling the general affairs of men. Since revelation has instructed mankind in the nature and attributes of the true God, those blind powers are now not acknowledged to exist in the overruling providence of an all-wise and an all-good Being; the terms _destiny_ and _fate_, therefore, have now only a relative sense as to what happens without the will or control of man.  
_Destiny_ is used in regard to one's station and walk in life; _fate_, in regard to what one suffers; _lot_, in regard to what one gets or possesses; and _doom_ to the final _destiny_ which terminates unhappily and depends mostly upon the will of another: _destiny_ is marked out; _fate_ is fixed; a _lot_ is assigned; a _doom_ is passed. It is the _destiny_ of some men to be always changing their plan of life; it is but too frequently the _fate_ of authors to labor for the benefit of mankind and to reap nothing for themselves but poverty and neglect; it is the _lot_ of but very few to enjoy what they themselves consider a competency; a man sometimes seals his own _doom_ by his imprudence or vices.  
**DESTINY, DESTINATION.** — Both _destiny_ and _destination_ are used for the thing _destined;_ but the former is said in relation to a man's important concerns, the latter only of particular circumstances; in which sense it may likewise be employed for the act of _destining. Destiny_ is the point or line marked out in the walk of life; _destination_ is the place fixed upon in particular: as every man has his peculiar _destiny_, so every traveller has his particular _destination. Destiny_ is altogether set above human control; no man can determine, though he may influence, the _destiny_ of another: _destination_ is, however, the specific act of an individual, either for himself or another: we leave the _destiny_ of a man to develop itself; but we may inquire about his own _destination_ or that of his children: it is a consoling reflection that the _destinies_ of short-sighted mortals like ourselves are in the hands of One who both can and will overrule them to our advantage if we place full reliance in Him; in the _destination_ of children for their several professions or callings, it is of importance to consult their particular turn of mind as well as inclination. 

####destitute 
See [bare](entry://bare); [forsaken](entry://forsaken)

####destroy 
**DESTROY, CONSUME, WASTE.**  
_Destroy_, in Latin _destruo_, from _de_, privative, and _struere_, to build, is to undo that which has been built or done. _Consume_, in French _consumer_, Latin _consume, i.e., con_ or _cum_, together, and _sumere_, to take, signifies to take away altogether. _Waste_ comes from Latin _vastus_, desolate, English _waste_, and signifies to make desolate.  
To _destroy_ is to reduce to nothing that which has been artificially raised or formed; as to _destroy_ a town or a house: to _consume_ is to use up; as to _consume_ food, or to _consume_ articles of manufacture: to _destroy_ is an immediate act mostly of violence; _consume_ is a gradual and natural process, as oil is _consumed_ in a lamp.  
To _destroy_ is always taken in the bad sense for putting an end to that which one wishes to preserve; _consume_ is also taken in a similar sense, but with the above distinction as to the mode of the action: as a hurricane _destroys_ the crops; rust _consumes_ iron: to _waste_ is to _consume_ by a misuse; as to _waste_ provisions by throwing them away or suffering them to spoil; or to fall away or lose its substance, as the body _wastes_ from disease.  
In the figurative application they are used with precisely the same distinction: happiness or peace is _destroyed;_ time is _consumed_ in an indifferent sense; time or strength is _wasted_ in the bad sense.

####destruction 
**DESTRUCTION, RUIN.**  
_Destruction_, from _destroy_, and the Latin _destruo_, signifies literally to unbuild that which is raised up. _Ruin_, from the Latin _ruere_, to fall, signifies that which is fallen into pieces.  
_Destruction_ is an act of immediate violence; _ruin_ is a gradual process; a thing is _destroyed_ by some external action upon it; a thing falls to _ruin_ of itself: we witness _destruction_ wherever war or the adverse elements rage; we witness _ruin_ whenever the works of man are exposed to the effects of time; nevertheless, if _destruction_ be more forcible and rapid, _ruin_ is, on the other hand, more sure and complete: what is _destroyed_ may be rebuilt or replaced; but what is _ruined_ is mostly lost forever, it is past recovery: when houses or towns are _destroyed_, fresh ones rise up in their place; but when commerce is _ruined_ it seldom returns to its old course. _Destruction_ admits of various degrees; _ruin_ is something positive and general. The property of a man may be _destroyed_ to a greater or less extent without necessarily involving his _ruin._ The _ruin_ of a whole family is oftentimes the consequence of _destruction_ by fire. Health is _destroyed_ by violent exercises or some other active cause; it is _ruined_ by a course of imprudent conduct. The happiness of a family is _destroyed_ by broils and discord; the morals of a young man are _ruined_ by a continued intercourse with vicious companions.  
Both words are used figuratively with the same distinction. The _destruction_ of both body and soul is the consequence of sin; the _ruin_ of a man, whether in his temporal or spiritual concerns, is inevitable if he follow the dictates of misguided passion.  
**DESTRUCTIVE, RUINOUS, PERNICIOUS.** — _Destructive_ signifies producing _destruction. Ruinous_ signifies either having or causing _ruin. Pernicious_, from the Latin _pernicies_, or _per_, intensive, and stem _neci_ of _nex_, slaughter, signifies causing violent and total dissolution.  
_Destructive_ and _ruinous_, as the epithets of the preceding terms, have a similar distinction in their sense and application; fire and sword are _destructive_ things; a poison is _destructive:_ consequences are _ruinous;_ a condition or state is _ruinous;_ intestine commotions are _ruinous_ to the prosperity of a state. _Pernicious_ approaches nearer to _destructive_ than to _ruinous;_ both the former imply a tendency to produce dissolution, which may be more or less gradual; but the latter refers us to the result itself, to the _dissolution_ as already having taken place: hence we speak of the instrument or cause as being _destructive_ or _pernicious_, and the action, event, or result as _ruinous: destructive_ is applied in the most extended sense to every object which has been created or supposed to be so; _pernicious_ is applicable only to such objects as act only in a limited way: sin is equally _destructive_ to both body and soul; certain food is _pernicious_ to the body; certain books are _pernicious_ to the mind.

####detect 
**DETECT, DISCOVER.**  
_Detect_, from the Latin _de_, privative, and _tegere_, to cover, and _discover_, from the privative _dis_ and _cover_, both originally signify to deprive of a covering; see [cover](entry://cover).  
_Detect_ is always taken in a bad sense: _discover_ in an indifferent sense. A person is _detected_ in what he wishes to conceal; a person or a thing is _discovered_ that has unintentionally lain concealed. Thieves are _detected_ in picking pockets; a lost child is _discovered_ in a wood or in some place of security. _Detection_ is the act of the moment; it relates to that which is passing: a _discovery_ is either a gradual or an immediate act, and may be made of that which has long since passed. A plot is _detected_ by any one who communicates what he has seen and heard; many murders have been _discovered_ after a lapse of years by ways the most extraordinary.

####deter 
**DETER, DISCOURAGE, DISHEARTEN.**  
_Deter_, in Latin _deterreo_, compounded of _de_ and _terrere_, signifies to frighten away from a thing. _Discourage_ and _dishearten_, by the privative _dis_, signify to deprive of courage or heart. One is _deterred_ from commencing anything; one is _discouraged_ or _disheartened_ from proceeding. A variety of motives may _deter_ any one from an undertaking; but a person is _discouraged_ or _disheartened_ mostly by the want of success or the hopelessness of the case. The prudent and the fearful are alike easily to be _deterred;_ impatient people are most apt to be _discouraged;_ faint-hearted people are easily _disheartened._ The foolhardy and the obdurate are the least easily _deterred_ from their object; the persevering will not suffer themselves to be _discouraged_ by particular failures; the resolute and self-confident will not be _disheartened_ by trifling difficulties. 

####deteriorate

####determine 
**DETERMINE, RESOLVE.**  
To _determine_ (see [decide](entry://decide)) is more especially an act of the judgment; to _resolve_ (see [courage](entry://courage)) is an act of the will: we _determine_ how or what we shall do; this requires examination and choice: we _resolve_ that we will do what we have _determined_ upon; this requires a firm spirit. Our _determinations_ should be prudent, that they may not cause repentance; our _resolutions_ should be fixed, in order to prevent variation. There can be no co-operation with a man who is _undetermined;_ it will be dangerous to co-operate with a man who is _irresolute._ In the ordinary concerns of life we have frequent occasions to _determine_ without _resolving;_ in the discharge of our moral duties, or the performance of any office, we have occasion to _resolve_ without _determining._ A master _determines_ to dismiss his servant; the servant _resolves_ on becoming more diligent. Personal convenience or necessity gives rise to the _determination;_ a sense of duty, honor, fidelity, and the like gives birth to the _resolution._ A traveller _determines_ to take a certain route; a learner _resolves_ to conquer every difficulty in the acquirement of learning. Humor or change of circumstances occasions a person to alter his _determination;_ timidity, fear, or defect in principle occasions the _resolution to waver._ Children are not capable of _determining;_ and their best _resolutions_ fall before the gratification of the moment.  
In matters of knowledge, to _determine_ is to fix the mind, or to cause it to rest in a certain opinion; to _resolve_ is to lay open what is obscure, to clear the mind from doubt and hesitation. We _determine_ points of question; we _resolve_ difficulties. It is more difficult to _determine_ in matters of rank or precedence than in cases where the solid and real interests of men are concerned; it is the business of the teacher to _resolve_ the difficulties which are proposed by the scholar. Every point is not proved which is _determined_, nor is every difficulty _resolved_ which is answered.

####deviate 
**DEVIATE, WANDER, SWERVE, STRAY.**  
_Deviate_, from _devious_, and the Latin _de viâ_, signifies, literally, to run out of the way. _Wander_ is a frequentative of _wend_ and is connected with Anglo-Saxon _windan_, to wind; it meant originally to keep winding in and out — indicating a purposeless going. For the derivation of _swerve_ see [deflect](entry://deflect). _Stray_ comes from Old French _estraier_, to wander out into the streets, from Latin _strata_, street, whence our word _street_ is derived.  
_Deviate_ always supposes a direct path which is departed from; _wander_ includes no such idea. The act of _deviating_ is commonly faulty, that of _wandering_ is different: they may frequently exchange significations; the former being justifiable by necessity, and the latter arising from an unsteadiness of mind. _Deviate_ is mostly used in the moral acceptation; _wander_ may be used in either sense. A person _deviates_ from any plan or rule laid down; he _wanders_ from the subject in which he is engaged. As no rule can be laid down which will not admit of an exception, it is impossible but the wisest will find it necessary in their moral conduct to _deviate_ occasionally; yet every wanton _deviation_ from an established practice evinces a culpable temper on the part of the _de-viator._ Those who _wander_ into the regions of metaphysics are in great danger of losing themselves; it is with them as with most _wanderers_, that they spend their time at best but idly.

####devil 
**DEVIL, DEMON.**  
_Devil_, in Anglo-Saxon _deofal_, French _diable_, etc., is connected with the Greek _διάβολος_, from _διάβάλλειν_, to traduce, literally to throw something at another (cf. the slang phrase to "sling mud" for meaning to slander). It signifies properly a calumniator, and is always taken in the bad sense for the spirit which incites to evil and tempts men through the medium of their evil passion. _Demon_, in Latin _dœmon_, Greek _δαίμων_, a being of divine nature, is taken either in a bad sense or good sense for the power that acts within us and controls our actions. Since the _devil_ is represented as the father of all wickedness, associations have been connected with the name that render its pronunciation in familiar discourse offensive to the chastened ear; it is therefore used in the grave style only.  
Among Jews and Christians the term _demon_ is always taken in a bad sense for an evil spirit generally; but the Greeks and Romans understood by the word _dœmon_ any genius or spirit, but particularly the good spirit or guardian angel who was supposed to accompany a man from his birth. Socrates professed to be always under the direction of such a _dœmon_, who is alluded to very much by the ancients in their writings and on their medals; hence it is that in figurative language the word may still be used in a good sense.  
In general, the word is taken for an evil spirit, as the _demon_ of discord. 

####devise 
**DEVISE, BEQUEATH.**  
_Devise_, compounded of _de_ and _visits_, participle of _videre_, to see or show, signifies to point out specifically. _Bequeath_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _becwethan_, from _cwethan_, to say (whence _quoth)_, and means to give over to a person by saying or by word of mouth.  
In the technical sense, to _devise_ is to give lands by a will duly attested according to law; to _bequeath_ is to give personality after one's death by a less formal instrument; whence the term _bequeath_ may also be used figuratively, as to _bequeath_ one's name to posterity.

####diabolic 
**DIABOLIC, DEVILISH, FIENDISH, SATANIC.**  
These words all mean resembling the devil or the powers of evil, and differ very little in meaning. _Devilish_ and _diabolical_ both come ultimately from Greek _διάβολος_, devil, literally slanderer, hater. _Fiendish_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _feond_, an enemy, from _feogan_, to hate. _Satanic_ comes originally from the Hebrew designation of the "Prince of the Powers of Darkness, " which meant "Adversary. " All the words signify the highest degree of wickedness and maliciousness, characteristic of the opponent of all good. Though _devilish_ and _diabolical_ have the same derivation, _devilish_ has been so largely and carelessly used in colloquial speech to signify anything unpleasant that it has somewhat lost its force and dignity; _diabolical_ expresses more definitely the idea of resemblance to the devil with special reference to malicious skill and ingenuity. _Fiendish_ has the same meaning with special emphasis on malignity and cruelty. _Satanic_ means characteristic of Satan, the prince of devils, and sometimes has special reference to size and daring in malignant action, or to Satan's distinguishing characteristic of pride. However, the words are really well-nigh interchangeable.

####diaphanous 
**DIAPHANOUS, CLEAR, PELLUCID, TRANSLUCENT.**  
_Diaphanous_, in French _diaphane_, from the Greek _διάφανης_, that a compound of _διά_, through, and _φαίνειν_, to show, pertains to that which permits light to pass through or has the quality of transmitting light. _Clear_ and _pellucid_ apply to substances, as air and water, when free from anything that would obstruct a view through them; but _diaphanous_ implies a _translucent_ quality in distinction from a _transparent_ one. A substance is _translucent_ that permits rays of light to pass through it without rendering the form or color of objects on the other side distinguishable; hence so nearly opaque that objects are scarcely, if at all, visible through it; while _transparent_ applies to a substance that can be seen through clearly or allows light to pass through without diminution. A _diaphanous_ substance, therefore, is _translucent_ or only partially _transparent. Translucency_ implies that property of certain minerals, as well as other substances, which permits light to pass through them, but in a subdued degree. _Diaphanous_ has been of late especially applied to semi-transparent textures such as lace and chiffon. There is nothing in the history of the word to support such a limitation of its meaning, but this is its most frequent application. A veil is _diaphanous;_ a piece of smoked glass for viewing the sun and spectacles worn by people motoring or exposed to strong light are _translucent;_ window-glass is _transparent._

####dictate 
**DICTATE, PRESCRIBE.**  
_Dictate_, from the Latin _dictatus_ and _dictum_, a word, signifies to make a word for another; and _prescribe_ literally signifies to write down for another (see [appoint](entry://appoint)), in which sense the former of these terms is used technically for a principal who gets his secretary to write down his words as he utters them; and the latter for a physician who writes down for his patient what he wishes him to take as a remedy.  
They are used figuratively for a species of counsel given by a superior; to _dictate_ is, however, a greater exercise of authority than to _prescribe._ To _dictate_ amounts even to more than to command; it signifies commanding with a tone of unwarrantable authority, or still oftener a species of commanding by those who have no right to command; it is therefore mostly taken in a bad sense. To _prescribe_ partakes altogether of the nature of counsel, and nothing of command; it serves as a rule to the person _prescribed_, and is justified by the superior wisdom and knowledge of the person _prescribing_; it is therefore always taken in an indifferent or a good sense. He who _dictates_ speaks with an adventitious authority; he who _prescribes_ has the sanction of reason. To _dictate_ implies an entire subserviency in the person _dictated_ to; to _prescribe_ carries its own weight with it in the nature of the thing _prescribed._ Upstarts are ready to _dictate_ even to their superiors on every occasion that offers; modest people are often fearful of giving advice lest they should be suspected of _prescribing._  
**DICTATE, SUGGESTION.** — _Dictate_ signifies the thing _dictated_, and has an imperative sense, as in the former case. _Suggestion_ signifies the thing _suggested_, and conveys the idea of its being proposed secretly or in a gentle manner.  
These terms are both applied with this distinction to acts of the mind. When conscience, reason, or passion presents anything forcibly to the mind, it is called a _dictate;_ when anything enters the mind in a casual manner, it is called a _suggestion._ The _dictate_ is obeyed or yielded to; the _suggestion_ is followed or listened to. It is the part of a Christian at all times to obey the _dictates_ of reason. He who yields to the _dictates_ of passion renounces the character of a rational being. It is the characteristic of a weak mind to follow the _suggestions_ of envy.  
_Dictate_ is employed only for what passes inwardly; _suggestion_ may be used for any action on the mind by external objects. No man will err essentially in the ordinary affairs of life who is guided by the _dictates_ of plain sense. It is the lot of sinful mortals to be drawn to evil by the _suggestions_ of Satan as well as their own evil inclinations. 

####diction 
**DICTION, STYLE, PHRASE, PHRASEOLOGY.**  
_Diction_, from the Latin _dictio_, saying, is put for the mode of expressing ourselves. _Style_ comes from the Latin _stylus_, the bodkin with which the Latins wrote and corrected what they had written on their waxen tablets; whence the word has been used for the manner of writing in general. _Phrase_, in Greek _φράσις_, from _φράζειν_, to speak; and _phraseology_, from _φράσις_, and _λόγος_, both signify the manner of speaking.  
_Diction_ expresses much less than _style:_ the former is applicable to the first efforts of learners in composition; the latter only to the original productions of a matured mind. Errors in grammar, false construction, a confused disposition of words, or an improper application of them constitutes bad _diction;_ but the niceties, the elegancies, the peculiarities, and the beauties of composition which mark the genius and talent of the writer are what is comprehended under the name of _style. Diction_ is a general term, applicable alike to a single sentence or a connected composition; _style_ is used in regard to a regular piece of composition. As _diction_ is a term of inferior import, it is of course mostly confined to ordinary subjects, and _style_ to the productions of authors. We should speak of a person's _diction_ in his private correspondence, but of his _style_ in his literary works. _Diction_ requires only to be pure and clear; _style_ may likewise be terse, polished, elegant, florid, poetic, sober, and the like.  
_Diction_ is said mostly in regard to what is written; _phrase_ and _phraseology_ are said as often of what is spoken as what is written; as that a person has adopted a strange _phrase_ or _phraseology._ The former respects single words; the latter comprehends a succession of _phrases._

####dictionary 
**DICTIONARY, ENCYCLOPÆDIA.**  
_Dictionary_, Late Latin _dictionarium_, from the Latin _dictum_, a saying or word, is a register of words. _Encyclopaedia_, from the Greek _έγκυκλοπαιδεία_, or _έv_, in, _κύκλος,_ a circle, and _παιδεία_, learning, signifies a book containing the whole circle of knowledge.  
The definition of words, with their various changes, modifications, uses, acceptations, and applications, are the proper subjects of a _dictionary;_ the nature and properties of things, with their construction, uses, powers, etc., are the proper subjects of an _encyclopœdia._ A general acquaintance with all arts and sciences as far as respects the use of technical terms, and a perfect acquaintance with the classical writers in the language, are essential for the composition of a _dictionary;_ an entire acquaintance with all the minutiæ of every art and science is requisite for the composition of an _encyclopœdia._ A single individual may qualify himself for the task of writing a _dictionary;_ but the universality and diversity of knowledge contained in an _encyclopœdia_ render it necessarily the work of many. The term _dictionary_ has been extended in its application to any work alphabetically arranged, as biographical, medical, botanical _dictionaries_, and the like, but still preserving this distinction, that a _dictionary_ always contains only a general or partial illustration of the subject proposed, while an _encyclopœdia_ embraces the whole circuit of science.  
**DICTIONARY, LEXICON, VOCABULARY, GLOSSARY, NOMENCLATURE.** — _Dictionary_ is a general term; _lexicon_, from _λέγειν_, to say; _vocabulary_, from _vox_, a word; _glossary_, from gloss, to explain, from _γλώσσα_, the tongue; and _nomenclature_, from _nomen_, are all species of the _dictionary. Lexicon_ is a species of _dictionary_ appropriately applied to the dead languages. A Greek or Hebrew lexicon is distinguished from a _dictionary_ of the French or English language. A _vocabulary_ is a partial kind of _dictionary_, which may comprehend a simple list of words, with or without explanation, arranged in order or otherwise. A _glossary_ is an explanatory _vocabulary_, which commonly serves to explain the obsolete terms employed in any old author. A _nomenclature_ is literally a list of names, and in particular a reference to proper names. 

####didactic 
**DIDACTIC, PEDAGOGIC.**  
_Didactic_, in Greek _διδακτικός_, from _διδάσκειν_, to teach, cognate with the Latin _doceo_, in French _didactique_, signifies, specifically, whatever pertains to teaching, conveying instruction, or containing precepts or rules. In the plural and substantive form the term implies the science of teaching, the best methods of systematic instruction. _Didactic poetry_ is a kind which aims, or seems to aim, at instruction, malting pleasure entirely subservient to this. The "Georgics" of Virgil have been the model according to which such poems have generally been composed. _Pedagogic_ has in recent years become a more conspicuous term than _didactic_, because of the great advance in educational methods. The term is from the Greek _παιδαγωγός_, compounded of _παίς_, or _παιδ-_, a child, and _άγωγός_, leading, and originally applied to a slave who led his master's children to school and places of amusement while they were too young to go alone, and, in exceptional instances, such pedagogues acted also as teachers. Latterly the term _pedagogue_ came to be used in contempt or ridicule to designate a pedant or a supercilious instructor.  
Now _pedagogy_, the science of teaching, has become conspicuous among the learned arts, and has its special colleges with degree-granting privileges, besides the many state and municipal normal schools. 

####die 
**DIE, EXPIRE, PASS OVER.**  
_Die_ is a Scandinavian word from a Teutonic base whence _dead, death_, etc., are also derived. _Expire_, from _ex_, out, and _spirare_, to breathe, means giving up the breath of life.  
There are beings, such as trees and plants, which are said to live, although they have not breath; these _die_, but do not _expire;_ there are other beings which absorb and emit air, but do not live; such as the flame of a lamp which does not _die_, but it _expires._ By a natural metaphor, the time of being is put for the life of objects; and hence we speak of the date _expiring_, the term _expiring_, and the like; and as life is applied figuratively to moral objects, so may death to objects not having physical life.  
To _pass over_ is the Christian Science equivalent for _to die._

####differ 
**DIFFER, VARY, DISAGREE, DISSENT.**  
_Differ_, in Latin _differο_, or _dis_, apart, and _ferre_, to bear, signifies to make into two. _Vary_ (see [change](entry://change)). _Disagree_ is literally not to _agree. Dissent_, in Latin _dissentio_, or _dis_ and _sentire_, to think or feel, signifies to think or feel apart or differently.  
_Differ, vary_, and _disagree_ are applicable either to persons or things; _dissent_ to persons only. First as to persons: to _differ_ is the most general and indefinite term, the rest are but modes of _difference:_ we may _differ_ from any cause, or in any degree, we _vary_ only in small matters: thus persons may _differ_ or _vary_ in their statements. There must be two at least to _differ_, and there may be an indefinite number: one may _vary_, or an indefinite number may _vary;_ thus two or more may _differ_ in an account which they give; one person may _vary_ at different times in the account which he gives. To _differ_ may be either in fact or matters of speculation; to _disagree_, mostly in matters of practice or personal interest; to _dissent_, mostly in matters of speculation or opinion. Philosophers may _differ_ in accounting for any phenomenon; politicians may _differ_ as to the conduct of public affairs; people may _disagree_ who have to act together; a person may _dissent_ from any opinion which is offered or prescribed.  
_Differences_ may occasion discordant feeling or otherwise, according to the nature of the difference. _Differences_ in regard to claims or matters of interest are rarely unaccompanied with some asperity. _Disagreements, variances_, and _dissensions_ are always accompanied with more or less ill-humor or ill-feeling. _Disagreements_ between those who ought to _agree_ and to co-operate are mostly occasioned by opposing passions; _variance_ is said of whatever disturbs the harmony of those who ought to live in love and harmony. _Dissensions_ arise not merely from diversity of opinion, but also from diversity of interest, and always produce much acrimony of feeling. They arise mostly among bodies of men.  
In regard to things, _differ_ is said of two things with respect to each other; _vary_ of one thing in respect to itself: thus two tempers _differ_ from each other, and a person's temper _varies_ from time to time. Things _differ_ in then essences, they _vary_ in their accidents; thus the genera and species of things _differ_ from each other, and the individuals of each species _vary: differ_ is said of everything promiscuously, but _disagree_ is only said of such things as might agree; thus two trees _differ_ from each other by the course of things, but two numbers _disagree_ which are intended to agree.  
**DIFFERENCE, VARIETY, DIVERSITY, MEDLEY.** — _Difference_ signifies the cause or the act of differing. _Variety_, from _various_ or _vary_, in Latin _varius_, different, signifies a continual difference. _Diversity_, in Latin _diversitas_, comes from _diverto_, compounded of _dis_, apart, and _vertere_, to turn, and signifies to turn asunder. _Medley_ has the same derivation as _middle_, for which see _intermeddle_ under INTERCEDE.  
_Difference_ and _variety_ seem to lie in the things themselves; _diversity_ and _medley_ are created either by accident or design; a _difference_ may lie in two objects only; a _variety_ cannot exist without an assemblage: a _difference_ is discovered by means of a comparison which the mind forms of objects to prevent confusion; _variety_ strikes on the mind and pleases the imagination with many agreeable images; it is opposed to dull uniformity: the acute observer traces _differences_, however minute, in the objects of his research, and by this means is enabled to class them under their general or particular heads; nature affords such an infinite _variety_ in everything which exists that if we do not perceive it the fault is in ourselves.  
_Diversity_ arises from an assemblage of objects naturally contrasted; a _medley_ is produced by an assemblage of objects so ill suited as to produce a ludicrous effect. _Diversity_ exists in the tastes or opinions of men; a _medley_ is produced by the concurrence of such tastes or opinions as can in no wise coalesce. A _diversity_ of sounds heard at a suitable distance in the stillness of the evening will have an agreeable effect on the ear; a _medley_ of noises, whether heard near or at a distance, must always be harsh and offensive.  
**DIFFERENCE, DISTINCTION.** — _Difference_ lies in the thing; _distinction_ is the act of the person: the former is, therefore, to the latter as the cause to the effect; the _distinction_ rests on the _difference:_ those are equally bad logicians who make a _distinction_ without a _difference_, or who make no _distinction_ where there is a _difference._  
Sometimes _distinction_ is put for the ground of _distinction_, which brings it nearer in sense to _difference_, in which case the former is a species of the latter: a _difference_ is either external or internal: a _distinction_ is always external, the former lies in the thing, the latter is designedly made: we have _differences_ in character and _distinctions_ in dress; the _difference_ between profession and practice, though very considerable, is often lost sight of by the professors of Christianity; in the sight of God there is no rank or _distinction_ that will screen a man from the consequences of unrepented sins.  
**DIFFERENCE, DISPUTE, ALTERCATION, QUARREL.** — _Difference_ (see [differ](entry://differ)). _Dispute_ (see [argue](entry://argue)). _Altercation_, in Latin _altercatio_, from _alter_, the other of two people, signifies to dispute in turns, first one speaking and then the other — suggesting also a decided difference of opinion. _Quarrel_, in French _querelle_, from the Latin _queri_, to complain, signifies having a complaint against another.  
All these terms are here taken in the general sense of a _difference_ on some personal question; the term _difference_ is here as general and indefinite as in the former case: a _difference_, as distinguished from the others, is generally of a less serious and personal kind; a _dispute_ consists not only of angry words, but much ill blood and unkind offices; an _altercation_ is a wordy _dispute_, in which _difference_ of opinion is drawn out into a multitude of words on all sides; _quarrel_ is the most serious of all _differences_, which leads to every species of violence; a _difference_ may sometimes arise from a misunderstanding, which may be easily rectified; _differences_ seldom grow to _disputes_ but by the fault of both parties; _altercations_ arise mostly from pertinacious adherence to, and obstinate defence of, one's opinions; _quarrels_ mostly spring from injuries real or supposed: _differences_ subsist between men in an individual or public capacity; they may be carried on in a direct or indirect manner; _disputes_ and _altercations_ are mostly conducted in a direct manner between individuals; _quarrels_ may arise between nations or individuals, and be carried on by acts of offence directly or indirectly.  
**DIFFERENT, DISTINCT, SEPARATE.** — _Different_ (see [differ](entry://differ)). _Distinct_, in Latin _distinctus_, participle of _distinguo_, and _separate_ (see [abstract ](entry://abstract )for both).  
_Difference_ is opposed to similitude; there is no _difference_ between objects absolutely alike: _distinctness_ is opposed to identity; there can be no _distinction_ where there is only one and the same being: _separation_ is opposed to unity; there can be no _separation_ between objects that coalesce or adhere: things may be _different_ and not _distinct_, or _distinct_ and not _different: different_ is said altogether of the internal properties of things; _distinct_ is said of things as objects of vision, or as they appear either to the eye or to the mind: when two or more things are seen only as one they may be _different_, but they are not _distinct;_ but whatever is seen as two or more things, each complete in itself, is _distinct_, although it may not be _different:_ two roads are said to be _different_ which run in _different_ directions, but they may not be _distinct_ when seen on a map: on the other hand. two roads are said to be _distinct_ when they are observed as two roads to run in the same direction, but they need not in any particular to be _different:_ two stars of _different_ magnitudes may, in certain directions, appear as one, in which case they are _different_ but not _distinct;_ two books on the same subject, and by the same author, but not written in continuation of each other, are _distinct_ books, but not _different._  
What is _separate_ must in its nature be generally _distinct;_ but everything is not _separate_ which is _distinct:_ when houses are _separate_ they are obviously _distinct;_ but they may frequently be distinct when they are not positively _separated:_ the _distinct_ is marked out by some external sign which determines its beginning and its end; the _separate_ is that which is set apart and to be seen by itself: _distinct_ is a term used only in determining the singularity or plurality of objects; the _separate_ only in regard to their proximity to or distance from each other: we speak of having a _distinct_ household, but of living in _separate_ apartments; of dividing one's subject into _distinct_ heads, or of making things into _separate_ parcels: the body and soul are _different_, inasmuch as they have _different_ properties; they are _distinct_, inasmuch as they have marks by which they may be _distinguished_, and at death they will be _separate._   
**DIFFERENT, SEVERAL, DIVERS, SUNDRY, VARIOUS.** — All these terms are employed to mark a number, but _different_ is the most indefinite of all these terms, as its office is rather to define the quality than the number, and is equally applicable to few and many; it is opposed to singularity, but the other terms are employed positively to express many. _Several_, from to _sever_, signifies split or made into many; they may be either _different_ or alike: there may be _several_ different things, or _several_ things alike; but we need not say _several_ divers things, for the word _divers_ signifies properly many _different. Sundry_, from Anglo-Saxon adverb _sundor_, apart, signifies many things scattered or at a distance, whether as it regards time or space. _Various_ expresses not only a greater number, but a greater _diversity_ than all the rest.  
The same thing often affects _different_ persons _differently:_ an individual may be affected _several_ times in the same way; or particular persons may be affected at _sundry_ times and in _divers_ manners; the ways in which men are affected are so _various_ as not to admit of enumeration; it is not so much to understand _different_ languages as to understand _several different_ languages; _divers_ modes have been suggested and tried for the good education of youth, but most are of too theoretical a nature to admit of being reduced successfully to practice; an incorrect writer omits _sundry_ articles that belong to a statement; we need not wonder at the misery which is introduced into families by extravagance and luxury when we notice the infinitely _various_ allurements for spending money which are held out to the young and the thoughtless.  
**DIFFERENT, UNLIKE.** — _Different_ is positive, _unlike_ is negative: we look at what is _different_, and draw a comparison; but that which is _unlike_ needs no comparison: a thing is said to be _different_ from every other thing, or _unlike_ to anything seen before; which latter mode of expression obviously conveys less to the mind than the former. 

####difficult 
See [hard](entry://hard); [herculean](entry://herculean); [knotty](entry://knotty)

####difficulties 
**DIFFICULTIES, EMBARRASSMENTS, TROUBLES.**  
These terms are all applicable to a person's concerns in life; but _difficulties_ relate to the _difficulty_ of conducting a business; _embarrassments_ relate to the confusion attending a state of debt; and _trouble_ to the pain which is the natural consequence of not fulfilling engagements or answering demands. Of the three, the term _difficulties_ expresses the least, and that of _troubles_ the most. A young man on his entrance into the world will unavoidably experience _difficulties_ if not provided with ample means in the outset. But let his means be ever so ample, if he have not prudence and talents fitted for business he will hardly keep himself free from _embarrassments_, which are the greatest _troubles_ that can arise to disturb the peace of a man's mind.  
**DIFFICULTY, OBSTACLE, IMPEDIMENT.** — _Difficulty_, in Latin _difficultas_, and _difficilis_, compounded of the privative _dis_ and _facilis_, easy, from _facere_, to do, signifies not easy to be done. _Obstacle_, in Latin _obstaculum_, from _ob_, in the way, and _stare_, to stand, signifies the thing that stands in the way between a person and the object he has in view. _Impediment_, in Latin _impedimentum_, from _impedio_, compounded of _in_, in, and _pedes_, feet, signifies something that entangles the feet.  
All these terms include in their signification that which interferes either with the actions or views of men: the _difficulty_ lies most in the nature and circumstances of the thing itself; the _obstacle_ and _impediment_ consist of that which is external or foreign: a _difficulty_ interferes with the completion of any work; an _obstacle_ interferes with the attainment of any end; an _impediment_ interrupts the progress and prevents the execution of one's wishes: a _difficulty_ embarrasses, it suspends the powers of acting or deciding; an _obstacle_ opposes itself, it is properly met in the way, and intervenes between us and our object; an _impediment_ shackles and puts a stop to our proceedings: we speak of encountering a _difficulty_, surmounting an _obstacle_, and removing an _impediment:_ the disposition of the mind often occasions more _difficulties_ in negotiations than the subjects themselves; the eloquence of Demosthenes was the greatest _obstacle_ which Philip of Macedon experienced in his political career; ignorance of the language is the greatest _impediment_ which a foreigner experiences in the pursuit of any object out of his own country.

####diffuse 
**DIFFUSE, PROLIX.**  
Both mark defects of style opposed to brevity. _Diffuse_, in Latin _diffusus_, participle of _diffundere_, to pour out or spread wide, marks the quality of being extended in space. _Prolix_ comes from Latin _pro_, beyond, and _liquere_, to flow (whence _liquid, liquor_, etc.), and means flowing beyond bounds, overflowing.  
The _diffuse_ is properly opposed to the precise; the _prolix_ to the concise or laconic. A _diffuse_ writer is fond of amplification, he abounds in epithets, tropes, figures, and illustrations; the _prolix_ writer is fond of circumlocution, minute details, and trifling particulars. _Diffuseness_ is a fault only in degree and according to circumstances; _prolixity_ is a positive fault at all times. The former leads to the use of words unnecessarily; the latter to the use of phrases, as well as words, that are altogether useless: the _diffuse_ style has too much of repetition: the _prolix_ style abounds in tautology. _Diffuseness_ often arises from an exuberance of imagination; _prolixity_ from the want of imagination; on the other hand, the former may be coupled with great superficiality and the latter with great solidity. Modern writers have fallen into the error of _diffuseness._ Lord Clarendon and many English writers preceding him are chargeable with _prolixity._ See also [spread](entry://spread)

####digress 
**DIGRESS, DEVIATE.**  
Both in the original and the accepted sense, these words express going out of the ordinary course; but _digress_ is used only in particular, and _deviate_ in general cases. We _digress_ only in a narrative, whether written or spoken; we _deviate_ in actions as well as in words, in our conduct as well as in writings. _Digress_ is mostly taken in a good or indifferent sense, _deviate_ in an indifferent or bad sense. Although frequent _digressions_ are faulty, yet occasionally it is necessary to _digress_ for the purpose of explanation; every _deviation_ is bad which is not sanctioned by the necessity of circumstances. 

####dilate 
**DILATE, EXPAND.**  
_Dilate_, in Latin _dilato_, from _dis_, apart, and _latus_, wide, that is, to make very wide. _Expand_, in Latin _expando_, compounded of _ex_ and _pandere_, to spread, to appear or show, signifying to set forth or lay open to view by spreading out.  
The idea of drawing anything out so as to occupy a greater space is common to these terms in opposition to contracting. A bladder _dilates_ on the admission of air, or the heart _dilates_ with joy knowledge _expands_ the mind, or a person's views _expand_ with circumstances. 

####dilatory 
See [slow](entry://slow)

####diligent 
**DILIGENT, EXPEDITIOUS, PROMPT.**  
All these terms mark the quality of quickness in a commendable degree. _Diligent_, from _diligere_, to love, marks the interest one takes in doing something; he is _diligent_ who loses no time, who keeps close to the work from inclination. _Expeditious_ comes from the Latin _expedio_, from _ex_, out, and _pes, pedis_, foot, which meant originally to get one's foot out, to set off with speed. He who is _expeditious_ applies himself to no other thing that offers; he finishes everything in its turn. _Prompt_, from the Latin _promo_, to draw out or make ready, marks one's desire to get ready; he is _prompt_ who sets about a thing without delay, so as to make it ready. Idleness, dilatoriness, and slowness are the three defects opposed to these three qualities. The _diligent_ man goes to his work willingly, and applies to it assiduously; the _expeditious_ man gets it finished quickly; the _prompt_ man sets about it readily and gets it finished immediately. It is necessary to be _diligent_ in the concerns which belong to us, to be _expeditious_ in any business that requires to be terminated, to be _prompt_ in the execution of orders that are given to us.

####direct 
**DIRECT, REGULATE, DISPOSE.**  
We _direct_ for the instruction of individuals; we _regulate_ for the good order or convenience of many.  
To _direct_ is personal, it supposes authority; to _regulate_ is general, it supposes superior information. An officer _directs_ the movements of his men in military operations; the steward or master of the ceremonies _regulates_ the whole concerns of an entertainment: the _director_ is often a man in power; the _regulator_ is always the man of business; the latter is frequently employed to act under the former.  
To _direct_ is always used with regard to others; to _regulate_, frequently with regard to ourselves. One person _directs_ another according to his better judgment: he _regulates_ his own conduct by principles or circumstances.  
But sometimes the word _direct_ is taken in the sense of giving a direction to an object, and it is then distinguished from _regulate_, which signifies to determine the measure and other circumstances.  
To _dispose_, from Latin _dis_, and French _poser_, for derivation of which see [compose](entry://compose), signifying to put apart for a particular purpose, supposes superior power like _direct_, and superior wisdom like _regulate;_ whence the term has been applied to the Almighty, who is styled the Supreme _Disposer_ of events, and by the poets to the heathen deities.  
See also [conduct](entry://conduct); [straight](entry://straight)  
**DIRECTION, ADDRESS, SUPERSCRIPTION.** — _Direction_ marks that which directs. _Address_ is that which addresses. _Superscription_, from _super_, above, and _scribere_, to write, signifies that which is written over.  
Although these terms may be used promiscuously for one another, yet they have a peculiarity of signification by which their proper use is defined: a _direction_ may serve to direct to places as well as to persons: an _address_ is never used but in direct application to the person: a _superscription_ has more respect to the thing than the person. A _direction_ may be written or verbal; an _address_ in this sense is always written; a _superscription_ must not only be written, but either on or over some other thing: a _direction_ is given to such as go in search of persons and places; it ought to be clear and particular: an _address_ is put either on a card and a letter or in a book; it ought to be suitable to the station and situation of the person _addressed:_ a _superscription_ is placed at the head of other writings, or over tombs and pillars; it ought to be appropriate.  
**DIRECTION, ORDER.** — _Direction_ (see [direct](entry://direct)). _Order_ (see [command](entry://command)).  
_Direction_ contains most of instruction in it; _order_, most of authority. _Directions_ should be followed, _orders_ obeyed. It is necessary to direct those who are unable to act for themselves: it is necessary to _order_ those whose business it is to execute the _orders. Directions_ given to servants and children must be clear, simple, and precise; _orders_ to tradespeople may be particular or general. _Directions_ extend to the moral conduct of others, as well as the ordinary concerns of life; _orders_ are confined to the personal convenience of the individual. A parent _directs_ a child as to his behavior in company, or as to his conduct when he enters life; a teacher _directs_ his pupil in the choice of books, or in the distribution of his studies: the master gives _orders_ to his attendants to be in waiting for him at a certain hour; or he gives _orders_ to his tradesmen to provide what is necessary. See also [key](entry://key)  
**DIRECTLY, IMMEDIATELY, INSTANTLY, INSTANTANEOUSLY.** — _Directly_ signifies in a _direct_ or straight manner. _Immediately_ signifies without any medium or intervention. _Instantly_ and _instantaneously_, from _instant_, signifies in an instant.  
_Directly_ is most applicable to the actions of men; _immediately_ and _instantly_ to either actions or events. _Directly_ refers to the interruptions which may intentionally delay the commencement of any work; _immediately_ in general refers to the space of time that intervenes. A diligent person goes _directly_ to his work; he suffers nothing to draw him aside: good news is _immediately_ spread abroad upon its arrival; nothing intervenes to retard it. _Immediately_ and _instantly_, or _instantaneously_, both mark a quick succession of events, but the latter in a much stronger degree than the former. _Immediately_ is negative; it expresses simply that nothing intervenes; _instantly_ is positive, signifying the very existing moment in which the thing happens. A person who is of a willing disposition goes or runs _immediately_ to the assistance of another; but the ardor of affection impels him to fly _instantly_ to his relief, as he sees the danger. A surgeon does not proceed _directly_ to dress a wound: he first examines it in order to ascertain its nature: men of lively minds _immediately_ see the source of their own errors: people of delicate feelings are _instantly_ alive to the slightest breach of decorum. A course of proceeding is _direct_, the consequences are _immediate_, and the effects _instantaneous._

####disadvantage 
**DISADVANTAGE, INJURY, HURT, DETRIMENT, PREJUDICE.**  
_Disadvantage_ implies the absence of an _advantage_, which see. _Injury_, in Latin _injuria_, from _in_, not, and _jus, juris_, right, properly signifies what is contrary to right or justice, but extends in its sense to every loss or deficiency which is occasioned. _Hurt_, Middle English _hurten_, from Old French _hurter_, meant to strike or dash against, hence to injure. _Detriment_, in Latin _detrimentum_, from _detritum_ and _deterrere_, to wear away, signifies the effect of being worn out. _Prejudice_, in the improper sense of the word (see [bias](entry://bias)), implies the ill which is supposed to result from _prejudice. Disadvantage_ is rather the absence of a good; _injury_ is a positive evil: the want of education may frequently be a _disadvantage_ to a person by retarding his advancement; the ill word of another may be an _injury_ by depriving him of friends. _Disadvantage_, therefore, is applied to such things as are of of an _adventitious_ nature: the _injury_, to that which is of essential importance.  
_Hurt, detriment_, and _prejudice_ are all species of _injuries. Injury_, in general, implies whatever ill befalls an object by the external action of other objects, whether taken in relation to physical or moral evil, to persons or to things; _hurt_ is that species of _injury_ which is produced by more direct violence; too close an application to study is _injurious_ to the health; reading by an improper light is _hurtful_ to the eyes; so in a moral sense, the light reading which a circulating library supplies is often _injurious_ to the morals of young people; all violent affections are _hurtful_ to the mind.  
_Detriment_ and _prejudice_ are species of _injury_ which affect only the outward circumstances of a person or thing, the former implying what may lessen the value of an object, the latter what may lower it in the esteem of others. Whatever affecta the stability of a merchant's credit is highly _detrimental_ to his interests: whatever is _prejudicial_ to the character of a man should not be made the subject of indiscriminate conversation. 

####disaffection 
**DISAFFECTION, DISLOYALTY.**  
_Disaffection_ is general: _disloyalty_ is particular; it is a species of _disaffection._ Men are _disaffected_ to the government, _disloyal_ to their prince. _Disaffection_ may be said with regard to any form of government; _disloyalty_, only with regard to monarchy. Although both terms are commonly employed in a bad sense, yet the former does not always convey the unfavorable meaning which is attached to the latter. A man may have reasons to think himself justified in _disaffection_, but he will never attempt to offer anything in justification of _disloyalty._ A usurped government will have many _disaffected_ subjects with whom it must deal leniently; the best king may have _disloyal_ subjects, upon whom he must exercise the rigor of the law. Many were _disaffected_ to the usurpation of Oliver Cromwell, because they would not be _disloyal_ to their king. 

####disagree 
See [differ](entry://differ)

####disappear 
**DISAPPEAR, VANISH.**  
To _disappear_ signifies not to _appear_ (see [air](entry://air)). _Vanish_, in French _évanouir_, Latin _evaneo_ or _evanesco_, compounded of _e_ and _vanescere_, to become empty, from _vanus_, empty, signifies to go out of sight.  
To _disappear_ comprehends no particular mode of action; to _vanish_ includes in it the idea of a rapid motion. A thing _disappears_ either gradually or suddenly; it _vanishes_ on a sudden; it _disappears_ in the ordinary course of things; it _vanishes_ by an unusual effort, a supernatural or a magic power. Any object that recedes or moves away will soon _disappear;_ in fairy tales things are made to _vanish_ the instant they are beheld. To _disappear_ is often a temporary action; to _vanish_ generally conveys the idea of being permanently lost to the sight. The stars _appear_ and _disappear_ in the firmament; lightning _vanishes_ with a rapidity that is unequalled.

####disapprove 
**DISAPPROVE, DISLIKE.**  
To _disapprove_ is not to approve, or to think not good. To _dislike_ is not to like, or to find unlike or unsuitable to one's wishes.  
_Disapprove_ is an act of the judgment; _dislike_ is an act of the will or the affection. To _approve_ or _disapprove_ is peculiarly the part of a superior, or one who determines the conduct of others; to _dislike_ is altogether a personal act, in which the feelings of the individual are consulted. It is a misuse of the judgment to _disapprove_ where we need only _dislike;_ it is a perversion of the judgment to _disapprove_ because we _dislike._

####disaster 
See [calamity](entry://calamity)

####disavow 
**DISAVOW, DENY, DISOWN.**  
To _disavow_, from _dis_ and _avow_ (see [acknowledge](entry://acknowledge)), is to avow that a thing is not: _deny_ is to assert that a thing is not: _disown_, from _dis_ and _own_, is to assert that a person or thing is not one's own or does not belong to one. A _disavowal_ is a general declaration; a _denial_ is a particular assertion; the former is made voluntarily and unasked for, the latter is always in direct answer to a charge: we _disavow_ in matters of general interest where truth only is concerned; we _deny_ in matters of personal interest where the character or feelings are implicated. What is _disavowed_ is generally in support of truth; what is _denied_ may often be in direct violation of truth: an honest mind will always _disavow_ whatever has been erroneously attributed to it; a timid person sometimes _denies_ what he knows to be true from a fear of the consequences.  
_Deny_ is said of things that concern others as well as ourselves; _disown_ only of things in which one is personally concerned or supposed to be so. _Denial_ is employed for events or indifferent matters; _disowning_ extends to whatever one can own or possess: a person _denies_ that there is any truth in the assertion of another; he _disowns_ all participation in any affair. Our veracity or judgment is often the only thing implicated in the _denial:_ our guilt or innocence, honor or dishonor, is implicated in what we _disown._

####disavowed 
See [neutral](entry://neutral)

####disbelief 
**DISBELIEF, UNBELIEF.**  
_Disbelief_ properly implies the _believing_ that a thing is not, or refusing to _believe_ that it is. _Unbelief_ expresses properly a _believing_ the contrary of what one has _believed_ before: _disbelief_ is most applicable to the ordinary events of life; _unbelief_ to serious matters of opinion: our _disbelief_ of the idle tales which are told by beggars is justified by the frequent detection of their falsehood; our Saviour had compassion on Thomas for his _unbelief_, and gave him such evidences of His identity as dissipated every doubt. 

####discard 
See [dismiss](entry://dismiss)

####discern 
See [perceive](entry://perceive)

####discernment 
**DISCERNMENT, PENETRATION, DISCRIMINATION, JUDGMENT.**  
_Discernment_ expresses the power of _discerning_ (see [perceive](entry://perceive)). _Penetration_ denotes the act or power of _penetrating_, from _penetrate_, in Latin _penetratus_, participle of _penetrare_, from _penitus_, within, and _penus_, the inner part of a sanctuary, signifying to see into the interior. _Discrimination_ denotes the act or power of _discriminating_, from _discriminate_, in Latin _discriminatus_, participle of _discrimine_, to make a difference. _Judgment_ denotes the power of _judging_, from _judge_, in Latin _judico_, compounded of _jus_, right, and _dicere_, signifying to pronounce right.  
The first three of these terms do not express different powers, but different modes of the same power; namely, the power of seeing intellectually, or exerting the intellectual sight. _Discernment_ is not so powerful a mode of intellectual vision as _penetration;_ the former is a common faculty, the latter is a higher degree of the same faculty; it is the power of seeing quickly, and seeing in spite of all that intercepts the sight and keeps the object out of view: a man of common _discernment_ discerns characters which are not concealed by any particular disguise; a man of _penetration_ is not to be deceived by any artifice, however thoroughly cloaked or secured, even from suspicion. _Discernment_ and _penetration_ serve for the discovery of individual things by their outward marks; _discrimination_ is employed in the discovery of differences between two or more objects; the former consists of simple observation, the latter combines also comparison: _discernment_ and _penetration_ are great aids toward _discrimination;_ he who can _discern_ the springs of human action or _penetrate_ the views of men will be most fitted for _discriminating_ between the characters of different men.  
Although _judgment_ derives much assistance from the three former operations, it is a totally distinct power: these only discover the things that are acting on external objects by seeing them: the _judgment_ is creative; it produces by deduction from that which passes inwardly. _Discernment_ and the others are speculative; they are directed to that which is to be known, and are confined to present objects; they serve to discover truth and falsehood, perfections and defects, motives and pretexts: the _judgment_ is practical; it is directed to that which is to be done, and extends its views to the future; it marks the relations and connections of things; it foresees their consequences and effects.  
Of _discernment_, we say that it is clear; it serves to remove all obscurity and confusion: of _penetration_ we say that it is acute; it pierces every veil which falsehood draws before truth, and prevents us from being deceived: of _discrimination_ we say that it is nice; it renders our ideas accurate and serves to prevent us from confounding objects; of _judgment_ we say that it is solid or sound; it renders the conduct prudent and prevents us from committing mistakes or involving ourselves in embarrassments.  
When the question is to estimate the real qualities of either persons or things, we exercise _discernment;_ when it is required to lay open that which art or cunning has concealed, we must exercise _penetration;_ when the question is to determine the proportions and degrees of qualities in persons or things, we must use _discrimination;_ when called upon to take any step or act any part, we must employ _judgment. Discernment_ is more or less indispensable for every man in private or public stations; he who has the most promiscuous dealings with men has the greatest need of it: _penetration_ is of peculiar importance for princes and statesmen: _discrimination_ is of great utility for all who have to determine the characters and merits of others: _judgment_ is an absolute requisite for all to whom the execution or management of concerns is intrusted.

####disclaim 
**DISCLAIM, DISOWN.**  
_Disclaim_ and _disown_ are both personal acts respecting the individual who is the agent; to _disclaim_ is to throw off a _claim_, as to _disown_ (see [disavow](entry://disavow)) is not to admit as one's own; as _claim_, from the Latin _clamo_, signifies to declare with a loud tone what we want as our own; so to _disclaim_ is, with an equally loud or positive tone, to give up a _claim:_ this is a more positive act than to _disown_, which may be performed by insinuation or by the mere abstaining to own. He who feels himself disgraced by the actions that are done by his nation or his family will be ready to _disclaim_ the very name which he bears in common with the offending party; an absurd pride sometimes impels men to _disown_ their relationship to those who are beneath them in external rank and condition: an honest mind will _disclaim_ all right to praise which it feels not to belong to itself; the fear of ridicule sometimes makes a man _disown_ that which would redound to his honor.

####discord 
**DISCORD, STRIFE.**  
_Discord_ comes from Latin _dis_, apart, and the stem _cord_, heart, signifying a lack of harmony between two people, but now it is consciously used as a metaphor in which it derives its signification from the harshness produced in music by the clashing of two strings which do not suit with each other; whence, in the moral sense, the chords of the mind which come into an unsuitable collision produce a _discord. Strife_ comes from the word _strive_, to denote the action of _striving_, that is, in any angry manner (see [contend](entry://contend)); where there is _strife_ there must be _discord;_ but there may be _discord_ without _strife; discord_ consists most in the feeling; _strife_ consists most in the outward action. _Discord_ evinces itself in various ways; by looks, words, or actions: _strife_ displays itself in words or acts of violence. _Discord_ is fatal to the happiness of families; _strife_ is the greatest enemy to peace between neighbors; _discord_ arose between the goddesses on the apple being thrown into the assembly; Homer commences his poem with the _strife_ that took place between Agamemnon and Achilles. _Discord_ may arise from mere difference of opinion; _strife_ is in general occasioned by some matter of personal interest; _discord_ in the councils of a nation is the almost certain forerunner of its ruin; the common principles of politeness forbid _strife_ among persons of good breeding.

####discover 
**DISCOVER, MANIFEST, DECLARE.**  
The idea of making known is conveyed by all these terms; but _discover_, which signifies simply to take off the covering from anything, expresses less than _manifest_ (see [apparent](entry://apparent)), and that than _declare_ (see [declare](entry://declare)): we _discover_ by any means direct or indirect; we _manifest_ by unquestionable marks; we _de-dare_ by express words: talents and dispositions _discover_ themselves; particular feelings and sentiments _manifest_ themselves; facts, opinions, and sentiments are _declared;_ children early _discover_ a turn for some particular art or science; a person _manifests_ his regard for another by unequivocal proofs of kindness; a person of an open disposition is apt to _declare_ his sentiments without disguise.  
Animals or unconscious agents may be said to _discover_, as things _discover_ symptoms of decay; but persons only, or things personified, _manifest_ or _declare;_ cruelty may be _manifested_ by actions; the works of the creation _declare_ the wisdom of the Creator.

####discredit 
**DISCREDIT, DISGRACE, REPROACH, SCANDAL.**  
_Discredit_ signifies the loss of _credit; disgrace_, the loss of grace, favor, or esteem; _reproach_ stands for the thing that deserves to be _reproached._ and _scandal_ comes from _Greek σκάνδαλον_, Latin _scandalum_, a stumbling-block, from the root found in _ascend_, signifying to step or jump. The conduct of men in their various relations with one another may give rise to the unfavorable sentiment which is expressed in common by these terms. Things are said to reflect _discredit_ or _disgrace_, or to bring _reproach_ or _scandal_ on the individual. These terms seem to rise in sense one upon the other: _disgrace_ is a stronger term than _discredit, reproach_ than _disgrace_, and _scandal_ than reproach.  
_Discredit_ interferes with a man's _credit_ or respectability; _disgrace_ marks him out as an object of unfavorable distinction; _reproach_ makes him a subject of _reproachful_ conversation; _scandal_ makes him an object of offence or even abhorrence. As regularity in hours, regularity in habits or modes of living, regularity in payments, are a _credit_ to a family, so is any deviation from this order to its _discredit:_ as moral rectitude, kindness, charity, and benevolence serve to insure the good-will and esteem of men, so do instances of unfair dealing, cruelty, inhumanity, and an unfeeling temper tend to the disgrace of the offender: as a life of distinguished virtue or particular instances of moral excellence may cause a man to be spoken of in strong terms of commendation, so will flagrant atrocities or a course of immorality cause his name and himself to be the general subject of _reproach:_ as the profession of a Christian with a consistent practice is the greatest ornament which a man can put on, so is the profession with an inconsistent practice the greatest deformity that can be witnessed; it is calculated to bring a _scandal_ on religion itself in the eyes of those who do not know and feel its intrinsic excellences. _Discredit_ and _disgrace_ are negative qualities, and apply properly to the outward and adventitious circumstances of a person; but _reproach_ and _scandal_ are something positive and have respect to the moral character. A man may bring _discredit_ or _disgrace_ upon himself by trivial or indifferent things; but _reproach_ or _scandal_ follows only the violation of some positive law, moral or divine.  
The term _reproach_ is also taken for the object of reproach, and _scandal_ for the object of scandal.

####discuss 
**DISCUSS, EXAMINE.**  
_Discuss_, in Latin _discussus_, participle of _discutio_, from dis, apart, and _quatere_, to shake, signifies to shake asunder or to separate thoroughly so as to see the whole composition. _Examine_, in Latin _examina_, comes from _examen_, the middle beam, or thread, by which the poise of the balance is held, because the judgment holds the balance in examining.  
The intellectual operation expressed by these terms is applied to objects that cannot be immediately discerned or understood, but they vary both in mode and degree. _Discussion_ is altogether carried on by verbal and personal communication; _examination_ proceeds by reading, reflection, and observation; we often examine, therefore, by _discussion_, which is properly one mode of _examination;_ a _discussion_ is always carried on by two or more persons; an _examination_ may be carried on by one only: politics are a frequent though not always a pleasant subject of _discussion_ in social meetings; complicated questions cannot be too thoroughly _examined._

####disengage 
**DISENGAGE, DISENTANGLE, EXTRICATE.**  
_Disengage_ signifies to make free from an _engagement. Disentangle_ is to get rid of an _entanglement. Extricate_, in Latin _extricatus_, from _ex_ and _tricœ_, difficulties, impediments. As to _engage_ signifies simply to bind, and _entangle_ signifies to bind in an involved manner (for derivation and meaning see [embarrass](entry://embarrass)), to _disentangle_ is naturally applied to matters of greater difficulty and perplexity than to _disengage;_ and as the term _extricate_ includes the idea of that which would hold fast and keep within a tight involvement, it is employed with respect to matters of the greatest possible embarrassment and intricacy: we may be _disengaged_ from an oath; _disentangled_ from pecuniary difficulties; _extricated_ from a perplexity; it is not right to expect to be _disengaged_ from all the duties which attach to men as members of society; he who enters into metaphysical disquisitions must not expect to be soon _disentangled:_ when a general has committed himself by coming into too close a contact with a very superior force, he sometimes may be able to _extricate_ himself from his awkward situation by his generalship.

####disgust 
**DISGUST, LOATHING, NAUSEA.**  
_Disgust_, from _dis_ and _gustare_, to taste, from Latin _gustus_, the taste, denotes the aversion of the taste to an object. _Loathing_ (see [abhor](entry://abhor)). _Nausea_, in Latin _nausea_, from the Greek _ναῦς_, a ship, properly denotes seasickness.  
_Disgust_ is less than _loathing_, and that than _nausea._ When applied to sensible objects, we are _disgusted_ with dirt; we _loathe_ the smell of food if we have a sickly appetite; we _nauseate_ medicine: and when applied metaphorically we are _disgusted_ with affectation; we _loathe_ the endearments of those who are offensive; we _nauseate_ all the enjoyments of life after having made an intemperate use of them and discovered their inanity.

####dishonest 
**DISHONEST, KNAVISH.**  
_Dishonest_ marks the contrary to _honest; knavish_ marks the likeness to a _knave, from_ Anglo-Saxon _cnapa_, a boy, German _knabe_, a boy, a boy-servant; hence some one as mischievous and unreliable as boy-servants were likely to be. _Dishonest_ characterizes simply the mode of action; _knavish_ characterizes the agent as well as the action: what is _dishonest_ violates the established laws of man; what is _knavish_ supposes peculiar art and design in the accomplishment. It is _dishonest_ to take anything from another which does not belong to one's self; it is _knavish_ to get it by fraud or artifice, or by imposing on the confidence of another. We may prevent _dishonest_ practices by ordinary means of security; but we must not trust ourselves in the company of _knavish_ people if we do not wish to be overreached. 

####dishonor 
**DISHONOR, DISGRACE, SHAME.**  
_Dishonor_ signifies what does away honor. _Disgrace_ (see [degrade](entry://degrade)). _Shame_ signifies what produces _shame. Dishonor_ deprives a person of those outward marks of honor which men look for according to their rank and station, or it is the state of being _dishonored_ or less thought of and esteemed than one wishes. _Disgrace_ deprives a man of the favor and kindness which he has heretofore received from others, or it is the state of being positively cast off by those who have before favored him or by whom he ought to be looked upon with favor. It is the fault of the individual that causes the _disgrace. Shame_ expresses more than _disgrace;_ it is occasioned by direct moral turpitude or that of which one ought to be ashamed. The fear of _dishonor_ acts as a laudable stimulus to the discharge of one's duty; the fear of _disgrace_ or _shame_ serves to prevent the commission of vices or crimes. A soldier feels it a _dishonor_ not to be placed at the post of danger, but he is not always sufficiently alive to the _disgrace_ of being punished, nor is he deterred from his irregularities by the open _shame_ to which he is sometimes put in the presence of his fellow-soldiers.  
As epithets they likewise rise in sense and are distinguished by other characteristics: a _dishonorable_ action is that which violates the principles of honor; a _disgraceful_ action is that which reflects _disgrace;_ a _shameful_ action is that of which one ought to be fully _ashamed:_ it is very _dishonorable_ for a man not to keep his word; very _disgraceful_ for a gentleman to associate with those who are his inferiors in station and education; very _shameful_ for him to use his rank and influence over the lower orders only to mislead them from their duty. The sense of what is _dishonorable_ is to the superior what the sense of the _disgraceful_ is to the inferior, but the sense of what is _shameful_ is independent of rank or station, and forms a part of that moral sense which is inherent in the breast of every rational creature. Whoever, therefore, cherishes in himself a lively sense of what is _dishonorable_ or _disgraceful_ is tolerably secure of never committing anything that is _shameful._

####disjoint 
**DISJOINT, DISMEMBER.**  
_Disjoint_ signifies to separate at the joint. _Dismember_ signifies to separate the members.  
The terms here spoken of derive their distinct meaning and application from the signification of the words _joint_ and _member._ A limb of the body may be _disjointed_ if it be so put out of the _joint_ that it cannot act; but the body itself is _dismembered_ when the different limbs or parts are separated from one another.  
So in the metaphorical sense our ideas are said to be _disjointed_ when they are so thrown out of their order that they do not fall in with one another: and kingdoms are said to be _dismembered_ where any part or parts are separated from the rest. 

####dislike 
**DISLIKE, DISPLEASURE, DISSATISFACTION, DISTASTE, DISGUST.**  
_Dislike_ (see **aversion** under [averse](entry://averse)). _Displeasure_ signifies the opposite to pleasure. _Dissatisfaction_ is the opposite to satisfaction. _Distaste_ is the opposite to an agreeable taste.  
_Dislike_ and _dissatisfaction_ denote the feeling or sentiment produced either by persons or things: _displeasure_, that produced by persons only: _distaste_ and _disgust_, that produced by things only. In regard to persons, _dislike_ is the sentiment of equals and persons unconnected; _displeasure_ and _dissatisfaction_, of superiors, or such as stand in some particular relation to one another. Strangers may feel a _dislike_ upon seeing each other: parents or masters may feel _displeasure_ or _dissatisfaction:_ the former sentiment is occasioned by supposed faults in the moral conduct of the child or servant; the latter by supposed defective services. I _dislike_ a person for his assumption or loquacity; I am _displeased_ with him for his carelessness, and _dissatisfied_ with his labor. _Displeasure_ is awakened by whatever is done amiss: _dissatisfaction_ is caused by what happens amiss or contrary to our expectation. Accordingly, the word _dissatisfaction_ is not confined to persons of a particular rank, but to the nature of the connection which subsists between them. Whoever does not receive what he thinks himself entitled to from another is _dissatisfied._ A servant may be _dissatisfied_ with the treatment he meets with from his master; and may be said, therefore, to express _dissatisfaction_, though not _displeasure._  
In regard to things, _dislike_ is a casual feeling not arising from any specific cause. A _dissatisfaction_ is connected with our desires and expectations: we _dislike_ the performance of an actor from one or many causes, or from no apparent cause; but we are _dissatisfied_ with his performance if it fall short of what we were led to expect. In order to lessen the number of our _dislikes_ we ought to endeavor not to _dislike_ without a cause; and in order to lessen our _dissatisfaction_ we ought to be moderate in our expectation.  
_Dislike, distaste_, and _disgust_ rise on one another in their signification. _Distaste_ expresses more than _dislike_, and _disgust_ more than _distaste. Dislike_ is a partial feeling, quickly produced and quickly subsiding; _distaste_ is a settled feeling, gradually produced and permanent in its duration: _disgust_ is either transitory or otherwise; momentarily or gradually produced, but stronger than either of the two others. Caprice has a great share in our likes and _dislikes: distaste_ depends upon the changes to which the constitution physically and mentally is exposed: _disgust_ owes its origin to the nature of things and their natural operation on the minds of men. A child likes and _dislikes_ his playthings without any apparent cause for the change of sentiment: after a long illness a person will frequently take a _distaste_ to the food or the amusements which before afforded him much pleasure: what is indecent or filthy is a natural object of _disgust_ to every person whose mind is not depraved. It is good to suppress un- founded _dislikes;_ it is difficult to overcome a strong _distaste;_ it is advisable to divert our attention from objects calculated to create _disgust._

**DISLIKE, DISINCLINATION.** — _Dislike_ (see above). _Disinclination_ is the reverse of inclination (see [attachment](entry://attachment)). _Dislike_ applies to what one has or does; _disinclination_ only to what one does: we _dislike_ the thing we have, or _dislike_ to do a thing; but we are _disinclined_ only to do a thing. They express a similar feeling that differs in degree. _Disinclination_ is but a small degree of _dislike; dislike_ marks something contrary; _disinclination_ does not amount to more than the absence of an inclination. None but a disobliging temper has a _dislike_ to comply with reasonable requests; but the most obliging disposition may have an occasional _disinclination_ to comply with a particular request.

####dismay 
**DISMAY, DAUNT, APPAL.**  
_Dismay_ comes from the Old French participle form, _dismayé_, of a verb compounded from Latin _dis_, privative, and Old High German _magan_, might or power. _Daunt_ comes from Latin _domare_ to tame, English _tame_ being probably the same word originally. _Appal_, compounded of the intensive _ad_ and _pallere_, to grow pale, signifies to make pale with fear.  
The effect of fear on the spirit is strongly expressed by all these terms; but _dismay_ expresses less than _daunt_, and this than _appall._ We are _dismayed_ by alarming circumstances; we are _daunted_ by terrifying; we are _appalled_ by horrid circumstances. A severe defeat will _dismay_ so as to lessen the force of resistance: the fiery glare from the eyes of a ferocious beast will _daunt_ him who was venturing to approach: the sight of an apparition will _appall_ the stoutest heart. 

####dismember 
See [disjoint](entry://disjoint)

####dismiss 
**DISMISS, DISCHARGE, DISCARD.**  
_Dismiss_, in Latin _dismissus_, participle of _dimitto_, compounded of _dis_, away, and _mittere_, to send, signifies to send away. _Discharge_ signifies to release from a charge. _Discard_, in Spanish_ descartar_, compounded of _des_ and _cartar_, signifies to lay cards out or aside, to cast them off.  
The idea of removing to a distance is included in all these terms, but with various collateral circumstances. _Dismiss_ is the general term; _discharge_ and _discard_ are modes of dismissing: _dismiss_ is applicable to persons of all stations, but used more particularly for the higher orders: _discharge_, on the other hand, is confined to those in a subordinate station. A clerk is _dismissed;_ a menial servant is _discharged:_ an officer is _dismissed;_ a soldier is _discharged._  
Neither _dismiss_ nor _discharge_ defines the motive of the action; they are used indifferently for that which is voluntary or the contrary: _discard_, on the contrary, always marks a _dismissal_ that is not agreeable to the party _discarded._ A person may request to be _dismissed_ or _discharged_, but never to be _discarded._ The _dismissal_ or _discharge_ frees a person from the obligation or necessity of performing a certain duty; the _discarding_ throws him out of a desirable rank or station.  
They are all applied to things in the moral sense: we are said to _dismiss_ our fears, to _discharge_ a duty, and to _discard_ a sentiment from the mind. 

####disorder 
**DISORDER, DERANGE, DISCONCERT, DISCOMPOSE.**  
_Disorder_ signifies to put out of order. _Derange_, from _de_ and _range_ or _rank_, signifies to put out of the rank in which it was placed. _Disconcert, to_ put out of the concert or harmony. _Discompose_, to put out of a state of composure.  
All these terms express the idea of putting out of order; but the latter three vary as to the mode or object of the action. The term _disorder_ is used in a perfectly indefinite form, and might be applied to any object. As everything may be in order, so may everything be _disordered;_ yet it is seldom used except in regard to such things as have been in a natural order. _Derange_ and _disconcert_ are employed in speaking of such things as have been put into an artificial order. To _derange_ is to _disorder_ that which has been systematically arranged or put in a certain range; and to _disconcert is_ to _disorder_ that which has been put together by concert or contrivance: thus the body may be _disordered;_ a man's affairs or papers _deranged;_ a scheme _disconcerted._ To _discompose_ is a species of _derangement_ in regard to trivial matters: thus a tucker, a frill, or a cap may be _discomposed._ The slightest change of diet will _disorder_ people of tender constitutions: misfortunes are apt to _derange_ the affairs of the most prosperous: the unexpected return of a master to his home disconcerts the schemes which have been formed by the domestics: those who are particular as to their appearance are careful not to have any part of their dress _discomposed._  
When applied to the mind, _disorder_ and _derange_ are said of the intellect; _disconcert_ and _discompose_ of the ideas or spirits, the former denoting a permanent state, the latter a temporary or transient state. The mind is said to be _disordered_ when the faculty of ratiocination is in any degree interrupted; the intellect is said to be _deranged_ when it is brought into a positive state of incapacity for action: persons are sometimes _disordered_ in their minds for a time by particular occurrences who do not become actually _deranged;_ a person is said to be _disconcerted_ who suddenly loses his collectedness of thinking: he is said to be _discomposed_ who loses his regularity of feeling. A sense of shame is the most apt to _disconcert:_ the more irritable the temper the more easily one is _discomposed._

**DISORDER, DISEASE, DISTEMPER, MALADY.** — _Disorder_ signifies the state of being out of order. _Disease_ signifies the state of being ill at ease, from Old French _des_, privative, and _aise_, ease. _Distemper_ signifies the state of being out of temper or out of a due temperament. _Malady_ is derived from the Latin _male habitus_, badly settled, in a bad condition.  
All these terms agree in their application to the state of the animal body. _Disorder_ is, as before, the general term, and the other specific. In this general sense _disorder_ is altogether indefinite; but in its restricted sense it expresses less than all the rest: it is the mere commencement of a _disease: disease_ is also more general than the other terms, for it comprehends every serious and permanent _disorder_ in the animal economy, and is therefore of universal application. The _disorder_ is slight, partial, and transitory: the _disease_ is deep-rooted and permanent. The _disorder_ may he in the extremities: the _disease_ lies in the humors and the vital parts. Occasional headaches, colds, and what is merely cutaneous are termed _disorders;_ fevers, dropsies, and the like are _diseases. Distemper_ is used for such particularly as throw the animal frame most completely out of its temper or course, and is consequently applied properly to virulent _disorders_, such as the smallpox. _Malady_ has less of a technical sense than the other terms; it refers more to the suffering than to the state of the body. There may be many _maladies_ where there is no _disease;_ but _diseases_ are themselves in general _maladies._ Our _maladies_ are frequently born with us, but our _diseases_ may come upon us at any time of life. Blindness is in itself a _malady_ and may be produced by a _disease_ in the eye. Our _disorders_ are frequently cured by abstaining from those things which caused them; the whole science of medicine consists in finding out suitable remedies for our _diseases;_ our _maladies_ may be lessened with patience, although they cannot always be alleviated or removed by art.  
The terms _disorder, disease_, and _distemper_ may be applied with a similar distinction to the mind as well as the body. The _disorders_ are either of a temporary or a permanent nature, but, unless specified to the contrary, are understood to be temporary: _diseases_ consist in vicious habits: our _distempers_ arise from the violent operations of passion; our _maladies_ he in the injuries which the affections occasion. Any perturbation in the mind is a _disorder:_ avarice is a _disease:_ melancholy is a _distemper_ as far as it throws the mind out of its bias; it is a _malady_ as far as it occasions suffering. )

####disparage 
**DISPARAGE, DETRACT, TRADUCE, DEPRECIATE, DEGRADE, DECRY.**  
_Disparage_, compounded of _dis_ and Late Latin _paraticum_, from _par_, equal, signifies to make a thing unequal or below what it ought to be. _Detract_ (see [asperse](entry://asperse)). _Traduce_, from Latin _trans_, across, and _ducere_, to lead, signifies to carry from one to another that which is unfavorable. _Depreciate_, from the Latin _pretium_, a price, signifies to bring down the price. _Degrade_ (see [abase](entry://abase)). _Decry_ signifies literally to cry down.  
The idea of lowering the value of an object is common to all these words, which differ in the circumstances and object of the action. _Disparagement_ is the most indefinite in the manner: _detract_ and _traduce_ are specific in the forms by which an object is lowered: _disparagement_ respects the mental endowments and qualifications: _detract_ and _traduce_ are said of the moral character, the former, however, in a less specific manner than the latter. We _disparage_ a man's performance by speaking slightingly of it: we _detract_ from the merits of a person by ascribing his success to chance; we _traduce_ him by handing about tales that are unfavorable to his reputation: thus authors are apt to _disparage_ the writings of their rivals; or a soldier may _detract_ from the skill of his commander, or he may _traduce_ him by relating scandalous reports.  
To _disparage, detract_, and _traduce_ can be applied only to persons or that which is personal; _depreciate, degrade_, and _decry_, to whatever is an object of esteem; we _depreciate_ and _degrade_, therefore, things as well as persons, and _decry_ things: to. _depreciate_ is, however, not so strong a term as to _degrade_, for the language which is employed to _depreciate_ will be mild compared with that used for _degrading:_ we may _depreciate_ an object by implication or in indirect terms, but harsh and unseemly epithets are employed for _degrading:_ thus a man may be said to _depreciate_ human nature who does not represent it as capable of its true elevation; he _degrades_ it who sinks it below the scale of rationality. We may _depreciate_ or _degrade_ an individual, a language, and the like; we _decry_ measures and principles: the former two are an act of an individual; the latter is properly the act of many. Some men have such perverted notions that they are always _depreciating_ whatever is esteemed excellent in the world: they whose interests have stifled all feelings of humanity have _degraded_ the poor Africans in order to justify the enslaving of them: political partisans commonly _decry_ the measures of one party in order to exalt those of another.  
**DISPARAGE, DEROGATE, DEGRADE.** — _Disparage_ (see above). _Derogate_, in Latin _derogatus_, from _de_, from, away, and _rogare_, to ask, meaning to "ask away, " to repeal in part, signifies to take from a thing that which is claimed. _Degrade_ (see [abase](entry://abase)).  
_Disparage_ is here employed, not as the act of persons, but of things, in which case it is allied to _derogate_, but retains its indefinite and general sense as before: circumstances may _disparage_ the performances of a writer, or they may _derogate_ from the honors and dignities of an individual: it would be a high _disparagement_ to an author to have it known that he had been guilty of plagiarism; it _derogates_ from the dignity of a magistrate to take part in popular measures. To _degrade_ is here, as in the former case, a much stronger expression than the other two: whatever _disparages_ or _derogates_ does but take away a part from the value: but whatever _degrades_ a thing sinks it many degrees in the estimation of those in whose eyes it is _degraded;_ in this manner religion is _degraded_ by the low arts of its enthusiastic professors: whatever tends to the _disparagement_ of learning or knowledge does injury to the cause of truth; whatever _derogates_ from the dignity of a man in any office is apt to _degrade_ the office itself. 

####disparity 
**DISPARITY, INEQUALITY.**  
_Disparity_, from _dis_, negative, and _par_ equal, means to be unequal. _Inequality_, from the Latin _in_, negative, and _œquus_, even, signifies having no regularity.  
_Disparity_ applies to two objects which should meet or stand in coalition with each other: _inequality_ is applicable to those who are compared with each other: the _disparity_ of age, situation, and circumstances is to be considered with regard to persons entering into a matrimonial connection; the _inequality_ in the portion of labor. which is to be performed by two persons is a ground for the _inequality_ of their recompense: there is a great _inequality_ in the chance of success where there is a _disparity_ of acquirements in rival candidates: the _disparity_ between David and Goliath was such as to render the success of the former more strikingly miraculous; the _inequality_ in the conditions of men is not attended with a corresponding _inequality_ in their happiness. 

####dispassionate 
**DISPASSIONATE, COOL.**  
_Dispassionate_ is taken negatively, it marks merely the absence of passion; _cool_ is taken positively, it marks an entire freedom from passion.  
Those who are prone to be passionate must learn to be _dispassionate;_ those who are of a _cool_ temperament will not suffer their passions to be roused. _Dispassionate_ solely respects angry or irritable sentiments; _cool_ respects any perturbed feeling: when we meet with an angry disputant it is necessary to be _dispassionate_ in order to avoid quarrels; in the moment of danger our safety often depends upon our _coolness._

####dispel 
**DISPEL, DISPERSE.**  
_Dispel_, from the Latin _pellere_, to drive, signifies to drive away. _Disperse_ comes from Latin _dis_, apart, and _spargere_, to scatter, and means to scatter in all directions.  
_Dispel_ is a more forcible action than to _disperse:_ we destroy the existence of a thing by _dispelling_ it; we merely destroy the junction or cohesion of a body by _dispersing_ it; the sun _dispels_ the clouds and darkness; the wind _disperses_ the clouds or a surgeon _disperses_ a tumor. 

####dispense 
**DISPENSE, DISTRIBUTE.**  
_Dispense_, from _dis_, asunder, and _pendere_, to weigh, to weigh out money, to bestow, signifies to bestow in different directions; and _distribute_, from the Latin _tribuere_, to assign, signifies the same thing. _Dispense_ is an indiscriminate action; _distribute_ is a particularizing action: we _dispense_ to all; we _distribute_ to each individually: nature _dispenses_ her gifts bountifully to all the inhabitants of the earth; a parent _distributes_ among his children different tokens of his parental tenderness. _Dispense_ is an indirect action that has no immediate reference to the receiver; d_istribute_ is a direct and personal action communicated by the giver to the receiver: Providence _dispenses_ His favors to those who put a sincere trust in Him; a prince _distributes_ marks of his favor and preference among his courtiers.

####displease 
**DISPLEASE, OFFEND, VEX.**  
_Displease_ (see [dislike](entry://dislike)) naturally marks the contrary of pleasing. _Offend_, from Latin _ob_, against, and _fendere_, to strike, means, literally, to strike against. _Vex_, in Latin _vexo_, is a frequentative of _vehere_, to carry (whence _vehicle)_, signifying literally to toss up and down.  
These words express the painful sentiment which is felt by the supposed impropriety of another's conduct. _Displease_ is not always applied to that which personally concerns ourselves; although _offend_ and _vex_ have always more or less of what is personal in them: a superior may be _displeased_ with one who is under his charge for improper behavior toward persons in general; he will be _offended_ with him for disrespectful behavior toward himself or neglect of his interests: circumstances as well as actions serve to _displease;_ a supposed intention or design is requisite in order to _offend;_ we may be _displeased_ with a person or at a thing; one is mostly _offended_ with the person; a child may be _displeased_ at not having any particular liberty or indulgence granted to him; he may be _offended_ with his playfellow for an act of incivility or unkindness.  
_Displease_ respects mostly the inward state of feeling; _offend_, and _vex_ have most regard to the outward cause which provokes the feeling: a humorsome person may be _displeased_ without any apparent cause, but a captious person will at least have some avowed trifle for which he is _offended. Vex_ expresses more than _offend;_ it marks, in fact, frequent efforts to _offend_, or the act of _offending_ under aggravated circumstances: we often unintentionally _displease_ or _offend_, but he who _vexes_ has mostly that object in view in so doing: any instance of neglect _displeases;_ any marked instance of neglect _offends;_ any aggravated instance of neglect _vexes._ The feeling of _displeasure_ is more perceptible and vivid than that of _offence_, but it is less durable: the feeling of _vexation_ is as transitory as that of _displeasure_, but stronger than either. _Displeasure_ and _vexation_ betray themselves by an angry word or look; _offence_ discovers itself in the whole conduct: our _displeasure_ is unjustifiable when it exceeds the measure of another's fault; it is a mark of great weakness to take _offence_ at trifles; persons of the greatest irritability are exposed to the most frequent _vexations._  
These terms may all be applied to the acts of unconscious agents on the mind.  
As epithets they admit of a similar distinction: it is very _displeasing_ to parents not to meet with the most respectful attentions from children when they give them counsel; and such conduct on the part of children is highly _offensive_ to God: when we meet with an _offensive_ object we do most wisely to turn away from it: when we are troubled with _vexatious_ affairs our best and only remedy is patience.  
**DISPLEASURE, ANGER, DISAPPROBATION.** — _Displeasure_ (see [dislike](entry://dislike)). _Anger_ (for derivation see [anger](entry://anger)). _Disapprobation_ is the reverse of _approbation_ (see [assent](entry://assent)).  
Between _displeasure_ and _anger_ there is a difference in the degree, the cause, and the consequence of the feeling: _displeasure_ is always a softened and gentle feeling; _anger_ is always a harsh feeling, and sometimes rises to vehemence and madness. _Displeasure_ is always produced by some adequate cause, real or supposed; but _anger_ may be provoked by every or any cause, according to the temper of the individual: _displeasure_ is mostly satisfied with a simple, verbal expression; but _anger_, unless kept down with great force, always seeks to return evil for evil. _Displeasure_ and _disapprobation_ are to be compared, inasmuch as they respect the conduct of those who are under the direction of others: _displeasure_ is an act of the will, it is an angry sentiment; _disapprobation_ is an act of the judgment, it is an opposite opinion: any mark of self-will in a child is calculated to excite _displeasure;_ a mistaken choice in matrimony may produce _disapprobation_ in the parent.  
_Displeasure_ is always produced by that which is already come to pass; _disapprobation_ may be felt upon that which is to take place; a master feels _displeasure_ at the carelessness of his servant; a parent expresses his _disapprobation_ of his son's proposal to leave his situation; it is sometimes prudent to check our _displeasure_, and mostly prudent to express our _disapprobation;_ the former cannot be expressed without inflicting pain; the latter cannot be withheld when required without the danger of misleading.

####disposal 
**DISPOSAL, DISPOSITION.**  
These words derive their different meanings from the verb to _dispose_, to which they owe their common origin. _Disposal_ is a personal act; it depends upon the will of the individual: _disposition_ is an act of the judgment; it depends upon the nature of the things. The removal of a thing from one's self is involved in a _disposal;_ the good order of the things is comprehended in their _disposition._ The _disposal_ of property is in the hands of the rightful owner; the success of a battle often depends upon the right _disposition_ of an army.  
**DISPOSE, ARRANGE, DIGEST.** — _Dispose_, in French _disposer_, from Latin _dis_, apart, and French _poser_, is derived from Greek _πανσις_, a pause, not from Latin _ponere_ (see [compose](entry://compose)). _Arrange_ (see [class](entry://class)). _Digest_, in Latin _digestus_, participle of _digero_, or _dis_, apart, and _gerere_, past participle _gestus_, to carry, signifies to gather apart with design.  
The idea of a systematic laying apart is common to all, and proper to the word _dispose._ We _dispose_ when we _arrange_ and _digest;_ but we do not always _arrange_ and _digest_ when we _dispose;_ they differ in the circumstances and object of the action. There is less thought employed in _disposing_ than in _arranging_ and _digesting;_ we may _dispose_ ordinary matters by simply assigning a place to each; in this manner trees are _disposed_ in a row, but we _arrange_ and _digest_ by an intellectual effort; in the first case by putting those together which ought to go together, and in the latter case by both separating that which is dissimilar and bringing together that which is similar; in this manner books are _arranged_ in a library according to their size or their subject; the materials for a literary production are _digested_, or the laws of the land are _digested._ What is not wanted should be neatly _disposed_ in a suitable place: nothing contributes so much to beauty and convenience as the _arrangement_ of everything according to the way and manner in which they should follow; when writings are involved in great intricacy and confusion, it is difficult to _digest_ them.  
In an extended and moral application of these words we speak of a person's time, talent, and the like being _disposed_ to a good purpose; of a man's ideas being properly _arranged_, and of being _digested_ into form. On the _disposition_ of a man's time and property will depend in a great measure his success in life; on the _arrangement_ of accounts greatly depends his facility in conducting business; on the habit of _digesting_ our thoughts depends in a great measure correctness of thinking.

**DISPOSITION, TEMPER.** — _Disposition_, from _dispose_, signifies here the state of being _disposed. Temper_, like _temperament_, from the Latin _temperare_, to temper or manage, signifies the thing modelled or formed.  
These terms are both applied to the mind and its bias; but _disposition_ respects the whole frame and texture of the mind; _temper_ respects only the bias or tone of the feelings.  
_Disposition_ is permanent and settled; _temper_ may be transitory and fluctuating. The _disposition_ comprehends the springs and motives of actions; the _temper_ influences the action of the moment: it is possible and not infrequent to have a good _disposition_ with a bad _temper_, and _vice versa._  
A good _disposition_ makes a man a useful member of society, but not always a good companion; a good _temper_ renders him acceptable to all and peaceable with all, but essentially useful to none: a good _disposition_ will go far toward correcting the errors of _temper;_ but where there is a bad _disposition_ there are no hopes of amendment. The _disposition_ is properly said to be natural, the _temper_ is rather acquired or formed by circumstances.  
If the _temper_ be taken for what is natural, it implies either the physical temperament or that frame of mind which results from or is influenced by it.  
**DISPOSITION, INCLINATION.** — _Disposition_ in the former section is taken for the general frame of the mind; in the present case for its particular frame. _Inclination_ (see [attachment](entry://attachment)).  
_Disposition_ is more positive than _inclination._ We may always expect a man to do that which he is _disposed_ to do; but we cannot always calculate upon his executing that to which he is merely _inclined._ We indulge a _disposition;_ we yield to an _inclination._ The _disposition_ comprehends the whole state of the mind at the time; an _inclination_ is particular, referring always to a particular object. After the performance of a serious duty, no one is expected to be in a _disposition_ for laughter or merriment: it is becoming to suppress our _inclination_ to laughter in the presence of those who wish to be serious; we should be careful not to enter into controversy with one who shows a _disposition_ to be unfriendly. When a young person discovers any _inclination_ to study, there are hopes of his improvement.

####disregard 
**DISREGARD, NEGLECT, SLIGHT.**  
_Disregard_ signifies properly not to _regard. Neglect_, in Latin _neglectus_, participle of _negligo_, is compounded of _nec_, not, and _legare_, to gather or choose out, signifying not to choose, to pay no attention to. _Slight_ comes from an Old Low German word which originally meant flat, smooth, and developed in English through a series of meanings, smooth, simple, etc., into the meaning of trivial, unimportant. The verb _slight_ means to treat as if of no importance.  
We _disregard_ the warnings, the words, or opinions of others; we _neglect_ their injunctions or their precepts. To _disregard_ results from the settled purpose of the mind; to _neglect_, from a temporary forgetfulness or oversight. What is _disregarded_ is seen and passed over; what is _neglected_ is generally not thought of at the time required. What is _disregarded_ does not strike the mind at all; what is _neglected_ enters the mind only when it is before the eye: what we _disregard_ is not esteemed; what we _neglect_ is often esteemed, but not sufficiently to be remembered or practised: a child _disregards_ the prudent counsels of a parent; he _neglects_ to use the remedies which have been prescribed to him.  
_Disregard_ and _neglect_ are frequently not personal acts; they respect the thing more than the person; _slight_ is altogether an intentional act toward an individual or toward any object which one has heretofore esteemed or ought to esteem.

####dissension 
**DISSENSION, CONTENTION, DISCORD.**  
_Dissension_ marks either the act or the state of _dissenting. Contention_ marks the act of _contending. Discord_ (see [contention](entry://contention)).  
A collision of opinions produces _dissension;_ a collision of interests produces _contention;_ a collision of humors produces _discord._ A love of one's own opinion, combined with a disregard for the opinion of others, gives rise to _dissension;_ selfishness is the main cause of _contention_, and an ungoverned temper that of _discord. Dissension_ is peculiar to bodies or communities of men; _contention_ is applicable mostly, and _discord_ always, to individuals. A Christian temper of conformity to the general will of those with whom one is in connection would do away with _dissension;_ a limitation of one's desire to that which is attainable by legitimate means would put a stop to _contention;_ a correction of one's impatient and irritable humor would check the progress of _discord. Dissension_ tends not only to alienate the minds of men from one another, but to dissolve the bonds of society; _contention_ is accompanied by anger, ill-will, envy, and many evil passions; _discord_ interrupts the progress of the kind affections, and bars all tender intercourse.

####distant 
**DISTANT, FAR, REMOTE.**  
_Distant_ is employed as an adjunct or otherwise; _far_ is used only as an adverb. We speak of _distant_ objects, or objects being _distant;_ but we speak of things only as being _far. Distant_, in Latin _distans_, compounded of _dis_, apart, and the participle _stans_, standing, from the verb _stare_, to stand, means standing apart, and is employed only for bodies at rest. _Far_ comes from a Germanic and ultimately an Aryan root meaning beyond, found in Greek _πέραν_, beyond; and is employed for bodies either stationary or otherwise; hence we say a thing is _distant_, or it goes, runs, or flies _far. Distant_ is used to designate great space; _far_ only that which is ordinary: astronomers estimate that the sun is ninety-four millions of miles _distant_ from the earth; a person lives not very _far_ off, or a person is _far_ from the spot. _Distant_ is used absolutely to express an intervening space. _Remote_, in Latin _remotus_, participle of _removere_, to move back or away, rather expresses the relative idea of being gone out of sight. A person is said to live in a _distant_ country, or in a _remote_ corner of any country.  
They bear a similar analogy in the figurative application; when we speak of a _remote_ idea it designates that which is less liable to strike the mind than a _distant_ idea. A _distant_ relationship between individuals is never altogether lost sight of; when the connection between objects is very _remote_ it easily escapes observation.

####distinguish 
**DISTINGUISH, DISCRIMINATE.**  
To _distinguish_ (see [abstract](entry://abstract)) is the general, to _discriminate_ (see [discernment](entry://discernment)) is the particular term: the former is an indefinite, the latter a definite action. To _discriminate_ is in fact to _distinguish_ specifically; hence we speak of a _distinction_ as true or false, but of a _discrimination_ as nice. We _distinguish_ things as to their divisibility or unity; we _discriminate_ them as to their inherent properties; we _distinguish_ things that are alike or unlike, in order to separate or collect them; we _discriminate_ those that are different, for the purpose of separating one from the other: we _distinguish_ by means of the senses as well as the understanding; we _discriminate_ by the understanding only: we _distinguish_ things by their color or we _distinguish_ moral objects by their truth or falsehood; we _discriminate_ the characters of men or we _discriminate_ their merits according to circumstances.  
See also [abstract](entry://abstract); [perceive](entry://perceive); **signalize** under [sign](entry://sign)  
**DISTINGUISH, CONSPICUOUS, NOTED, EMINENT, ILLUSTRIOUS.** — _Distinguished_ signifies having a mark of _distinction_ by which a tiling is to be _distinguished_ (see [abstract](entry://abstract)). _Conspicuous_, in Latin _conspicuus_, from _con_, intensive, and _spicere_, to see, signifies easily to be seen. _Noted_ comes from _notus_, known, well known. _Eminent_, in Latin _eminens_, from _emineo_, or _e_ and a stem _min_, signifying to project, found in English _prominent_, means projecting out. _Illustrious_ is a badly coined word from the root of _lux_, light, meaning full of light, shining out.  
The idea of an object having something attached to it to excite notice is common to all these terms. _Distinguished_ in its general sense expresses little more than this idea; the rest are but modes of the _distinguished._ A thing is _distinguished_ in proportion as it is distinct or separate from others; it is _conspicuous_ in proportion as it is easily seen; it is _noted_ in proportion as it is widely known. In this sense a rank is _distinguished;_ a situation is _conspicuous;_ a place is _noted._ Persons are _distinguished_ by external marks or by characteristic qualities; persons or things are _conspicuous_ mostly from some external mark; persons or things are _noted_ mostly by collateral circumstances. A man may be _distinguished_ by his decorations, or he may be _distinguished_ by his manly air, or by his abilities: a person is _conspicuous_ by the gaudiness of his dress; a house is _conspicuous_ that stands on a hill: a person is _noted_ for having performed a wonderful cure; a place is _noted_ for its fine waters.  
We may be _distinguished_ for things good, bad, or indifferent: we may be _conspicuous_ for our singularities or that which only attracts vulgar notice: we may be _noted_ for that which is bad, and mostly for that which is the subject of vulgar discourse: we can be _eminent_ and _illustrious_ only for that which is really good and praiseworthy; the former applies, however, mostly to those things which set a man high in the circle of his acquaintance; the latter to that which makes him shine before the world. A man of _distinguished_ talent will be apt to excite envy if he be not also _distinguished_ for his private virtue: affection is never better pleased than when it can place itself in such a _conspicuous_ situation as to draw all eyes upon itself: lovers of fame are sometimes contented to render themselves _noted_ for their vices or absurdities: nothing is more gratifying to a man than to render himself _eminent_ for his professional skill: it is the lot of but few to be _illustrious_, and those few are very seldom to be envied.  
In an extended and moral application these terms may be employed as epithets to heighten the character of an object: valor may be said to be _distinguished_, piety _eminent_, and a name _illustrious._

####distress 
**DISTRESS, ANXIETY, ANGUISH, AGONY.**  
_Distress_ (see **adversity** under [adverse](entry://adverse)). _Anxiety_ is allied to Latin _angustus_, narrow, and _angere_, to choke, from a root found also in _anger. Agony_, in French _agonie_, Latin _agonia_, Greek _άγωνία_, a struggle, signifies a severe struggle with pain and suffering.  
_Distress_ is the pain felt when in a strait from which we see no means of extricating ourselves; _anxiety_ is that pain which one feels on the prospect of an evil. _Distress_ always depends upon some outward cause; _anxiety_ often lies in the imagination. _Distress is_ produced by the present but not always immediate evil; _anxiety_ respects that which is future; _anguish_ arises from the reflection on the evil that is past; _agony_ springs from witnessing that which is immediate or before the eye.  
_Distress is_ not peculiar to any age; where there is a consciousness of good and evil, pain and pleasure, _distress_ will inevitably exist from some circumstance or another. _Anxiety, anguish_, and _agony_ belong to riper years: infancy and childhood are deemed the happy periods of human existence because they are exempt from the _anxieties_ attendant on every one who has a station to fill and duties to discharge. _Anguish_ and _agony_ are species of distress, of the severer kind, which spring altogether from the maturity of reflection and the full consciousness of evil. A child is in _distress_ when it loses its mother, and the mother is also in _distress_ when she misses her child. The station of a parent is, indeed, that which is most productive, not only of _distress_, but of _anxiety, anguish_, and _agony:_ the mother has her peculiar _anxieties_ for her child while rearing it in its infant state: the father has his _anxiety_ for its welfare on its entrance into the world: they both suffer the deepest _anguish_ when their child disappoints their dearest hopes by running a career of vice; not unfrequently they are doomed to suffer the _agony_ of seeing a child encircled in flames from which he cannot be snatched, or sinking into a watery grave from which he cannot be rescued.  
See also [afflict](entry://afflict)  
**DISTRESS, HARASS, PERPLEX.** — _Distress_ (see above). _Harass_, in French _harasser_, is possibly derived from Old French _harer_, to set a dog on, from an Old High German word to call out. _Perplex_, in Latin _perplexus_, participle of _perplector_, compounded of _plectere_, to plait, with the prefix _per_, through, meaning to braid in and out, hence to make something difficult to unravel or to understand.  
A person is _distressed_ either in his outward circumstances or his feelings; he is _harassed_, mentally or corporeally; he is _perplexed_ in his understanding more than in his feelings: a deprivation _distresses;_ provocations and hostile measures _harass;_ stratagems and ambiguous measures _perplex:_ a besieged town is _distressed_ by the cutting off its resources of water and provisions; the besieged are _harassed_ by perpetual attacks; the besiegers are _perplexed_ in all their manœuvres and plans by the counter-manoeuvres and contrivances of their opponents: a tale of woe _distresses;_ continual alarms and incessant labor _harass;_ unexpected obstacles and inextricable difficulties _perplex._

####distribute 
**DISTRIBUTE, ALLOT, ASSIGN, APPORTION.**  
_Distribute_, in Latin _distributus_, participle of _distribuo_, from _dis_, apart, and _tribuere_, to bestow, signifies to portion out to several. _Allot_ (for derivation see [allot](entry://allot)). _Assign_, in French _assigner_, Latin _assigno_, from _ad_, to, and _signare_, to set a seal to, signifies, by signing or marking, to set out for a particular purpose. _Apportion_, from _ad_, to, and _portio_, a part prepared, signifies to give by way of portion for a particular purpose.  
The idea of giving to several is common to these terms; this is the proper signification of _distribute;_ but to that of the other terms is annexed some qualification. _Distributing_ is always applied to a number of individuals, but _allotting, assigning_, or _apportioning_ is the giving either to one or several: a sum of money is _distributed_ among a number of poor people; it is _allotted, assigned_, or _apportioned_ to a particular individual, or to each individual out of a number. _Distribute is_ said properly of that which is divided, or divisible into any number of parts, as bread is _distributed_ in loaves, or money is _distributed_ in the way of shillings; _allotted_, is applied to that which is divisible into lots, and _apportion_ to that which is formed into certain proportional parts or portions, as to _allot_ land, to give a lot of land; to _apportion_ a sum of money — that is, to give it in certain proportions. _Assign is_ applied to any distinct whole, not considered either as divided or divisible, as to _assign_ a house, place, etc. To _distribute_ is to give promiscuously, without reference to the nature of objects or the purpose for which they are given; things may be _distributed_ to the worthy or the unworthy, to those who want it or those who do not, at the will of the _distributor_ or otherwise. To _allot_ is to give according to the lots into which the thing is divided for a given purpose, as to _allot_ land to each cottager; to _assign_ is to set apart something that is suited to the person or adapted for the object proposed, as a prize is _assigned_ to the most meritorious; a house is _assigned_ for the reception of the houseless wanderer; to _apportion_ is to give in a certain proportion according to a certain rule, as to _apportion_ rent to different houses according to their size and value.  
So in the figurative or moral application, the goods or ills of life are _distributed_ by a wise Providence, but often in ways or for purposes that are hidden from our view.  
Particular portions of that which is desirable, or the contrary, is _allotted_ to each according to the circumstances of the case.  
Offices, duties, properties, and the like are _assigned_ according as they really are or are supposed to be suitable.  
Labor, happiness, misery, or anything of which only parts can be had, may be _apportioned._

####district 
**DISTRICT, REGION, TRACT, QUARTER.**  
_District_ is derived from the past participle of the verb _distringere_, from _dis_, apart, and _stringere_, to pull. It means to pull asunder, to vex, hence to force or rule; a _district_ was a section in which a lord has power to enforce justice. _Region_, in Latin _regio_, from _regere_, to rule, signifies a portion that is within rule. _Tract_, in Latin _tractus_, from _trahere_, to draw, signifies a part drawn out. _Quarter_, from Latin _quartus_, signifies literally a fourth part. These terms are all applied to portions of country, the former two comprehending divisions marked out on political grounds; the latter a geographical or an indefinite division: _district_ is smaller than a _region;_ the former refers only to part of a country, the latter frequently applies to a whole country: a _quarter_ is indefinite, and may be applied either to a _quarter_ of the world or a particular neighborhood: a _tract_ is the smallest portion of all, and comprehends frequently no more than what may fall within the compass of the eye. We consider a _district_ only with relation to government; every magistrate acts within a certain _district:_ we speak of a _region_ when considering the circumstances of climate, or the natural properties which distinguish different parts of the earth; as the _regions_ of heat and cold: we speak of the _quarter_ simply to designate a point of the compass; as a person lives in a certain _quarter_ of the town that is north or south, east or west, etc.; and so also, in an extended application, we say to meet with opposition in an unexpected _quarter:_ we speak of a _tract_ to designate the land that runs on in a line; as a mountainous _tract._

####distrust 
**DISTRUST, SUSPICION, DIFFIDENCE.**  
_Distrust_ signifies not putting trust in (see [belief](entry://belief)). _Suspicion_, from the Latin _suspicio_, or _sub_ and _specere_, signifies looking at askance, or with a _wry_ mind. _Diffidence_, from the Latin _diffido_ or _disfido_, signifies having no faith.  
_Distrust_ is said of either ourselves or others; _suspicion_ is said only of others; _diffidence_ only of ourselves: to be _distrustful_ of a person is to impute no good to him; to be _suspicious_ of a person is to impute positive evil to him: he who is _distrustful_ of another's honor or prudence will abstain from giving him his confidence; he who is _suspicious_ of another's honesty will be cautious to have no dealings with him.  
_Distrust_ is a particular state of feeling having a specific object; _suspicion_ is an habitual state of feeling, and has indefinite objects.  
As regards one's self, a person may _distrust_ his own powers for the execution of a particular office, or a _distrust_ of himself in company; he has a general _diffidence_, or he is naturally _diffident._

####disturb 
**DISTURB, INTERRUPT.**  
_Disturb_ (see [commotion](entry://commotion)). _Interrupt_, from the Latin _inter_, between, and _rumpere_, to break, signifies to break in between so as to stop the progress.  
We may be _disturbed_ either inwardly or outwardly; we are _interrupted_ only outwardly: our minds may be _disturbed_ by disquieting reflections, or we may be _disturbed_ in our rest or in our ι business by unseemly noises; but we can be _interrupted_ only in our business or pursuits: the _disturbance_, therefore, depends upon the character of the person; what _disturbs_ one man will not _disturb_ another: an _interruption_ is, however, something positive: what _interrupts_ one person will _interrupt_ another: the smallest noises may _disturb_ one who is in bad health; illness or the visits of friends will _interrupt_ a person in any of his business.  
The same distinction exists between these words when applied to things as to persons: whatever is put out of its order or proper condition is _disturbed;_ thus water which is put into motion from a state of rest is _disturbed:_ whatever is stopped in the evenness or regularity of its course is _interrupted;_ thus water which is turned out of its ordinary channel is _interrupted._

####divide 
**DIVIDE, SEPARATE, PART.**  
_Divide_ comes from Latin _dis_, apart, and a lost verb meaning to separate. _Separate_ (see [abstract](entry://abstract)). _Part_ signifies to make into _parts._  
That is said to be _divided_ which has been or is conceived to be a whole, that is _separated_ which might be joined: an army may be _divided_ into two or three divisions or portions: the _divisions_ are frequently _separated_ in their march. Things may be _divided_ by anything which distinguishes the parts from one another; they are _separated_ by disjunction of space only.  
Things may be mentally divided, but they are separated only corporeally: the minds of men are often most _divided_ when in person they are least _separated._  
To _part_ has an intermediate sense between _divide_ and _separate;_ to _divide_ is properly to make any whole into two _parts;_ to _part_ is to destroy the cohesion of two or more wholes when joined together: a loaf is _divided_ when it is cut into two or more pieces; two loaves are _parted._ Sometimes things are both _divided_ and _parted_ in order to be distributed; in this case the distinction is the same; solid things, or what is in à mass, is _divided;_ but things which do not lose their integrity are _parted:_ an estate is _divided;_ goods or effects are _parted._  
As disjunction is the common idea attached to both _separate_ and _part_, they are frequently used in relation to the same objects; things are mostly said to be _parted_ which are made to be apart for any temporary purpose or by any means, however slight or trivial; thus rooms may be _parted_ by a partition; that is said to be _separated_ which is intended to be kept permanently separate, or which ought not to be joined; thus fields are _separated_ by hedges.  
With regard to persons, _part_ designates the actual leaving of the person; _separate_ is used in general for that which lessens the society; the former is often casual, temporary, or partial; the latter is positive and serious; the _parting_ is momentary; the _separation_ may be longer or shorter: two friends _part_ in the streets after a casual meeting; two persons _separate_ on the road who had set out to travel together; men and their wives often _part_ without coming to a positive _separation:_ some couples are _separated_ from each other in every respect but that of being directly _parted;_ the moment of _parting_ between friends is often more painful than the _separation_ which afterward ensues.  
**DIVIDE, DISTRIBUTE, SHARE.** — _Divide_ (see above). _Distribute_, in Latin _distributus_, from _distribuere_, or _dis_ and _tribuere_, signifies to bestow apart. _Share_, allied to the word _shear_, and the German _scheeren_, signified originally to cut.  
The act of _dividing_ does not extend beyond the thing _divided;_ that of _distributing_ and _sharing_ comprehends also the purpose of the action: we _divide_ the thing; we _distribute_ to the person: we may _divide_, therefore, without _distributing;_ or we may _divide_ in order to _distribute:_ thus we _divide_ our land into distinct fields for our private convenience; or we _divide_ a sum of money into so many parts, in order to _distribute_ it among a given number of persons: on the other hand, we may _distribute_ without _dividing;_ for money, books, fruit, and many other things may be _distributed_ which require no _division._  
To _share_ is to make into parts, the same as _divide_, and it is to give those parts to some persons, the same as _distribute;_ but the person who _shares_ takes a part himself; he who _distributes_ gives it all to others; a loaf is _divided_ in order to be eaten, bread is _distributed_ in loaves among the poor; the loaf is _shared_ by a poor man with his poorer neighbor, or the profits of a business are _shared_ by the partners.  
To _share_ may imply either to give or to receive; to _distribute_ implies giving only: we _share_ our own with another, or another _shares_ what we have; but we _distribute_ our own to others.

####divorce 
**DIVORCE, SEPARATION.**  
_Divorce_, in French the same form, from the Latin _divortium_, compounded of dis, apart, and _vertere_, to turn, means the legal dissolution of the marriage contract, with a complete severance of all mutual claims and the right to remarry. A _separation_, often called a _legal separation_ or a _judicial separation_, is a separation countenanced or required by a court of law, but not implying a complete severance of the marriage tie or the right to remarry. _Divorce_ is often used, in a figurative sense, to refer to any disunion of things which have been closely united, and _separation_, of course, has also a wider application.

####docile 
**DOCILE, TRACTABLE, DUCTILE.**  
_Docile_, in Latin _docilis_, from _docere_, to teach, means ready to be taught. _Tractable_, from _tractare_, the frequentative of _trahere_, to draw, denotes the readiness to be drawn. One is _docile_ as a scholar; one is _tractable_ as a child or a servant. Where anything is to be learned, _docility_ is necessary; where anything is to be done at the call of another, _tractability_ is required. _Ductility_, from _duco_, to lead, signifies aptness to be led, and is applied to the mind or its powers, which yield readily to impressions.  
Animals may be said to be _docile_ and _tractable_ with a like distinction; inanimate objects, as metals, etc., may be _ductile._

####doctrine 
**DOCTRINE, PRECEPT, PRINCIPLE.**  
_Doctrine_, in French _doctrine_, Latin _doctrina_, from _docere_, to teach, signifies the thing taught; _precept_, from the Latin _prœ_, before, and _capere_, to take, signifies the thing placed before one as a guide to conduct. _Principle_ comes from French _principe_, Latin _principium_, the beginning of things, their first or original component parts.  
A _doctrine_ requires a teacher; a _precept_ requires a superior with authority; a _principle_ requires only a maintainer or holder. A _doctrine_ is always framed by some one; a _precept_ is enjoined or laid down by some one; a _principle_ lies in the thing itself. A _doctrine_ is composed of _principles;_ a _precept_ rests upon _principles_ or _doctrines._ Pythagoras taught the _doctrine_ of metempsychosis, and enjoined many _precepts_ on his disciples for the regulation of their conduct, particularly that they should abstain from eating animal food and be only silent hearers for the first five years of their scholarship: the former of these rules depended upon the preceding _doctrine_ of the soul's transmigration to the bodies of animals; the latter rested on that simple _principle_ of education, the entire devotion of the scholar to the master. We are said to believe in _doctrines_, to obey _precepts_, to imbibe or hold _principles. Doctrine_ is that which constitutes our faith; _precepts_ are that which directs the practice: both are the subjects of rational assent, and suited only to the matured understanding: _principles_ are often admitted without examination, and imbibed as frequently from observation and circumstances as from any direct personal efforts; children as well as men acquire _principles._  
**DOCTRINE, DOGMA, TENET.** — A _doctrine_ originates with an individual. _Dogma_, from the Greek _δόγμα_, and _δοκέω_, think, signifies something thought, admitted, or taken for granted) this lies with a body or number of individuals. _Tenet_, from the Latin _tenet_, he holds, signifies the thing held or maintained, and is a species of principle specifically maintained in matters of opinion by persons in general. A _doctrine_ rests on the authority of the individual by whom it is framed; the _dogma_, on the authority of the body by whom it is maintained; a _tenet_ rests on its own intrinsic merits. Many of the _doctrines_ of our blessed Saviour are held by faith in him; they are subjects of persuasion by the exercise of our rational powers; the _dogmas_ of the Romish Church are admitted by none but such as admit its authority: every sect has its peculiar _tenets._

####domicile 
**DOMICILE, HABITATION, HOME, HOUSE, RESIDENCE.**  
These words all signify a dwelling-place, but they differ in their application and in the dignity of their usage. _Domicile_, from Latin _domus_, home, is the Latin term corresponding to the native English _home_, Anglo-Saxon _ham. Home_ is the familiar and homely word, carrying with it all the emotional and imaginative connotations of the intimate communal life of those bound together by ties of birth and affection. _Domicile_ is the corresponding intellectual and "learned" word, meaning more than the mere externals of _home_ indicated in _habitation_ or _residence_, for instance, but emptied of all emotional content, and sometimes employed, like many Latin words in English, with a slightly humorous assumption of dignity. _Domicile_ is also used as a verb meaning "to make one's self at home. " _Habitation_, from Latin _habitare_, a frequentative of _habere_, to have, means simply a dwelling-place. _House_ also signifies a dwelling-place, but it is a more specific term than _habitation_, indicating a certain kind of permanent shelter, built for warmth and comfort. A _house_ is a _habitation;_ but a _habitation_ is not necessarily a _house. Tents, dug-outs, caves_, etc., may be _habitations._ Many people have a sentimental habit of substituting _home_ for the word _house_, when they mean merely the structure that may contain a _home._ "We have bought a new _home, "_ they say, meaning merely that they have bought a new _house to_ contain the old _home._ A _house_ is the outside shell of a _home. Residence_ is used to indicate a _house_ of some pretension and stateliness. We speak of a spacious _residence_, a handsome _residence_, etc. It may also be extended to refer simply in a general way to one's dwelling-place, as when we speak of _residence_ in the city, etc., not referring to any specific habitation, but merely the general idea of living or dwelling.

####doubt 
**DOUBT, QUESTION.**  
_Doubt_, in French _douter_, Latin _dubito_, from _duo_, two, and _ire_, past participle _itus_, to go, signifies a state in which the mind is going in two directions, as it were, or does not know which direction to take. _Question_, in Latin _quœstio_, from _quœrere_, to inquire, signifies to make a question.  
Both these terms express the act of the mind in staying its decision. _Doubt_ lies altogether in the mind; it is a less active feeling than _question:_ by the former we merely suspend decision; by the latter we actually demand proofs in order to assist us in deciding. We may _doubt_ in silence: we cannot _question_ without expressing it, directly or indirectly. He who suggests _doubts_ does it with caution: he who makes a _question_ throws in difficulties with a degree of confidence. _Doubts_ insinuate themselves on the part of the _doubter; questions_ are always made with an express design. We _doubt_ in matters of general interest, on abstruse as well as common subjects: we _question_ mostly in ordinary matters that are of a personal interest: we _doubt_ the truth of a position; we _question_ the veracity of an author. When the practicability of any plan is _questioned_, it is unnecessary to enter any further into its merits.  
The _doubt_ is frequently confined to the individual; the _question_ frequently respects others. We _doubt_ whether we shall be able to succeed; we _question_ another's right to interfere: we _doubt_ whether a thing will answer the end proposed; we _question_ the utility of any one making the attempt. There are many _doubtful_ cases in medicine, where the physician is at a loss to decide; there are many _questionable_ measures proposed by those who are in or out of power which demand consideration. A disposition to _doubt_ everything is more inimical to the cause of truth than the readiness to believe everything; a disposition to _question_ whatever is said or done by others is much more calculated to give offence than to prevent deception. See also [demur](entry://demur)  
_Doubt, Suspense,_ — _Doubt_ respects that which we should believe; _suspense_ that which we wish to know or ascertain. We are in _doubt_ for the want of evidence; we are in _suspense_ for the want of certainty. _Doubt_ interrupts our progress in the attainment of truth; _suspense_ impedes us in the attainment of our objects: the former is connected principally with the understanding; the latter acts altogether upon the hopes. We have our _doubts_ about things that have no regard to time; we are in _suspense_ about what is to happen in the future. Those are the least inclined to _doubt_ who have the most thorough knowledge of a subject; those are the least exposed to the unpleasant feeling of _suspense_ who confine their wishes to the present.  
See also [quandary](entry://quandary)  
**DOUBTFUL, DUBIOUS, UNCERTAIN, PRECARIOUS.** — The _doubtful_ admits of _doubt;_ the _dubious_ creates doubt or suspense. The _doubtful_ is said of things in which we are required to have an opinion; the _dubious_ respects events and things that must speak for themselves. In _doubtful_ cases it is advisable for a judge to lean to the side of mercy; while the issue of a contest is _dubious_, all judgment of the parties, or of the case, must be carefully avoided.  
_Doubtful_ and _dubious_ have always a relation to the person forming the opinion on the subject in question; _uncertain_ and _precarious_ are epithets which designate the qualities of the things themselves. Whatever is _uncertain_ may from that very circumstance be _doubtful_ or _dubious_ to these who attempt to determine upon them; but they may be designated for their _uncertainty_, without any regard to the opinions which they may give rise to. A person's coming may be _doubtful_ or _uncertain_, the length of his stay is oftener described as _uncertain_ than as _doubtful._ The _doubtful_ is opposed to that on which we form a positive conclusion, the _uncertain_ to that which is definite or prescribed. The efficacy of any medicine is _doubtful;_ the manner of its operation may be _uncertain._ While our knowledge is limited, we must expect to meet with many things that are _doubtful;_ as everything in the world is exposed to change, and all that is future is entirely above our control, we must naturally expect to find everything _uncertain_ but what we see passing before us.  
_Precarious_, from the Latin _precarius_, and _precare_, to pray, signifies granted to entreaty, depending on the will or humor of another, whence it is applicable to whatever is obtained from others. _Precarious_ is the highest species of _uncertainty_, applied to such things as depend on future casualties in opposition to that which is fixed and determined by design. The weather is _uncertain;_ the subsistence of a person who has no stated income or source of living must be _precarious._ It is _uncertain_ what day a thing may take place until it is determined; there is nothing more _precarious_ than what depends upon the favors of princes.

####draw 
**DRAW, DRAG, HAUL or HALE, PULL, PLUCK, TUG.**  
_Draw_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _dragan_, German _tragen_, to draw, and _drag_ is the Scandinavian form of the same word. _Haul_ or _hale_ comes through French from an Old High German word signifying to require or get. _Pull_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _pullian_, to pull or pluck. _Pluck_ is a Teutonic word which may possibly be borrowed from Late Latin _piluccare_, Italian _piluccare_, from _pilus_, hair (English _pile)_, meaning to pluck out hairs. _Tug_ is a Scandinavian word; compare Icelandic _tog_, a rope to pull by _Draw_ expresses here the idea common to the first three terms, namely, of putting a body in motion from behind one's self or toward one's self; to _drag_ is to _draw_ a thing with violence, or to _draw_ that which makes resistance; to _haul_ is to _drag_ it with still greater violence. We _draw_ a cart; we _drag_ a body along the ground; or _haul_ a vessel to the shore. To _pull_ signifies only an effort to _draw_ without the idea of motion: horses _pull_ very long sometimes before they can _draw_ a heavily laden cart uphill. To _pluck_ is to _pull_ with a sudden twitch, in order to separate; thus feathers are _plucked_ from animals. To _tug_ is to _pull_ with violence; thus men _tug_ at the oar.  
In the moral application of the words we may be said to be _drawn_ by anything which can act on the mind to bring us near to an object; we are _dragged_ only by means of force; we _pull_ a thing toward us by a direct effort. To _haul, pluck_, and _tug_ are seldom used but in physical application.

####dream 
**DREAM, REVERT.**  
_Dream_ is a word of uncertain origin apparently unrelated to the Anglo-Saxon _dream_, which meant joy, and allied to Old Norse _drauge_, a ghost, the radical meaning being a deceptive appearance, an illusion. Compare German _trügen_, to deceive. _Revery_, in French _réverie_, like the English _rave_ and the Latin _rabies_, madness, originally signified something wandering or incoherent.  
_Dreams_ and _reveries_ are alike opposed to the reality, and have their origin in the imagination; but the former commonly passes in sleep, and the latter when awake; the _dream_ may and does commonly arise when the imagination is in a sound state; the _revery_ is the fruit of a heated imagination: _dreams_ come in the course of nature; _reveries_ are the consequence of a peculiar ferment.  
When the term _dream_ is applied to the act of one that is awake it admits of another distinction from _revery._ They both designate what is confounded, but the _dream_ is less extravagant than the _revery._ Ambitious men please themselves with _dreams_ of future greatness; enthusiasts debase the purity of the Christian religion by blending their own wild _reveries_ with the doctrines of the Gospel. He who indulges himself in idle _dreams_ lays up a store of disappointment for himself when he recovers his recollection, and finds that it is nothing but a _dream:_ a love of singularity operating on an ardent mind will too often lead men to indulge in strange _reveries._

####dregs 
**DREGS, SEDIMENT, DROSS, SCUM, REFUSE.**  
_Dregs_ is a Scandinavian word; it is the plural form of a word which in Middle English means mire. _Sediment_, from _sedere_, to sit, signifies that which settles at the bottom. _Dross_ is a Germanic word; compare German _drusen_, meaning husks of grapes. _Scum_ comes from a Scandinavian word meaning froth or foam, and referred especially to the _scum_ thrown off from metals in the process of melting. _Refuse_ comes from Latin _re_, away, and _fundere_, to pour, signifying that which is poured out, thrown away.  
All these terms designate the worthless part of any body; but _dregs_ is taken in a worse sense than _sediment_, for the _dregs_ is that which is altogether of no value; but the _sediment_ may sometimes form a necessary part of the body. The _dregs_ are mostly a _sediment_ in liquors, but many things are a _sediment_ which are not _dregs._ After the _dregs_ are taken away, there will frequently remain a _sediment;_ the _dregs_ are commonly the corrupt part which separates from compound liquids, as wine or beer; the _sediment_ consists of the heavy particles which belong to all simple liquids, not excepting water itself. The _dregs_ and _sediment_ separate of themselves, but the _scum_ and _dross_ are forced out by a process; the former from liquids, and the latter from solid bodies rendered liquid or otherwise. _Dross_ is applied to solid bodies in the same sense as _scum_, being that which remains after the purifying, as the dross of corn after threshing and cleaning. _Refuse_, as its derivation implies, is always said of that which is intentionally separated to be thrown away, and agrees with the former terms only inasmuch as they express what is worthless. With this distinction they are figuratively applied to moral objects.

####drummer 
**DRUMMER, COMMERCIAL-TRAVELLER, SALESMAN, SOLICITOR.**  
_Drummer_ is a pure Americanism, supposed to have been derived from the old custom of having a man beat a drum to attract people to a circus, fair, show, recruiting-place, and the like, and signifies, literally one who drums up or summons people for a special purpose. Its general application is to a person employed by a manufacturer or merchant to solicit or "drum up trade, " to secure new customers, to open up new lines of business. The professional _drummer_ is not regarded in the same light as a _salesman._ The latter may be a graduated _drummer_, but his business is more particularly to keep in touch with the customers he has secured for his employer, ascertain the condition or amount of their stock of commodities he is interested in, and make such sales as he can.  
The _commercial-traveller_ and the _salesman_ are quite similar in quality, but with this difference: the former travels extensively and at regular seasons to meet his customers at their places of business, and the latter usually remains at the home house to meet the customers from other cities who come to his house for purchases, though he, too, may travel. Again, a _salesman_ may be an ordinary employee in a retail store who waits on and sells to ordinary patrons. The _drummer_ and _solicitor_ are also quite similar in quality, as both seek orders for goods from any one likely to buy, whether regular customers or strangers.

####dull 
**DULL, GLOOMY, SAD, DISMAL.**  
_Dull_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _dol_, foolish, German _toll_, mad. _Gloomy_ is in Middle English _gloumen_, to lower, and is allied to Norwegian _glyma_, an overcast sky; compare the adjective _glum. Sad_, Anglo-Saxon _sœd_, meant originally _sated;_ hence tired, dispirited, grieved. _Dismal_ comes from Latin _diesmali_, bad days, unlucky days.  
When applied to natural objects, _dull_ and _gloomy_ denote the want of necessary light or life: in this sense metals are more or less _dull_ according as they are stained with dirt: the weather is either _dull_ or _gloomy_ in different degrees, that is, _dull_ when the sun is obscured by clouds, and _gloomy_ when the atmosphere is darkened by fogs or thick clouds. _Dismal_ denotes not merely the want of that which is necessary, but also the presence of that which is repugnant to the senses; as a glare of light or a sound may be _dismal._ A room is _dull, gloomy_, or _dismal_, according to circumstances: it is _dull_ if the usual quantity of light and sound be wanting; it is _gloomy_ if the darkness and stillness be very considerable; it is _dismal_ if it have only light enough to show its wretchedness; in this sense a dungeon is a _dismal_ abode. _Sad_ is not applied so much to sensible as moral objects, in which sense the distressing events of human life, as the loss of a parent or a child, is justly denominated _sad._  
In regard to the frame of mind which is designated by these terms, it will be easily perceived from the above explanation. As slight circumstances produce _dulness_, any change, however small, in the usual flow of spirits may be termed _dull. Gloom_ weighs heavy on the mind, and gives a turn to the reflections and the imagination: desponding thoughts of futurity will spread a _gloom_ over every other object. _Sad_ indicates a wounded state of the heart, feelings of unmixed pain.

####durable 
**DURABLE, LASTING, PERMANENT.**  
_Durable_ is said of things that are intended to remain a shorter time than that which is _lasting;_ and _permanent_ expresses less than _durable. Durable_, from the Latin _durus_, hard, respects the texture of bodies and marks their capacity to hold out. _Lasting_ is _the_ participle of the verb _last_ from the Anglo-Saxon _lœstan_, to observe, perform, originally to follow in the track of, from _last_, a foot-track (found in the shoemaker's term — _last_ of a shoe). It is applicable to that which is of the longest duration. _Permanent_, from the Latin _per_, through, and _manere_, to remain, signifies remaining to the end.  
_Durable_ is naturally said of material substances, and _lasting_ of those which are spiritual, although in ordinary discourse sometimes they exchange offices: _permanent_ applies more to the affairs of men. That which perishes quickly is not _durable;_ that which ceases quickly is not _lasting;_ that which is only for a time is not _permanent._ Stone is more _durable_ than iron, and iron than wood: in the feudal times animosities between families used to be _lasting;_ a clerk has not a _permanent_ situation in an office.  
**DURABLE, CONSTANT.** — _Durability_ lies in the thing. _Constancy_ lies in the person. What is _durable_ is so from its inherent property; what is _constant_ is so by the power of the mind. No _durable_ connections can be formed where avarice or lust prevails. 

####duration 
**DURATION, TIME.**  
In the philosophical sense, according to Locke, _time_ is that mode of _duration_ which is formed in the mind by its own power of observing and measuring the passing objects. In the vulgar sense, in which _duration_ is synonymous with _time_, it stands for the time of _duration_, and is more particularly applicable to the objects which are said to last; _time_ being employed in general for whatever passes in the world.  
_Duration_ comprehends the beginning and end of any portion of _time_, that is, the how long of a thing; _time_ is employed more frequently for the particular portion itself, namely, the _time_ when: we mark the _duration_ of a sound from the _time_ of its commencement to the _time_ that it ceases; the _duration_ of a prince's reign is an object of particular concern to his subjects if he be either very good or the reverse; the _time_ in which he reigns is marked by extraordinary events: the historian computes the _duration_ of reigns and of events in order to determine the antiquity of a nation; he fixes the exact_ time_ when each person begins to reign and when he dies, in order to determine the number of years that each reigned.

####dutiful 
**DUTIFUL, OBEDIENT, RESPECTFUL.**  
_Dutiful_ signifies full of a sense of duty or full of what belongs to duty. _Obedient_ signifies ready to obey. _Respectful_ signifies literally full of respect.  
The _obedient_ and _respectful_ are but modes of the _dutiful:_ we may be _dutiful_ without being either _obedient_ or _respectful;_ but we are so far _dutiful_ as we are either _obedient_ or _respectful. Duty_ denotes what is due from one being to another: it is independent of all circumstances: _obedience_ and _respect_ are relative _duties_ depending upon the character and station of individuals: as we owe to no one so much as to our parents, we are said to be _dutiful_ to no earthly being besides; and in order to deserve the name of _dutiful_ a child, during the period of his childhood, ought to make a parent's will to be his law, and at no future period ought that will ever to be an object of indifference: we may be _obedient_ and _respectful_ to others besides our parents, although to them _obedience_ and _respect_ are in the highest degree and in the first case due; yet servants are enjoined to be _obedient_ to their masters, wives to their husbands, and subjects to their king. _Respectful_ is a term of still greater latitude than either; for as the characters of men as much as their stations demand _respect_, there is a _respectful_ deportment due toward every superior.  
**DUTY, OBLIGATION.** — _Duty_, as we see in the preceding section, consists altogether of what is right or due from one being to another. _Obligation_, from the Latin _obligo_, to bind, signifies the bond or necessity which lies in the thing.  
All _duty_ depends upon moral _obligation_ which subsists between man and man or man and his Maker; in this abstract sense, therefore, there can be no _duty_ without a previous _obligation_, and where there is an _obligation_ it involves a _duty;_ but in the vulgar acceptation, _duty_ is applicable to the conduct of men in their various relations; _obligation_ only to particular circumstances or modes of action: we have _duties_ to perform as parents and children, as husbands and wives, as rulers and subjects, as neighbors and citizens: the debtor is under an _obligation_ to discharge a debt; and he who had promised is under an _obligation_ to fulfil his promise: a conscientious man, therefore, never loses sight of the _obligations_ which he has at different times to discharge. The _duty_ is not so peremptory as the _obligation;_ the _obligation_ is not so lasting as the _duly:_ our affections impel us to the discharge of _duty;_ interest or necessity impels us to the discharge of an _obligation:_ it may therefore sometimes happen that the man whom a sense of _duty_ cannot actuate to do that which is right will not be able to withstand the _obligation_ under which he has laid himself.

####eager 
**EAGER, EARNEST, SERIOUS.**  
_Eager_ (see [avidity](entry://avidity).) _Earnest_, Anglo-Saxon _earnest_, meaning earnestness, comes from a root found in Greek _ορνυμι_, to excite, and in Icelandic _arnbrick_, implying intensity of spirit; not the same as _pledge_ (see below). Serious, Latin _serius_, grave, earnest, may possibly be allied to German _schwer_, heavy.  
_Eager_ is used to qualify the desires or passions; _earnest_, to qualify the wishes or sentiments; the former has either a physical or moral application, the latter altogether a moral application: a child is _eager_ to get a plaything; a hungry person is _eager_ to get food; a covetous man is _eager_ to seize whatever comes within his grasp: a person is _earnest_ in solicitation, _earnest_ in exhortation, _earnest_ in devotion. _Eagerness_ is mostly faulty; it cannot be too early restrained in children. Whence this term is with particular propriety applied to brutes.  
_Earnestness_ is always taken in the good sense for the inward conviction of the mind, accompanied with the warmth of the heart in a good cause. A person is said to be _earnest_, or in _earnest;_ a person or thing is said to be _serious:_ the former characterizes the temper of the mind, the latter characterizes the object itself. In regard to persons, in which alone they are to be compared, _earnest_ expresses more than _serious;_ the former is opposed to lukewarmness, the latter to unconcernedness: we are _earnest_ as to our wishes or our persuasions; we are _serious_ as to our intentions: the _earnestness_ with which we address another depends upon the force of our conviction; the _seriousness_ with which we address them depends upon our sincerity and the nature of the subject: the preacher _earnestly_ exhorts his hearers to lay aside their sins; he _seriously_ admonishes those who are guilty of irregularities.  
**EARNEST, PLEDGE.** — In the proper sense the _earnest_, compounded of Old French _erres, arres_, from Latin _arrha_ and a diminutive, is given as a token of our being in _earnest_ in the promise we have made; the _pledge_, in all probability from _plico_, to fold or implicate, signifies a security by which we are engaged to indemnify for a loss. When a contract is only verbally formed, it is usual to give _earnest;_ whenever money is advanced, it is common to give a _pledge._  
In the figurative application the terms bear the same analogy: a man of genius sometimes, though not always, gives an _earnest_ in youth of his future greatness; children are the dearest _pledges_ of affection between parents.

####ease 
**EASE, QUIET, REST, REPOSE.**  
_Ease_ comes from the French _aise_, a word of unknown origin. _Quiet_ is derived from Latin _quietus_, quiet. _Rest_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _rest_, originally, perhaps, a halting-place. _Repose_ comes from Latin _re_, back, and French _poser_, to place, from Late Latin _pausare_, allied to _pause;_ it means to place one's self backward in an easy posture.  
The idea of a motionless state is common to all these terms: _ease_ and _quiet_ respect action on the body; _rest_ and _repose_ respect the action of the body: we are _easy_ or _quiet_ when freed from any external agency that is painful; we have _rest_ or _repose_ when the body is no longer in motion. _Ease_ denotes an exemption from any painful agency in general; _quiet_ denotes an exemption from that in particular which noise, disturbance, or the violence of others may cause: we are _easy_ or at _ease_ when the body is in a posture agreeable to itself, or when no circumjacent object presses unequally upon it; we are _quiet_ when there is an agreeable stillness around: our ease may be disturbed either by internal or external causes; our _quiet_ is most commonly disturbed by external objects.  
_Best_ simply denotes the cessation of motion; _repose_ is that species of _rest_ which is agreeable after labor: we _rest_ as circumstances require; in this sense, our Creator is said to have _rested_ from the work of creation: _repose_ is a circumstance of necessity; the weary seek _repose;_ there is no human being to whom it is not sometimes indispensable. We may _rest_ in a standing posture; we can _repose_ only in a lying position: the dove which Noah first sent out could not find _rest_ for the sole of its foot; soldiers who are hotly pursued by an enemy have no time or opportunity to take _repose:_ the night is the time for _rest;_ the pillow is the place for _repose. Rest_ may be as properly applied to things as to persons; _repose_ is figuratively applied to things.  
**EASE, EASINESS, FACILITY, LIGHTNESS.** — _Ease_ denotes either the abstract state of a person or quality of a thing; _easiness_, from _easy_, signifying having _ease_, denotes simply an abstract quality which serves to characterize the thing; a person enjoys _ease_, or he has an _easiness_ of disposition.  
_Ease_ is said of that which is borne, or that which is done; _easiness_ and _facility_, from the Latin _facilis_, easy, from _facere_, to do, most commonly of that which is done; the former in application to the thing as before, the latter either to the person or the thing: we speak of the _easiness_ of the task, but of a person's _facility_ in doing it: we judge of the _easiness_ of a thing by comparing it with others more difficult; we judge of a person's _facility_ by comparing him with others who are less skilful.  
_Ease_ and _lightness_ are both said of what is to be borne; the former in a general, the latter in a particular sense. Whatever presses in any form is not _easy;_ that which presses by excess of weight is not _light:_ a coat may be _easy_ from its make; it can be _light_ only from its texture. A work is _easy_ which requires no particular effort either of body or of mind from any one performing it; a work is _light_ as far as it requires no bodily effort, or not more than what the individual can easily make who has to perform it.  
The same distinction exists between their derivatives, to _ease, facilitate_, and _lighten;_ to _ease_ is to make _easy_ or free from pain, as to _ease_ a person of his labor; to _facilitate_ is to render a thing more practicable or less difficult, as to _facilitate_ a person's progress; to _lighten_ is to take off an excessive weight, as to _lighten_ a person's burdens.  
**EASY, READY.** — _Easy_ signifies here a freedom from obstruction in ourselves. _Ready_ is derived from _rœde_, which meant literally equipped for _riding_, prepared for a _raid_ — all these words coming from the same root.  
_Easy_ marks the freedom of being done; _ready_, the disposition or willingness to do; the former refers mostly to the thing or the manner, the latter to the person; the thing is _easy_ to be done: the person is _ready_ to do it; it is _easy_ to make professions of friendship in the ardor of the moment; but every one is not _ready_ to act up to them when it interferes with his convenience or interest. As epithets, both are opposed to difficult, but agreeably to the above explanation of the terms; the former denotes a freedom from such difficulties or obstacles as lie in the nature of the thing itself; the latter an exemption from such as lie in the temper and character of the person; hence we say a person is _easy_ of access whose situation, rank, employments, or circumstances do not prevent him from admitting others to his presence; he is _ready_ to hear when he himself throws no obstacles in the way, when he lends a willing ear to what is said. So likewise a task is said to be _easy;_ a person's wit, or a person's reply, to be _ready._

####ebullition 
**EBULLITION, EFFERVESCENCE, FERMENTATION, FERMENT.**  
These technical terms have a strong resemblance in their signification, but they are not strictly synonymous; they have strong characteristic differences. _Ebullition_, from the Latin _ebullitio_ and _ebullio_, compounded of _e_ and _bullire_, to bubble, boil, marks the commotion of a liquid acted upon by fire, and in chemistry it is said of two substances which, by penetrating each other, occasion bubbles to rise up. _Effervescence_, from the Latin _effervescentia_, and _effervescere_, to grow hot, marks the commotion which is excited in liquors by a combination of substances, such as of acids, which are mixed and commonly produce heat. _Ferment_, or _fermentation_, from the Latin _fermentatio_ and _fermentum_ or _fervimentum_, from _fervere_, to grow hot, marks the internal movement which is excited in a liquid of itself, by which its components undergo such a change or decomposition as to form a new body.  
_Ebullition_ is a more violent action than _effervescence; ferment_ and _fermentation_ are more gradual and permanent than either. Water is exposed to _ebullition_ when acted upon by any powerful degree of external heat; iron in aqua-fortis occasions _effervescence;_ beer and wine undergo a _ferment_ or _fermentation_ before they reach a state of perfection. These terms are applied figuratively to moral objects. The passions are exposed to _ebullitions;_ the heart and affections to _effervescence_ when powerfully awakened by particular objects. The minds or spirits, particularly of numbers, may be in a _ferment_ or _fermentation._ If the angry humors of an irascible temper be not restrained in early life, they but too frequently break forth in the most dreadful _ebullitions_ in maturer years; religious zeal, when not constrained by the sober exercise of judgment and corrected by sound knowledge, is an unhappy _effervescence_ that injures the cause which it espouses and often proves fatal to the individual by whom it is indulged: the _ferment_ produced by public measures may often endanger the public peace. 

####eccentric 
See [erratic](entry://erratic); [particular](entry://particular)

####ecclesiastic 
**ECCLESIASTIC, DIVINE, THEOLOGIAN.**  
An _ecclesiastic_ derives his title from the office which he bears in the _ecclesia_, or church; a _divine_ and _theologian_, from his pursuit after or engagement in _divine_ or _theological_ matters. An _ecclesiastic_ is connected with an episcopacy; a _divine_ or _theologian_ is unconnected with any form of church government. An _ecclesiastic_ need not in his own person perform any office, although he fills a station; a _divine_ not only fills a station, but actually performs the office of teaching; a _theologian_ neither fills any particular station nor discharges any specific duty, but merely follows the pursuit of studying _theology._ An _ecclesiastic_ is not always a _divine_, nor a _divine_ an _ecclesiastic;_ a _divine_ is always more or less a _theologian_, but every _theologian_ is not a _divine._ Among the Roman Catholics all monks, and in the Church of England the various dignitaries who perform the episcopal functions, are entitled _ecclesiastics._ There are but few denominations of Christians who have not appointed teachers who are called _divines._ Professors or writers on _theology_ are peculiarly denominated _theologians._

####eclipse 
**ECLIPSE, OBSCURE.**  
_Eclipse_, from Greek _έκ_, out, and _λείπειν_, to leave, means the leaving out or vanishing of light. _Obscure_, from the adjective _obscure_ (see [dark](entry://dark)), signifies to cause the intervention of a shadow.  
In the natural as well as the moral application _eclipse_ is taken in a particular and relative signification; _obscure_ is used in a general sense. Heavenly bodies are _eclipsed_ by the intervention of other bodies between them and the beholder; things are in general _obscured_ which are in any way rendered less striking or visible. To _eclipse_ is therefore a species of _obscuring:_ that is always _obscured_ which is _eclipsed;_ but everything is not _eclipsed_ which is _obscured._ So, figuratively, real merit is _eclipsed_ by the intervention of superior merit; it is often _obscured_ by an ungracious exterior in the possessor or by his unfortunate circumstances. 

####economical 
**ECONOMICAL, SAVING, SPARING, THRIFTY, PENURIOUS, NIGGARDLY.**  
The idea of not spending is common to all these terms; but _economical_ signifies not spending unnecessarily or unwisely. _Saving_ is keeping and laying by with care; _sparing_ is keeping out of that which ought to be spent; _thrifty_ or _thriving_ is accumulating by means of _saving; penurious_ is suffering as from _penury by_ means of _saving; niggardly_, after the manner of a _niggard_, nigh or close person, is not spending or letting go but in the smallest possible quantities. To be _economical_ is a virtue in those who have but narrow means; all the other epithets, however, are employed in a sense more or less unfavorable; he who is _saving_ when young will be avaricious when old; he who is _sparing_ will generally be _sparing_ out of the comforts of others; he who is _thrifty_ commonly adds the desire of getting with that of _saving;_ he who is _penurious_ wants nothing to make him a complete miser; he who is _niggardly_ in his dealings will be mostly avaricious in his character.  
**ECONOMY, FRUGALITY, PARSIMONY.** — _Economy_, from the Greek _οίκονομία_, the management of a house, is derived from Greek οίκος, house, and _νέμειν_, to deal out. _Frugality_, from the Latin _fruges_, fruits, means subsisting on the fruits of the earth, hence temperance. _Parsimony_ (see [avaricious](entry://avaricious)) implies simply forbearing to spend, which is in fact the common idea included in these terms; but the _economical_ man spares expense according to circumstances; he adapts his expenditure to his means and renders it by contrivance as effectual to his purpose as possible; _the frugal_ man spares expense on himself or on his indulgences; he may, however, be liberal to others while he is _frugal_ toward himself as well as others; he has no other object than saving. By _economy_ a man may make a limited income turn to the best account for himself and his family; by _frugality_ he may with a limited income be enabled to lay by money; by _parsimony_ he may be enabled to accumulate great sums out of a narrow income; hence it is that we recommend a plan for being _economical;_ we recommend a diet for being _frugal;_ we condemn a habit or a character for being _parsimonious._  
**ECONOMY, MANAGEMENT.** — _Economy_ has a more comprehensive meaning than _management;_ for it includes the system, of science and of legislation as well as that of domestic arrangements: as the _economy_ of agriculture; the internal _economy_ of a government; political, civil, or religious _economy:_ or the _economy_ of one's household. _Management_, on the contrary, is an action that is very seldom abstracted from its agent, and is always taken in a partial sense, namely, as a part of _economy._ The internal _economy_ of a family depends principally on the prudent _management_ of the female: the _economy_ of every well-regulated community requires that all the members should keep their station and preserve a strict subordination; the _management_ of particular branches of this _economy_ should belong to particular individuals. 

####economize 
See [husband](entry://husband)

####ecstasy 
**ECSTASY, RAPTURE, TRANSPORT.**  
There is a strong resemblance in the meaning and application of these words. They all express an extraordinary elevation of the spirits or an excessive tension of the mind. _Ecstasy_ marks a passive state, from the Greek _έκστασις_, from _έκ_, out, and _ϊσταμαι_, I stand, means to be out of one's self, out of one's mind. _Rapture_, from the Latin _rapere_, to seize or carry away; and _transport_, from _trans_ and _portare_, to carry beyond one's self, rather designate an active state, a violent impulse with which it hurries itself forward. _Ecstasy_ and _rapture_ are always pleasurable, or arise from pleasurable causes; _transport_ respects either pleasurable or painful feelings: joy occasions _ecstasies_ or _raptures;_ joy and anger have their _transports._ An _ecstasy_ benumbs the faculties; it will take away the power of speech and often of thought; it is commonly occasioned by sudden and unexpected events: _rapture_, on the other hand, often invigorates the powers and calls them into action; it frequently arises from deep thought: the former is common to all persons of ardent feelings, but more particularly to children, ignorant people, or to such as have not their feelings under control; _rapture_, on the contrary, is applicable to persons with superior minds and to circumstances of peculiar importance. _Transports_ are sudden bursts of passion which, from their vehemence, may lead to intemperate actions: a reprieve from the sentence of death will produce an _ecstasy_ or delight in the pardoned criminal. Religious contemplation is calculated to produce holy _raptures_ in a mind strongly imbued with pious zeal: in _transports_ of rage men have committed enormities which have cost them bitter tears of repentance ever after: youth is the period in which _transports_ of delight are mostly felt.

####edifice 
**EDIFICE, STRUCTURE, FABRIC.**  
_Edifice_, in Latin _œdificium_, from _œdifico_, or _œdes_, a house, and _facere_, to make, signifies properly the house made. _Structure_, from the Latin _structura_, and _struere_, to heap together, signifies the raising a thing or the thing raised. _Fabric_ comes from Latin _faber_, a workman, from a base signifying skill, and means something made by skill.  
_Edifice_ in its proper sense is always applied to a building; _structure_ and _fabric_ are either employed as abstract actions or the results and fruits of actions: in the former case they are applied to many objects besides buildings, _structure_ referring to the act of raising or setting up together, _fabric_ to that of framing or contriving. As _edifice_ bespeaks the thing itself, it requires no modification, since it conveys of itself the idea of something superior: the word _structure_ must always be qualified; it is employed only to designate the mode of action; _fabric_ is itself a species of epithet, it designates the object as something contrived by the power of art or by design. _Edifices_ dedicated to the service of religion have in all ages been held sacred: it is the business of the architect to estimate the merits or demerits of any _structure;_ when we take a survey of the vast _fabric_ of the universe, the mind becomes bewildered with contemplating the infinite power of its Divine author.  
When employed in the abstract sense of actions, _structure_ is limited to objects of magnitude, or such as consist of complicated parts: _fabric_ is extended to everything in which art or contrivance is requisite; hence we may speak of the _structure_ of vessels, and the _fabric_ of cloth, ironware, or the _fabric_ of states, the universe, etc. 

####education 
**EDUCATION, INSTRUCTION, BREEDING.**  
_Instruction_ and _breeding_ are to _education_ as parts to a whole: _instruction_ respects the communication of knowledge, and _breeding_ respects the manners or outward conduct; but _education_ comprehends not only both these, but the formation of the mind, the regulation of the heart, and the establishment of the principles: good _instruction_ makes one wiser; good _breeding_ makes one more polished and agreeable; good _education_ makes one really good. A want of _education_ will always be to the injury, if not to the ruin, of the sufferer: a want of _instruction_ is of more or less inconvenience, according to circumstances; a want of _breeding_ only unfits a man for the society of the cultivated. _Education_ belongs to the period of childhood and youth; _instruction_ may be given at different ages; _good-breeding_ is best learned in the early part of life. 

####efface 
See [blot](entry://blot)

####effect 
**EFFECT, PRODUCE, PERFORM.**  
The latter two are in reality included in the former; what is _effected_ is both _produced_ and _performed;_ but what is _produced_ or _performed_ is not always _effected._ To _effect_, in Latin _effectus_, participle of _efficio_, compounded of _ex_, out, and _facere_, to make, signifies to make out anything. To _produce_, from the Latin _pro_, forth, and _ducere_, to draw, signifies literally to draw forth. To _perform_, Old French _parfournir_, from Latin _per_, through, and Old High German _frumjan_, to provide, French _fournir_, English _furnish_, signifies to do or provide everything necessary.  
To _produce_ signifies to bring something forth or into existence; to _perform_ to do something to the end: to _effect_ is to _produce_ an effect by _performing;_ whatever is _effected is_ the consequence of a specific design; it always requires, therefore, a rational agent to _effect:_ what is _produced_ may follow incidentally, or arise from the action of an irrational agent or an inanimate object; what is _performed_ is done by specific efforts; it is, therefore, like _effect_, the consequence of design, and requires a rational agent. To _effect_ respects both the end and the means by which it is brought about; to _produce_ respects the end only; to _perform_ the means only. No person ought to calculate on _effecting_ a reformation in the morals of men without the aid of religion; changes both in individuals and communities are often _produced_ by trifles.  
To _effect_ is said of that which emanates from the mind of the agent himself; to _perform_, of that which is marked out by rule or prescribed by another. We _effect_ a purpose, we _perform_ a part, a duty, or office. A true Christian is always happy when he can _effect_ a reconciliation between parties who are at variance: it is a laudable ambition to strive to _perform_ one's part creditably in society.  
See also [accomplish](entry://accomplish); [consequence](entry://consequence)  
**EFFECTIVE, EFFICIENT, EFFECTUAL, EFFICACIOUS.** — _Effective_ signifies capable of _effecting; efficient_ signifies, literally, _effecting; effectual_ and _efficacious_ signify having the _effect_, or possessing the power to _effect. Effective_ and _efficient_ are used only in regard to physical objects: an army or a revenue is _effective_ that can be employed to _effect_ any object: a cause is _efficient_ that is adequate to produce an _effect. Effectual_ and _efficacious_ are said of operations and intellectual objects: an end or result is _effectual;_ the means are _efficacious:_ a remedy or cure is _effectual_ that is in reality effected; a medicine is _efficacious_ that effects a cure. No _effectual_ stop can be put to the vices of the lower orders while they have a vicious example from their superiors: a seasonable exercise of severity on an offender is often very _efficacious_ in quelling a spirit of insubordination. When a thing is not found _effectual_, it is requisite to have recourse to further measures; that which has been proved to be _inefficacious_ should never be adopted.

####effusion 
**EFFUSION, EJACULATION.**  
_Effusion_ signifies the thing poured out, from _ex_, out, and _fundere_, to pour, and _ejaculation_, the thing ejaculated or thrown out, from _ex_, out, and _iacere_, to throw, both indicating a species of verbal expression; the former either by utterance or in writing; the latter only by utterance. The _effusion_ is not so vehement or sudden as the _ejaculation;_ the _ejaculation_ is not so ample or diffuse as the _effusion; effusion_ is seldom taken in a good sense; _ejaculation_ rarely otherwise. An _effusion_ commonly flows from a heated imagination uncorrected by the judgment; it is, therefore, in general not only incoherent, but extravagant and senseless: an _ejaculation_ is produced by the warmth of the moment, but never without reference to some particular circumstance. Enthusiasts are full of extravagant _effusions;_ contrite sinners will often express their penitence in pious _ejaculations._

####elderly 
**ELDERLY, AGED, OLD.**  
These three words rise by gradation in their sense; _aged_ denotes a greater degree of _age_ than _elderly_, and _old_ still more than either. The _elderly_ man has passed the meridian of life; the _aged_ man is fast approaching the term of our existence; the _old_ man has already reached this term or has exceeded it. In conformity, however, to the vulgar prepossession against _age_ and its concomitant infirmities, the term _elderly_ or _aged_ is always more respectful than _old_, which latter word is often used by way of reproach, and can seldom be used free from such an association unless qualified by an epithet of praise, as good or venerable. 

####elect 
See [choose](entry://choose)

####electric 
**ELECTRIC, MAGNETIC.**  
_Electric_ comes from Latin _electrum_, Greek _ήλεκτρον_, amber; and derives its present meaning from the fact that amber developed electricity when excited by friction. _Magnetic_ referred to a similar property observed in the magnesian stone, so called because it was found in large quantities in magnesia. This stone had the power to attract iron and steel. Both words originally referred to the attractive power associated with certain substances under certain conditions. But, as the science of electricity has developed, _magnetic_ has been associated with the properties of the _magnet_ and _electric_ with a force or current existent or generated under certain conditions. When used figuratively _electric_ refers to the swift and thrilling quality of _electricity, magnetic_ to a quality of attractiveness associated with the mysterious thrill of electrical force. 

####elegant 
See [superb](entry://superb)

####elementary 
**ELEMENTARY, CONSTITUENT, PRIMARY, RUDIMENTARY.**  
_Elementary_ is the adjective corresponding to _element_, Latin _elementum_, a word whose etymology and primary meaning are uncertain, but which is used to indicate one of the simple substances of which all material bodies are compounded. _Constituent_, from Latin _con_, together, and _statuere_, to set up, indicates that which when joined to something else goes to make up a complex whole. But it does not indicate a simple or uncompounded substance, as does _elementary. Primary_, from Latin _primus_, first, means the first elements, the things absolutely necessary to form a contemplated whole; but it does not definitely suggest the combination of substances as does _constituent. Rudimentary_, from Latin _rudimentum_, from _rudis_, rough, indicates the first rude state of things. These words, therefore, all mean characteristic of that which is necessary to the formation of a complex whole; but they differ in the emphasis upon the character of the thing indicated, and its relation to a larger whole. 

####elevate 
See [lift](entry://lift)

####eligible 
**ELIGIBLE, PREFERABLE.**  
_Eligible_, or fit to be elected, and _preferable_, fit to be preferred, serve as epithets in the sense of choose and prefer (see [choose](entry://choose); [prefer](entry://prefer)); what is _eligible_ is desirable in itself, what is _preferable_ is more desirable than another. There may be many _eligible_ situations, out of which perhaps there is but one _preferable._ Of persons, however, we say rather that they are _eligible_ to an office than _preferable._

####elocution 
**ELOCUTION, ELOQUENCE, ORATORY, RHETORIC.**  
_Elocution_ and _eloquence_ are derived from the same Latin verb, _eloqui_, from _ex_, out, and _loqui_, to speak, to speak out. _Oratory_, from _orare_, to implore, signifies the art of making a set speech.  
_Elocution_ consists in the manner of delivery; _eloquence_ in the matter that is delivered. We employ _elocution_ in repeating the words of another; we employ _eloquence_ to express our own thoughts and feelings. _Elocution_ is requisite for an actor; _eloquence_ for a speaker.  
_Eloquence_ lies in the person: it is a natural gift: _oratory_ lies in the mode of expression; it is an acquired art. _Rhetoric_ is properly the theory of that art of which _oratory_ is the practice. But the term _rhetoric_ may be sometimes employed in an improper sense for the display of _oratory_ or scientific speaking. _Eloquence_ speaks one's own feelings; it comes from the heart and speaks to the heart: _oratory_ is an imitative art; it describes what is felt by another. _Rhetoric_ is either in the technical sense the science of _oratory_, or _oratory_ reduced to rule, or, in the vulgar acceptation, it is the affectation of _oratory._

####emancipate 
**EMANCIPATE, ENFRANCHISE, UNSHACKLE.**  
_Emancipate_ comes from Latin _emancipare, e manibus capere_, to take out of the hands of, and referred to the provision made in Roman law for freeing a child or a wife from the power of the father or husband. It also referred to the freeing of slaves. _Enfranchise_ comes from Old French _franchise_, privileged liberty, and referred especially to the admitting of a slave or a serf to personal freedom. The two words have therefore almost exactly the same meaning, but _enfranchise_ has also been given the special significance of to admit to the full rights of a citizen, especially to grant the right to vote. Hence when we speak of the _emancipation_ of the negro slaves, we refer to the decree of the President delivering them from the power of their masters. When we speak of their _enfranchisement_, we refer to the passing of the amendment to the Constitution of the United States granting them the right to vote. _Unshackle_ is a figurative word from _shackle_ (see [chain](entry://chain)), meaning to deliver from shackles, and may be used to mean either _emancipate_ or _enfranchise_ or _free_ in a still larger sense. See [free](entry://free)

####embargo 
**EMBARGO, BAN, PROHIBITION.**  
_Embargo_, Spanish _embargo_, from _barra_, a bar, means a prohibiting order, forbidding the ships of a foreign power to enter or leave the ports of a country or native ships to proceed there, generally issued in anticipation of war. It also indicates a suspension of commerce by municipal law. _Ban_ is an older term of Germanic origin signifying a formal edict — a call to arms, an announcement of intention to marry, or an ecclesiastical excommunication. _Prohibition_ (for derivation see [ban](entry://ban)) is used in a special sense to refer to the forbidding of the sale of alcoholic liquor by the law of a community. It refers to a special embargo on alcoholic drink. See also [intern](entry://intern)

####embarrass 
**EMBARRASS, PERPLEX, ENTANGLE.**  
_Embarrass_ (see **difficulty** under [difficult](entry://difficult)) respects a person's manners or circumstances, _perplex_ (see [distress](entry://distress)), his views and conduct; _entangle_ (see [disengage](entry://disengage)) is said of particular circumstances. _Embarrassments_ depend altogether on ourselves; the want of prudence and presence of mind is the common cause; _perplexities_ depend on extraneous circumstances as well as ourselves; extensive dealings with others are mostly attended with _perplexities; entanglements_ arise mostly from the evil designs of others. That _embarrasses_ which interrupts the even course or progress of one's actions: that _perplexes_ which interferes with one's decisions: that _entangles_ which binds a person in his actions. Pecuniary difficulties _embarrass_, or contending feelings produce _embarrassment;_ contrary counsels or interests _perplex;_ the artifices of cunning _entangle._ Steadiness of mind prevents _embarrassment_ in the outward behavior. Firmness of character is requisite in the midst of _perplexities;_ caution must be employed to guard against _entanglements._

####embryo 
**EMBRYO, FŒTUS.**  
_Embryo_, in French _embryon_, Greek _ε̋μβρυον_, from _βρύειν_, to swell out or germinate, signines the thing germinated. _Fœtus_, Latin _fœtus_, comes from an obsolete Latin verb signifying to generate or produce, and signifies the thing cherished. Both words refer to what is formed in the womb of the mother; but _embryo_ properly implies the first-fruit of conception, and the _fœtus_ that which is arrived to a maturity of formation. Anatomists tell us that the _embryo_ in the human subject assumes the character of the _fœtus_ about the forty-second day after conception.  
_Fœtus_ is applicable only in its proper sense to animated beings: _embryo_ has a figurative application to plants and fruits when they remain in a confused and imperfect state, and also a moral application to plans, or whatever is roughly conceived in the mind.

####emissary 
**EMISSARY, SPY.**  
_Emissary_, in Latin _emissarius_, from _emittere_, to send forth, signifies one sent out. _Spy_ is a shortened form of _espy_, which comes through French _espier_, from Old High German _spehon_, German _spähen_, to _spy._  
Both these words designate a person sent out by a body on some public concern among their enemies; but they differ in their office according to the etymology of the words. The _emissary_ is by distinction sent forth; he is sent so as to mix with the people to whom he goes, to be in all places, and to associate with every one individually as may serve his purpose; the _spy_, on the other hand, takes his station wherever he can best perceive what is passing; he keeps himself at a distance from all but such as may particularly aid him in the object of his search. Although the offices of _emissary_ and _spy_ are neither of them honorable, yet that of the former is more disgraceful than that of the latter. The _emissary is_ generally employed by those who have some illegitimate object to pursue; _spies_, on the other hand, are employed by all regular governments in a time of warfare. Nations that are at war sometimes send _emissaries_ into the states of the enemy to excite civil commotions. At Sparta, the trade of a _spy_ was not so vile as it has been generally esteemed; it was considered as a self-devotion for the public good, and formed a part of their education.  
These terms are applied to other objects figuratively.

####emit 
**EMIT, EXHALE, EVAPORATE.**  
_Emit_, from the Latin _emittere_, expresses properly the act of sending out; _exhale_, from _halitus_, the breath, and _evaporate_, from _vapor_, vapor or steam, are both modes of _emitting. Emit_ is used to express a more positive effort to send out; _exhale_ and _evaporate_ designate the natural and progressive process of things; volcanoes _emit_ fire and lava; the earth _exhales_ the damps, or flowers _exhale_ perfumes; liquids _evaporate._ Animals may _emit_ by an act of volition; things _exhale_ or _evaporate_ by an external action upon them; they _exhale_ that which is foreign to them; they _evaporate_ that which constitutes a part of their substance. The skunk _emits_ such a stench from itself when pursued as to keep its pursuers at à distance from itself: bogs and fens _exhale_ their moisture when acted upon by the heat: water _evaporates_ by means of steam when put into a state of ebullition.

####empire 
**EMPIRE, KINGDOM, REPUBLIC.**  
Although the first two words obviously refer to two species of states, where the princes assume the title of either emperor or king, yet the difference between them is not limited to this distinction.  
The word _empire_ carries with it the idea of a state that is vast and composed of many different people; that of _kingdom_ marks a state more limited in extent and united in its composition. In _kingdoms_ there is a uniformity of fundamental laws, the difference in regard to particular laws or modes of jurisprudence being merely variations from custom, which do not affect the unity of political administration. From this uniformity, indeed, in the functions of government, we may trace the origin of the words _king_ and _kingdoms_ since there is but one prince or sovereign ruler, although there may be many employed in the administration. With _empires_ it is different: one part is sometimes governed by fundamental laws very different from those by which another part of the same _empire_ is governed, which diversity destroys the unity of government and makes the union of the state to consist in the submission of certain chiefs in the commands of a superior general or chief. From this very right of commanding, then, it is evident that the words _empire_ and _emperor_ derive their origin; and hence it is that there may be many princes or sovereigns, and _kingdoms_, in the same _empire._ Rome, therefore, was first a _kingdom_ while it was formed of only one people: it acquired the name of _empire_ as soon as other nations were brought into subjection to it and became members of it, not by losing the distinctive character as nations, but by submitting themselves to the supreme command of their conquerors. For the same reason the German _empire_ was so denominated because it consisted of several states independent of one another, yet all subject to one ruler or emperor; so likewise the Russian _empire_, the Ottoman _empire_, and the former Mogul _empire_, which were composed of different nations: and, on the other hand, the _kingdom_ of Spain and of England, both of which, though divided into different provinces, were, nevertheless, one people, having but one ruler. While France, however, included many distinct countries within its jurisdiction, it properly assumed the name of an _empire_, and, with Portugal later, took the name of _republic;_ and England, having by a legislative act united to itself a country distinct both in its laws and customs, has likewise, with equal propriety, been denominated the British _empire._  
The term _republic_ applies both to countries as vast as the United States, Brazil, and Mexico, as several in Europe, and also to smaller ones, as those in Central and South America and some parts of Europe; and the term represents the form of government, the supreme authority being chosen or delegated by the people instead of being hereditary in a single family. **EMPIRE, REIGN, DOMINION.** — In the preceding article _empire_ has been considered as a species of state: in the present case it conveys the idea of power or an exercise of sovereignty. In this sense it is allied to the word _reign_, which, from the verb to _reign_, signifies the act of _reigning;_ and to the word _dominion_, which, from the Latin _dominus_, a lord, signifies either the power or the exercise of the power of a lord.  
As _empire_ signifies command, or the power exercised in commanding, it properly refers to the country or people commanded; and as _reign_ signifies the act of reigning, it refers to the individual who reigns. If we speak of an extended _empire_, it has regard to the space over which it extends; if of an extended _reign_, it has regard either to the country reigned over or to the length of time that a prince reigns.  
From this distinction of the terms the epithets vast, united, dismemberized, and the like are most appropriately applied to _empire;_ the epithets peaceful, warlike, glorious, prosperous, and the like, to _reign. Empire_ and _reign_ are properly applied to civil government or the exercise of regular power; _dominion_ signifies either the act of ruling by a sovereign or a private individual, or the power exercised in ruling, which may Be either regular or irregular; a sovereign may have _dominion_ over many nations by force of arms; he holds his _reign_ by force of law.  
If _empire_ and _reign_ be extended in their application to other objects, it is figurative; thus a female may be said to hold her _empire_ among her admirers, or fashions may be said to have their _reign. Dominion_ may be applied in the proper sense to the power which man exercises over the brutes or inanimate objects, and figuratively to the power of the passions.  
In countries under the republican form of government the entire body of citizens constitute the sovereignty. They choose the Congress, which is the highest lawmaking authority, and elect the President, who is the chief executive of the laws. 

####empirical 
**EMPIRICAL, EXPERIMENTAL, HYPOTHETICAL, PROVISIONAL, TENTATIVE.**  
All these words mean "not yet established as an absolute fact, but serving as a working basis" for further discovery. But the failure to establish as an absolute fact or law is indicated under somewhat different conditions. _Empirical_, from Greek _έv_, on, in, and π͡_ειρα_, trial, experience, refers to knowledge gained simply from observation and experience, not based on any thorough study of cause and effect or even on scientific experiment. _Experimental_, on the other hand, coming from Latin _experiri_, to make a thorough trial of, means the process of discovering laws or facts through systematized observation; _experimental_ simply suggests an incomplete process of discovery. _Hypothetical_, from Greek _ύπό_, under, and _θέσις_, a placing; it is the adjective corresponding to _hypothesis._ A _hypothesis_ is a formulation of a possible law which has not yet been fully demonstrated by experience. That winch is _experimental_ may be as yet unformulated; that which is _hypothetical_ may be formulated, but not yet proved by _experiment. Provisional_ from _pro_, forward, and _videre_, to see, means taken as truth or right until a better way can be discovered; it is a formulation of a principle or method of action with the distinct expectation that it will be superseded; and is intended to serve as a means to an end. _Tentative_, from Latin _tentare_, to try, also means experimental, but it refers to informal rather than formal and systematic experiment, and partly suggests the meaning of _provisional._ That which is _tentative_ is tried as an experiment till something better can be discovered. 

####employ 
**EMPLOY, USE.**  
_Employ_, from the Latin _in_, in, and _plicare_, to fold, signifies to implicate or apply for any special purpose. _Use_, from the Latin _usus_, past participai of _utor_, signifies to enjoy or derive benefit from.  
_Employ_ expresses less than _use;_ it is" in fact a species of partial _using:_ we always _employ_ when we _use;_ but we do not always _use_ when we _employ._ We _employ_ whatever we take into our service or make subservient to our convenience for a time; we _use_ whatever we entirely devote to our purpose. Whatever is _employed_ by one person may, in its turn, be _employed_ by another, or at different times be _employed_ by the same person; but what is _used_ is frequently consumed or rendered unfit for a similar _use._ What we _employ_ may frequently belong to another; but what one _uses_ is supposed to be his exclusive property. On this ground we may speak of _employing_ persons as well as things: but we speak of _using_ things only, and not persons, except in the most degrading sense. Persons, time, strength, and power are _employed;_ houses, furniture, and all materials, of which either necessities or conveniences are composed, are _used._ It is a part of wisdom to _employ_ well the short portion of time which is allotted to us in this sublunary state, and to _use_ the things of this world so as not to abuse them. No one is exculpated from the guilt of an immoral action by suffering himself to be _employed_ as an instrument to serve the purposes of another: we ought to _use_ our utmost endeavors to abstain from all connections with such as wish to implicate us in their guilty practices.

####empty 
**EMPTY, VACANT, VOID, DEVOID.**  
_Empty_ is in Anglo-Saxon _œmta, œmetta_, meaning leisure. _Void_ and _devoid_ come from Old French _voide_, of unknown origin, meaning empty.  
_Empty_ is the term in most general use; _vacant, void_, and _devoid_ are employed in particular cases; _empty_ and _vacant_ have either a proper or an improper application; _void_ or _devoid_ only a moral acceptation. _Empty_, in the natural sense, marks an absence of that which is substantial, or adapted for filling: _vacant_ designates or marks the absence of that which should occupy or make use of a thing. That which is hollow may be _empty:_ that which respects an even space may be _vacant._ A house is _empty_ which has no inhabitants; a seat is _vacant_ which is without an occupant; a room is _empty_ which is without furniture; a space on paper is _vacant_ which is free from writing.  
In their figurative application _empty_ and _vacant_ have a similar analogy: the _empty_ is opposed to that which is substantial: the _vacant_ to that which is or ought to be occupied; a dream is said to be _empty_, or a title _empty;_ a stare is said to be _vacant_, or an hour _vacant. Void_ and _devoid_ are used in the same sense as _vacant_, as qualifying epithets, but not prefixed as adjectives, and ways followed by some object; thus we speak of a creature as _void_ of reason, and of an individual as _devoid_ of common sense.

####encomium 
**ENCOMIUM, EULOGY, PANEGYRIC.**  
_Encomium_ comes from Greek _έv_, in, and _κώρος_, revelry, and signifies a set form of verses used on festive occasions for the purposes of praise. _Eulogy_, in Greek _εύλογία_, from _εύ_ and λόγος, signifies, literally, speaking well of any one. _Panegyric_, in Greek _πανηγυρικόν_, from _πάν_, the whole, and _άγορά_, an assembly, signifies that which is spoken before an assembly, a solemn oration.  
The idea of praise is common to all these terms; but the first seems more properly applied to the thing, or the unconscious object; the second to persons in general, their characters and actions; the third to the person of some particular individual: thus we bestow _encomiums_ upon any work of art or production of genius, without reference to the performer; we bestow _eulogies_ on the exploits of a hero, who is of another age or country; but we write _panegyrics_ either in a direct address or in direct reference to the person who is _panegyrized:_ the _encomium_ is produced by merit, real or supposed; the _eulogy_ may spring from admiration of the person _eulogized;_ the _panegyric_ may be mere flattery, resulting from servile dependence: great _encomiums_ have been paid by all persons to the constitution of England; our naval and military heroes have received the _eulogies_ of many besides their own countrymen; authors of no mean reputation have condescended to deal out their _panegyrics_ pretty freely, in dedications to their patrons.

####encourage 
**ENCOURAGE, ANIMATE, INCITE, IMPEL, URGE, STIMULATE, INVESTIGATE.**  
_Encourage_ (see [cheer](entry://cheer)). _Animate_ (see [animate](entry://animate)). _Incite_, from the Latin _citare_, to stir up, signifies to put into motion toward an object. _Impel_ (see [actuate](entry://actuate)). _Urge_ comes from Latin _urgere_, to drive. _Stimulate_, from the Latin _stimulus_, a spur or goad, and _instigate_, from the Latin _stigo_, signify literally to goad. The idea of actuating or calling into action is common to these terms, which vary in the circumstances of the action.  
_Encouragement_ acts as a persuasive: _animate_, as an _impelling_ or enlivening cause: those who are weak require to be _encouraged;_ those who are strong become stronger by being _animated:_ the former require to have their difficulties removed, their powers renovated, their doubts and fears dispelled; the latter may have their hopes increased, their prospects brightened, and their powers invigorated; we are _encouraged_ not to give up or slacken in our exertions; we are _animated_ to increase our efforts: the sinner is _encouraged_ by offers of pardon, through the merits of a Redeemer, to turn from his sinful ways; the Christian is _animated_ by the prospect of a blissful eternity, to go on from perfection to perfection.  
What _encourages_ and _animates_ acts by the finer feelings of our nature; what _incites_ acts through the medium of our desires: we are _encouraged_ by kindness; we are _animated_ by the hope of reward: we are _incited_ by the desire of distinction.  
What _impels, urges, stimulates_, and _instigates_ acts forcibly, be the cause internal or external: we are _impelled_ and _stimulated_ mostly by what is internal; we are _urged_ and _instigated_ by both the internal and the external, but _particularly_ the latter: we are _impelled_ by motives; we are _stimulated_ by appetites and passions; we are _urged_ and _instigated_ by the representations of others: a benevolent man is _impelled_ by motives of humanity to relieve the wretched; an ardent mind is _stimulated_ by ambition to great efforts; we are _urged_ by entreaties to spare those who are in our power; one is _instigated_ by malicious representations to take revenge on a supposed enemy.  
We may be _impelled_ and _urged_, though not properly _stimulated_ or _instigated_, by circumstances; in this case the former two differ only in the degree of force in the _impelling_ cause: less constraint is laid on the will when we are _impelled_ than when we are _urged_, which leaves no alternative or choice: a monarch is sometimes _impelled_ by the state of the nation to make a peace less advantageous than he would otherwise do; he is _urged_ by his desperate condition to throw himself upon the mercy of the enemy: a man is _impelled_ by the mere necessity of choosing to take one road in preference to another; he is _urged_ by his pecuniary embarrassments to raise money at a great loss.  
We may be _impelled, urged_, and _stimulated_ to that which is bad; we are never _instigated_ to that which is good; we may be _impelled_ by curiosity to pry into that which does not concern us; we may be _urged_ by the entreaties of those we are connected with to take steps of which we afterward repent; we may be _stimulated_ by a desire of revenge to many foul deeds; but those who are not hardened in vice require the _instigation_ of persons more abandoned than themselves before they will commit any desperate act of wickedness.  
_Encouragement_ and _incitement_ are the abstract nouns either for the act of _encouraging_ or _inciting_, or the thing that _encourages_ or _incites:_ the _encouragement_ of laudable undertakings is itself laudable; a single word or look may be an _encouragement:_ the _incitement_ of passion is at all times dangerous, but particularly in youth; money is said to be an _incitement_ to evil. _Incentive_, which is another derivative from _incite_, has a higher application for things that _incite_ than the word _incitement;_ the latter being mostly applied to sensible, and the former to spiritual objects: savory food is an _incitement_ to sensualists to indulge in gross acts of intemperance: a religious man wants no _incentives_ to virtues; his own breast furnishes him with those of the noblest kind. _Impulse_ is the derivative from _impel_, which denotes the act of _impelling; stimulus_, which is the roof of the word _stimulate_, naturally designates the instrument, namely, the spur or goad, with which one is _stimulated:_ hence, we speak of acting by a blind _impulse_, or wanting a _stimulus_ to exertion.  
See also [hearten](entry://hearten)  
**ENCOURAGE, ADVANCE, PROMOTE, PREFER, FORWARD.** — To _encourage_ (see above). _Advance_ (see [advance](entry://advance)). _Promote_, from the Latin _pro_, forward, and _movere_, to move, signifies to move forward. _Prefer_, from the Latin _prœfero_, from _prœ_, before, and _ferre_, to carry, signifies to set up before others. To _forward_ is to put forward.  
The idea of exerting an influence to the advantage of an object is included in the signification of all these terms, which differ in the circumstances and mode of the action: to _encourage, advance_, and _promote_ are applicable to both persons and things; _prefer_, to persons only; _forward_, to things only.  
First as to persons, _encourage_ is partial as to the end, and indefinite as to the means: we may _encourage_ a person in anything, however trivial, and by any means; thus we may _encourage_ a child in his rudeness by not checking him; or we may _encourage_ an artist or man of letters in some great national work; but to _advance, promote_, and _prefer_ are more general in their end and specific in the means; a person may _advance_ himself, or may be _advanced_ by others; he is _promoted_ and _preferred_ only by others: a person's _advancement_ may be the fruit of his industry, or result from the efforts of his friends; _promotion_ and _preferment_ are the work of one's friends; the former in regard to offices in general, the latter mostly in regard to ecclesiastical situations: it is the duty of every one to _encourage_, to the utmost of his power, those among the poor who strive to obtain an honest livelihood; it is every man's duty to _advance_ himself in life by every legitimate means; it is the duty and the pleasure of every good man in the state to _promote_ those who show themselves deserving of _promotion;_ it is the duty of a minister to accept of _preferment_ when it offers, but it is not his duty to be solicitous for it.  
When taken in regard to things, _encourage_ is used in an improper or figurative acceptation; the rest are applied properly: if we _encourage_ an under-talcing, we give courage to the undertaker; but when we speak of _advancing_ a cause, or _promoting_ an interest, or _forwarding_ a purpose, these terms properly convey the idea of keeping things alive or in a motion toward some desired end: to _advance_ is, however, generally used in relation to whatever admits of extension and aggrandizement; _promote_ is applied to whatever admits of being brought to a point of maturity or perfection; _forward_ is but a partial term, employed in the sense of _promote_ in regard to particular objects: thus we _advance_ religion or learning; we _promote_ an art or an invention; we _forward_ a plan.  
**ENCOURAGE, EMBOLDEN.** — To _encourage_ is to give courage, and to _embolden_ to make bold, the former impelling to action in general, the latter to that which is more difficult or dangerous: we are _encouraged_ to persevere; the resolution is thereby confirmed: we are _emboldened_ to begin; the spirit of enterprise is roused. Success _encourages;_ the chance of escaping danger _emboldens._

####encroach 
**ENCROACH, INTRENCH, INTRUDE, INVADE, INFRINGE.**  
_Encroach_ comes through Old French _en crochier_, from French _en_ (Latin _in)_, and Middle Dutch _kroke_, hook (corresponding to English _crook)_, and means literally to hook in. _Intrench_, from Latin _in_ and _trencare_ for _truncare_, to cut, from _truncus_, the trunk of a tree, signifies to cut into another's territory. _Intrude_ comes from Latin _in_, and _trudere_, to thrust, meaning, literally, in the slang phrase, "to butt in. " _Invade_, from _in_, in, and _vadere_, to go, signifies to march in upon. _Infringe_, from the Latin _infringo_, compounded of _in_ and _frangere_, to break, signifies to break in upon.  
All these terms denote an unauthorized procedure; but the first two designate gentle or silent actions, the latter violent if not noisy actions. _Encroach_ is often an imperceptible action, performed with such art as to elude observation; it is, according to its derivation, an insensible creeping into: _intrench_ is, in fact, a species of _encroachment_, namely, that perceptible species which consists in exceeding the boundaries in marking out the ground or space.  
In an extended and figurative application of the terms one is said to _encroach_ on a person or on a person's time, etc.; to _intrench_ on the sphere or privilege of another.  
_Intrude_ and _invade_ designate an unauthorized entry, the former in violation of right, equity, or good manners, the latter in violation of public law: the former is more commonly applied to individuals; the latter to nations or large communities: unbidden guests _intrude_ themselves sometimes into families to their no small annoyance; an army never _invades_ a country without doing some mischief.  
They are figuratively applied to other objects: _intrude_, in the sense of going in without being invited, as unwelcome thoughts _intrude_ themselves into the mind: _invade_, in the sense of going in by force, as sounds _invade_ the ear.  
To _invade_ and _infringe_ are both violent acts; but there is more violation of good faith in _infringing_ than in _invading_, as the _infringement_ of a treaty. A privilege may be either _invaded_ or _infringed;_ but to _invade_ in this sense is applied to any privilege, however obtained; but _infringe_ properly applies to that which persons hold under some grant, compact, or law.

####end 
**END, TERMINATE, CLOSE.**  
To _end_ is either to come to an end or put an end to. To _terminate_, either to come to a term or set a term to. To _close_, to come or bring to a close. To _end_ is indefinite in its meaning and general in its application; _terminate_ and _close_ are modes of _ending:_ to _terminate_ is to end finally; to _close_, to end gradually. Whatever is begun will _end_, and it may _end_ in any way; but what _terminates_ is that which has been designedly brought to an _end;_ a string, a line, a verse, etc., may _end_, but a road is said properly to _terminate._  
Things may _end_ abruptly or at once, but they _close_ by a process or by bringing the parts or points together; a scene may _close_, or several lines may _close._  
Any period of time, as a day, a life, may _end_ or _close._ See also [aim](entry://aim); [sake](entry://sake) **END, EXTREMITY.** — Both these words imply the last of those parts which constitute a thing; but the _end_ designates that part generally; the _extremity_ marks the particular point. The _extremity_ is from the Latin _extremus_, the very last _end_, that which is outermost. Hence _end_ may be said of that which bounds anything, but _extremity_ of that which extends farthest from us: we may speak of the _ends_ of that which is circular in its form, or of that which has no specific form; but we speak of the _extremities_ of that only which is supposed to project lengthwise. The _end_ is opposed to the beginning; the _extremity_ to the centre or point from which we reckon. When a man is said to go to the _end_ of a journey or the _end_ of the world, the expression is in both cases indefinite and general: but when he is said to go to the _extremities_ of the earth or the _extremities_ of a kingdom, the idea of relative distance is manifestly implied. He who goes to the _end_ of a path may possibly have, a little farther to go in order to reach the _extremity._ In the figurative application, _end_ and _extremity_ differ so widely as not to admit of any just comparison. 

####endeavor 
**ENDEAVOR, AIM, STRIVE, STRUGGLE.**  
To _endeavor_ is general in its object, _aim_ is particular; we _endeavor_ to do whatever we set about; we _aim_ at doing something which we have set before ourselves as a desirable object. To _strive_ is to _endeavor_ earnestly; to _struggle_ is to _strive_ earnestly. An _endeavor_ springs from a sense of duty (from French _en devoir_, on duty); we _endeavor_ to do that which is right and avoid that which is wrong: _aiming_ is the fruit of an aspiring temper; the object _aimed_ at is always something superior either in reality or in imagination, and calls for particular exertion: _striving_ is the consequence of an ardent desire; the thing _striven_ for is always conceived to be of importance: _struggling_ is the effect of necessity; it is proportioned to the difficulty of attainment and the resistance which is opposed to it; the thing _struggled_ for is indispensably necessary. Those only who _endeavor_ to discharge their duty to God and their fellow-creatures can expect real tranquillity of mind. Whoever _aims_ at the acquirement of great wealth or much power opens the door for much misery to himself. As our passions are acknowledged to be our greatest enemies when they obtain the ascendency, we should always _strive_ to keep them under our control. There are some men who _struggle_ through life to obtain a mere competence, and yet die without succeeding in their object.  
**ENDEAVOR, EFFORT, EXERTION.** — _Endeavor_ (see [attempt ](entry://attempt )and above). _Effort_ comes from Latin _ex_, out, and _fortis_, strong, and means to bring force to bear upon. _Exertion_ is derived from Latin _ex_, out, and _serere_, to join, or put, meaning to put forth the strength and apply it to something.  
The idea of calling our powers into action is common to these terms; _endeavor_ expresses little more than this common idea, being a term of general import: _effort_ and _exertion_ are particular modes of _endeavor;_ the former being a special strong _endeavor_, the latter a continued strong _endeavor._ An _endeavor_ is called forth by ordinary circumstances; _effort_ and _exertion_, by those which are extraordinary. An _endeavor_ flows out of the condition of our being and constitution; as rational and responsible agents we must make daily _endeavors_ to fit ourselves for a hereafter; as willing and necessitous agents we use our _endeavors_ to obtain such things AS are agreeable or needful for us: when a particular emergency arises we make a great _effort._ An _endeavor_ may call forth one or many powers; an _effort_ calls forth but one power: the _endeavor_ to please in society is laudable if it do not lead to vicious compliances; it is a laudable _effort_ of fortitude to suppress our complaints in the moment of suffering.  
The _exertion_ is as indefinite as the _endeavor_ is to the means, but, like the _effort_, is definite as to the object: when a serious object is to be obtained, suitable _exertions_ must be made. The _endeavor_ is mostly applied to individuals, but the _exertion_ may frequently be the combined _endeavors_ of numbers.

####enemy 
**ENEMY, FOE, ADVERSARY, OPPONENT, ANTAGONIST.**  
_Enemy_, in Latin _inimicus_, compound of _in_, privative, and _amicus_, a friend, signifies one that is unfriendly. _Foe_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _fah_, hostile. _Adversary_, in Latin _adversarius_ from _adversus_, against, signifies one that takes part against another; _adversarius_ in Latin was particularly applied to those who contested a point in law with another. _Opponent_, in Latin _opponens_, participle of _opponere_, from _ob_, in the way of, and _ponere_, to place, signifies one pitted against another. _Antagonist_, in Greek ά_νταγωνιστής_, compounded of _άντί, a_gainst, and _άγωνίζομαι_, I struggle, signifies one struggling against another.  
An _enemy_ is not so formidable as a _foe;_ the former may be reconciled, but the latter always retains a deadly hate. An _enemy_ may be so in spirit, in action, or in relation; a _foe_ is always so in spirit, if not in action likewise: a man may be an _enemy_ to himself, though not a _foe._ Those who are national or political _enemies_ are often private friends, but a _foe_ is never anything but a _foe._ A single act may create an _enemy_, but continued warfare creates a _foe. Enemies_ are either public or private, collective or personal; in the latter sense the word _enemy_ is most analogous in signification to that of _adversary, opponent, antagonist._ The term _enemy_ is always taken in a larger sense than the other terms: a private _enemy_ is never inactive; he seeks to do mischief from the desire of so doing. An _adversary, opponent_, and _antagonist_ may be so simply from the relation which they stand in to others: the _adversary_ is one who is adverse either in his claims, his opinions, his purposes, or his endeavors; he is active against others only as far as his interests and views require. An _opponent_ is one who stands or acts in opposition to another: an _opponent_ opposes the opinions, principles, conduct, and writings of others. An _adversary_ is always personal, and sets himself up immediately against another; but an _opponent_ has nothing to do with the person, but with the thing that emanates from or is connected with the person. A man can have no _adversaries_ except while he is living, but he may have _opponents_ after he is dead; partisans are always _opponents_ to each other. An _antagonist_ is a particular species of _opponent_ either in combat or in action; it is personal or otherwise, according to circumstances: there may be _antagonists_ who contend for victory without any feeling of animosity; such were the Horatii and Curiatii among the Romans: or they may engage in a personal and bloody conflict, as the gladiators who fought for their lives: in this sense wild beasts are _antagonists_ when they engage in battle; there are also literary _antagonists_ who are directly pitted against each other: as Scaliger and Petavius among the French; Boyle and Bentley among the English.  
_Enemy_ and _foe_ are figuratively applied to moral objects, the first in a general, the second in a particular sense: our passions are our _enemies_ when indulged: envy is a _foe_ to happiness. The word _antagonist_ may also be applied metaphorically to other objects. 

####energy 
**ENERGY, FORCE, VIGOR.**  
_Energy_ comes from Greek _ένέργεια_, from Greek _έv_, in, and _έργον_, work, meaning work put into something. _Force_ (see [compel](entry://compel)). _Vigor_, from the Latin _vigere_, to flourish, signifies unimpaired power, or that which belongs to a subject in a sound or flourishing state.  
With _energy_ is connected the idea of activity; with _force_, that of capability; with _vigor_, that of health. _Energy_ lies only in the mind; _force_ and _vigor_ are the property of either body or mind. Knowledge and freedom combine to produce _energy_ of character; _force_ is a gift of nature that may be increased by exercise: _vigor_, both bodily and mental, is an ordinary accompaniment of youth, but is not always denied to old age.

####enigma 
**ENIGMA, PARADOX, RIDDLE.**  
All these words indicate something puzzling, hard to understand or solve, but the character of the implied intellectual difficulty varies. _Enigma_ comes from Greek _α̋ινιγμα_, meaning an obscure speech, and referred to a short composition in prose or verse in which something was described by intentionally obscure metaphors, in order to afford an exercise for the ingenuity of the reader in guessing what was meant. _Riddle_, Anglo-Saxon _rœdels_, is the native English term for exactly the same sort of thing. A _paradox_, from Greek _παρά_, contrary to, and _δόξα_, opinion, is a statement contrary to received opinion, a statement which on the face of it seems self-contradictory, absurd, or at variance with common sense, though it may be essentially true. An _enigma_, therefore, is not a _paradox_, but a _paradox_, not being intelligible, may seem like an _enigma._ Between _enigma_ and _riddle_ there is no essential difference. _Enigma_, being the Greek term and the learned word, less clearly suggests its exact character to the popular mind than the familiar native term _riddle._ Accordingly it is at once more vague and more dignified. _Paradox_ has an essentially different meaning from _enigma_ and _riddle_, but it is included because it shares with them the general implication of obscurity — something puzzling to the mind, difficult to solve. 

####enjoyment 
**ENJOYMENT, FRUITION, GRATIFICATION.**  
_Enjoyment_, from _enjoy_, to have the joy or pleasure, signifies either the act of _enjoying_ or the pleasure itself derived from that act. _Fruition_, from _frui_, to _enjoy_, is employed only for the act of _enjoying;_ we speak either of the _enjoyment_ of any pleasure or of the _enjoyment_ as a pleasure: we speak of those pleasures which are received from the _fruition_, in distinction from those which are had in expectation. _Enjoyment_ is either corporeal or spiritual, as the _enjoyment_ of music or the _enjoyment_ of study: but the _fruition_ of eating or any other sensible, or at least external, object: hope intervenes between the desire and the _fruition. Gratification_, from the verb to _gratify_, to make grateful or pleasant, signifies either the act of giving pleasure or the pleasure received. _Enjoyment_ springs from every object which is capable of yielding pleasure; by distinction, however, and in the latter sense, from moral and rational objects: but _gratification_, which is a species of _enjoyment_, is obtained through the medium of the senses. _Enjoyment_ is not so vivid as _gratification: gratification_ is not so permanent as _enjoyment._ Domestic fife has its peculiar _enjoyments;_ brilliant spectacles afford _gratification._ Our capacity for _enjoyment_ depends upon our intellectual endowments; our _gratification_ depends upon the tone of our feelings and the nature of our desires. 

####enlarge 
**ENLARGE, INCREASE, EXTEND.**  
_Enlarge_ signifies literally to make large or wide, and is applied to dimension and extent. _Increase_, from the Latin _increscere_, from _in_, in, and _crescere_, to grow, means to grow from within, and is applicable to quantity, signifying to become greater in size by natural development. _Extend_, in Latin _extendo_, or _ex_, out, and _tendere_, to stretch, signifies to stretch out, that is, to make greater in space. We speak of _enlarging_ a house, a room, premises, or boundaries; of _increasing_ an army or property, capital, expense, etc.; of _extending_ the boundaries of an empire. We say the hole or cavity _enlarges_, the head or bulk _enlarges;_ the number _increases_, the swelling, inflammation, and the like _increase:_ so likewise in the figurative sense, the views, the prospects, the powers, the ideas, and the mind are _enlarged;_ pain, pleasure, hope, fear, anger, or kindness is _increased;_ views, prospects, connections, and the like are _extended._

####enmity 
**ENMITY, ANIMOSITY, HOSTILITY.**  
_Enmity_ lies in the heart; it is deep and malignant. _Animosity_, from _animus_, a spirit, lies in the passions; it is fierce and vindictive: _hostility_, from _hostis_, a political enemy, lies in the action; it is mischievous and destructive.  
_Enmity_ is something permanent; _animosity_ is partial and transitory: in the feudal ages, when the darkness and ignorance of the times prevented the mild influence of Christianity, _enmities_ between particular families were handed down as an inheritance from father to son; in free states party spirit engenders greater _animosities_ than private disputes.  
_Enmity_ is altogether personal; _hostility_ respects public or private measures. _Enmity_ often lies concealed in the heart and does not betray itself by any open act of _hostility._  
See also **hatred** under [hate](entry://hate)

####enormous 
**ENORMOUS, HUGE, IMMENSE, VAST.**  
_Enormous_, from _e_ and _norma_, a rule, signifies out of rule or order. _Huge_ comes from Anglo-French _ahoge_, the origin of which is unknown. _Immense_, in Latin _immensus_, compounded of _in_, privative, and _mensus_, measured, signifies not to be measured. _Vast_, in French _vaste_, Latin _vastus_, waste, signifies characteristic of a great open space, of a _waste_ or wilderness.  
_Enormous_ and _huge_ are peculiarly applicable to magnitude; _immense_ and _vast_ to extent, quantity, and number. _Enormous_ expresses more than _huge_, as _immense_ expresses more than _vast:_ what is _enormous_ exceeds in a very great degree all ordinary bounds; what is _huge_ is great only in the superlative degree. The _enormous_ is always out of proportion; the _huge_ is relatively extraordinary in its dimensions. Some animals may be made _enormously_ fat by a particular mode of feeding: to one who has seen nothing but level ground common hills will appear to be _huge_ mountains. The _immense_ is that which exceeds all calculation: the _vast_ comprehends only a very great or unusual excess. The distance between the earth and sun may be said to be _immense:_ the distance between the poles is _vast._  
Of all these terms _huge_ is the only one confined to the proper application and in the proper sense of size: the rest are employed with regard to moral objects. We speak only of a _huge_ animal, a _huge_ monster, a _huge_ mass, a _huge_ size, a _huge_ bulk, and the like; but we speak of an _enormous_ waste, an _immense_ difference, and a _vast_ number.  
**ENORMOUS, PRODIGIOUS, MONSTROUS.** — _Enormous_ (see above). _Prodigious_ comes from _prodigy_, in Latin _prodigium_, signifying, literally, breaking out in excess or extravagance. _Monstrous_, from _monster_, in Latin _monstrum_, and _monstro_, show or make visible, signifies remarkable, or exciting notice.  
The _enormous_ contradicts our rules of estimating and calculating; the _prodigious_ raises our minds beyond their ordinary standard of thinking: the _monstrous_ contradicts nature and the course of things. What is _enormous_ excites our surprise or amazement: what is _prodigious_ excites our astonishment: what is _monstrous_ does violence to our senses and understanding. There is something _enormous_ in the present scale upon which property, whether public or private, is amassed and expended: the works of the ancients in general, but the Egyptian pyramids in particular, are objects of admiration, on account of the _prodigious_ labor which was bestowed on them: ignorance and superstition have always been active in producing _monstrous_ images for the worship of its blind votaries. 

####enough 
**ENOUGH, SUFFICIENT.**  
_Enough_, Anglo-Saxon _genoh_, German _genug_, probably comes from a root signifying to attain to. _Sufficient_, in Latin _sufficiens_, participle of _sufficio_, compounded of _sub_ and _facere_, to make, signifies made or suited to the purpose.  
He has _enough_ whose desires are satisfied; he has _sufficient_ whose wants are supplied. We may therefore frequently have _sufficiency_ when we have not _enough._ A greedy man is commonly in this case, who has never _enough_, although he has more than a _sufficiency. Enough_ is said only of physical objects of desire: _sufficient_ is employed in a moral application for that which serves the purpose. Children and animals never have _enough_ food, nor the miser _enough_ money: it is requisite to allow _sufficient_ time for everything that is to be done, if we wish it to be done well. 

####enrapture 
See [charm](entry://charm)

####enroll 
**ENROLL, ENLIST or LIST, REGISTER, RECORD.**  
_Enroll_, compounded of French _en_, Latin _in_, and _role_, from _rotula_, a little wheel, signifies to place in a roll, that is, in a roll of paper or a book. _Enlist_ is compounded of French _en_ and _liste_ from Old High German _lista_, a border or strip, signifying a long strip of paper on which names were written; the verb meaning to put on a _list. Register_ comes from Latin _re_, back, and _gestum_, past participle of _gerere_, to carry, and means a thing carried back, a memorandum brought back; the verb means to write the memorandum. _Record_, in Latin _recorder_, compounded of re, back or again, and _cors_, the heart, signifies to bring back to the heart or call to mind by a memorandum.  
_Enroll_ and _enlist_ respect persons only; _register_ respects persons and things; _record_ respects things only. _Enroll_ is generally applied to the act of inserting names in an orderly manner into any book; _enlist_ is a species of _enrolling_ applicable only to the military. The _enrolment_ is an act of authority; the _enlisting_ is the voluntary act of an individual. Among the Romans it was the office of the censor to _enroll_ the names of all the citizens, in order to ascertain their number and estimate their property: in modern times soldiers are mostly raised by means of _enlisting._  
In the moral application of the terms, to _enroll_ is to assign a certain place or rank; to _enlist_ is to put one's self under a leader or attach one's self to a party. Hercules was _enrolled_ among the gods; the common people are always ready to _enlist_ on the side of anarchy and rebellion.  
To _enroll_ and _register_ both imply writing down in a book; but the former is a less formal act than the latter. The insertion of the bare name or designation in a certain order is enough to constitute an _enrolment;_ but _registering_ comprehends the birth, family, and other collateral circumstances of the individual. The object of _registering_ likewise differs from that of _enrolling:_ what is _registered_ serves for future purposes and is of permanent utility to society in general; but what is _enrolled_ often serves only a particular or temporary end. Thus in numbering the people it is necessary simply to _enroll_ their names; but when in addition to this it was necessary, as among the Romans, to ascertain their rank in the state, everything connected with their property, their family, and their connection required to be _registered;_ so in like manner, in more modern times, it has been found necessary for the good government of the state to _register_ the births, marriages, and deaths of every citizen: it is manifest, therefore, that what is _registered_, as far as respects persons, may be said to be _enrolled;_ but what is _enrolled_ is not always _registered._ Persons only, or things personal, are _enrolled_, and that properly for public purposes only; but things as well as persons are _registered_ for private as well as public purposes.  
To _register_ in its proper sense is to place in writing; to _record_ is to make a memorial of anything, either by writing, printing, engraving, or otherwise: _registering_ is for some specific and immediate purpose; as to _register_ decrees or other proceedings in a court: _recording_ is for general and oftentimes remote purposes: to _record_ events in history.  
In an extended and figurative application, things may be said to be _registered_ in the memory; or events _recorded_ in history. We have a right to believe that the actions of good men are _registered_ in heaven; the particular sayings and actions of princes are _recorded_ in history, and handed down to the latest posterity.

####enslave 
**ENSLAVE, CAPTIVATE.**  
To _enslave_ is to bring into a state of _slavery._ To _captivate_ is to make a _captive._  
There is as much difference between these terms as between _slavery_ and _captivity:_ he who is a _slave_ is fettered both body and mind; he who is a _captive_ is only constrained as to his body: hence to _enslave_ is always taken in the bad sense; _captivate_, in a good or bad sense: _enslave_ is employed literally or figuratively; _captivate_ only figuratively: we may be _enslaved_ by persons or by our gross passions; we are _captivated_ by the charms or beauty of an object.

####enterprising 
**ENTERPRISING, ADVENTUROUS.**  
These terms mark a disposition to engage in that which is extraordinary and hazardous; but _enterprising_, from _enterprise_ (see [attempt](entry://attempt)), is connected with the understanding; and _adventurous_, from _adventure_ (from Latin _ad_, to, and _venire_, to come, meaning a coming to, an attempt or trial), is a characteristic of the passions. The _enterprising_ character conceives great projects, and pursues objects that are difficult to be obtained; the _adventurous_ character is contented with seeking that which is new and placing himself in dangerous and unusual situations. An _enterprising_ spirit belongs to the commander of an army or the ruler of a nation; an _adventurous_ disposition is suitable to men of low degree. Peter the Great possessed, in a peculiar manner, an _enterprising_ genius; Robinson Crusoe was a man of an _adventurous_ turn. _Enterprising_ characterizes persons only, but _adventurous_ is also applied to tilings, to signify containing _adventures;_ hence a journey, or a voyage, or a history may be denominated _adventurous._

####enthusiast 
**ENTHUSIAST, FANATIC, VISIONARY, DEVOTEE.**  
The_ enthusiast, fanatic_, and _visionary_ have disordered imaginations; but the _enthusiast_ is only affected inwardly with an extraordinary fervor, the _fanatic_ and _visionary_ betray that fervor by some outward mark; the former by singularities of conduct, the latter by singularities of doctrine. _Fanatics_ and _visionaries_ are therefore always more or less _enthusiasts;_ but _enthusiasts_ are not always _fanatics_ or _visionaries. 'Ένθουσιάσταί_, among the Greeks, from _εν_, in, and _θεός_, God, signified those supposed to have, or pretending to have, divine inspiration. _Fanatici_ were so called among the Latins from _fana_ (temples), in which they spent an extraordinary portion of their time; they, like the _ένθονσιάσται_ of the Greeks, pretended to revelations and inspirations, during the influence of which they indulged themselves in many extravagant tricks, cutting themselves with knives, and distorting themselves with every species of antic, gesture, and grimace.  
In the modern acceptation of these terms the _fanatic_ is one who fancies himself inspired, and, rejecting the use of his understanding, falls into every kind of extravagance; it is mostly applied to a man's religious conduct and belief, but may be applied to any extravagant conduct founded on false principles.  
An _enthusiast_ is one who is under the influence of any particular fervor of mind, more especially where it is a religious fervor.  
There may be _enthusiasm_ in other matters, where it is less mischievous. There may be _enthusiasts_ in the cause of humanity, or in the love of one's country, or in any other matter in which the affections may be called into exercise.  
The _visionary_ is properly one that sees or professes to see visions, and is mostly applied to those who pretend to supernatural visions, but it may be employed in respect to any one who indulges in fantastical theories. A _devotee_ is one who is extravagantly and, it may be, superstitiously devoted to a cause. The word expresses exaggerated interest, and, so far, is synonymous with the other terms, but it does not suggest disordered imagination, as does _fanatic._

####epithet 
**EPITHET, ADJECTIVE.**  
_Epithet_ is the technical term of the rhetorician; _adjective_ that of the grammarian. The same word is an _epithet_ as it qualifies the sense; it is an _adjective_ as it is a part of speech: thus, in the phrase "Alexander the Great, " great is an epithet, inasmuch as it designates Alexander in distinction from all other persons: it is an _adjective_ as it expresses a quality in distinction from the noun Alexander, which denotes a thing.  
The _epithet (έπίθητον_, from _έπί_, beside, and _τίθημι_, I place) is the word added by way of ornament to the diction; the _adjective_, from _adjectivum_, is the word added to the noun as its appendage, and made subservient to it in all its inflections. When we are estimating the merits of any one's style or composition, we should speak of the _epithets_ he uses; when we are talking of words, their dependencies and relations, we should speak of _adjectives:_ an _epithet_ is either gentle or harsh, an _adjective_ is either a noun or a pronoun _adjective._ All _adjectives_ are _epithets_, but all _epithets_ are not _adjectives;_ thus, in Virgil's Pater Æneas, the _pater_ is an _epithet_, but not an _adjective._

####equal 
**EQUAL, EVEN, EQUABLE, LIKE or ALIKE, UNIFORM.**  
_Equal_, in Latin _œqualis_, comes from _œquus. Even_ is in Anglo-Saxon _efen. Equable_, in Latin _equabilis_, signifies susceptible of _equality. Like_, Anglo-Saxon _lic_, comes from a Teutonic base meaning resembling in form. _Uniform_, compounded of _unus_, one, and _forma_, form, bespeaks its own meaning.  
All these _epithets_ are opposed to difference. _Equal_ is said of degree, quantity, number, and dimensions, as _equal_ in years; of an _equal_ age; an _equal_ height: _even_ is said of the surface and position of bodies; a board is made _even_ with another board; the floor or the ground is _even: like_ is said of accidental qualities in tilings, as _alike_ in color or in feature: _uniform_ is said of things only as to their fitness to correspond; those which are _unlike_ in color, shape, or make are not _uniform_, and cannot be made to match as pairs: _equable_ is used only in the moral acceptation, in which all the others are likewise employed.  
As moral qualities admit of degree, they admit of _equality:_ justice is dealt out in _equal_ portions to the rich and the poor; God looks with an _equal_ eye on all mankind. As the natural path is rendered uneven by high and low ground, so the _evenness_ of the temper, in the figurative sense, is destroyed by changes of humor, by elevations and depressions of the spirits; and the _equability_ of life, from prosperous to adverse. _Even_ and _equable_ are applied to the same object in regard to itself, as an _even_ path or _equable_ course; _like_ or _alike_ is applied to two or more objects in regard to one another, as two persons are _alike_ in disposition, taste, opinions, etc.; _uniform_ is said, either of one object in regard to itself, as to be _uniform_ in conduct, or of many objects in regard to one another, as modes are _uniform._

####eradicate 
**ERADICATE, EXTIRPATE, EXTERMINATE.**  
To _eradicate_, from _radix_, the root, is to get out by the root: _extirpate_, from _ex_ and _stirps_, the stem, is to get out the stock, to destroy it thoroughly. In the natural sense we may _eradicate_ noxious weeds whenever we pull them from the ground; but we can never _extirpate_ all noxious weeds, as they always disseminate their seeds and spring up afresh. These words are seldomer used in the physical than in the moral sense; where the former is applied to such objects as are conceived to be plucked up by the roots, as habits, vices, abuses, evils; and the latter to whatever is united or supposed to be united into a race or family, and is destroyed root and branch. Youth is the season when vicious habits may be thoroughly _eradicated;_ by the universal deluge the whole human race was _extirpated_ with the exception of Noah and his family.  
_Exterminate_, in Latin _exterminatus_, participle of _extermine_, from _ex_ or _extra_ and _terminus_, boundary, signifies to expel beyond the boundary (of life), that is, out of existence. It is used only in regard to such things as have life, and designates a violent and immediate action: _extirpate_, on the other hand, may designate a progressive action: the former may be said of individuals, but the latter is employed in the collective sense only. Plague, pestilence, famine, _extirpate:_ the sword _exterminates._

####erratic 
**ERRATIC, ECCENTRIC.**  
_Erratic_ comes from French _erratique_, Latin _erraticus_, prone to wander, from _errare_, to wander. _Eccentric_ comes through French from Greek _έκ_, out, and _κέντρον_, circle, meaning not _concentric_ with another circle, or, in astronomy, moving in an orbit deviating more or less from a center. These words have similar meanings. Both were astronomical terms; both indicate motion deviating from a fixed course; and both have been employed, in a figurative sense, to indicate that which does not correspond to a set standard. _Erratic_, however, refers to a more active departure from a fixed course than does _eccentric._ The _eccentric_ person does not do as others do; the _erratic_ person fails to do as others do, but acts in a particularly irregular and jerky and unsystematic fashion. 

####error 
**ERROR, MISTAKE, BLUNDER.**  
_Error_, in French _erreur_, Latin _error_, from _errare_, to wander, marks the act of wandering, as applied to the rational faculty. A _mistake_ is a taking amiss or wrong, and is derived from the Scandinavian. _Blunder_ is a Scandinavian word formed as a frequentative from Icelandic _blunda_, to doze or slumber, allied to _blind. Error_ in its universal sense is the general term, since every deviation from what is right in rational agents is termed _error_, which is strictly opposed to truth; _error_ is the lot of humanity; into whatever we attempt to do or think _error_ will be sure to creep: the term, therefore, is of unlimited use; the very mention -of it reminds us of our condition: we have _errors_ of judgment, _errors_ of calculation, _errors_ of the head, and _errors_ of the heart. The other terms designate _modes_ of _error_, which mostly refer to the common concerns of life: _mistake_ is an _error_ of choice; _blunder_ an _error_ of action: children and careless people are most apt to make _mistakes;_ ignorant, conceited, and stupid people commonly commit _blunders:_ a _mistake_ must be rectified; in commercial transactions it may be of serious consequence: a _blunder_ must be set right; but _blunderers_ are not always to be set right; and _blunders_ are frequently so ridiculous as only to excite laughter.

_Error, Faults_ — _Error_ respects the act; _fault_, from Latin _fallere_, to deceive, English _fail_, respects the agent: an _error_ may he in the judgment or in the conduct; but a _fault_ lies in the will or intention: the _errors_ of youth must be treated with indulgence; but their _faults_ must on all accounts be corrected: _error_ is said of that which is individual and partial; _fault_ is said likewise of that which is habitual: it is an _error_ to use intemperate language at any time; it is a _fault_ in the temper of some persons that they cannot restrain their anger.

####eruption 
**ERUPTION, EXPLOSION.**  
_Eruption_, from _e_, out, and _rumpere_, to break, signifies the breaking forth, that is, the coming into view, by a sudden bursting; _explosion_, from _ex_, out, and _plaudere_, to clap, meant to drive off the stage by clapping; and now signifies bursting out with a noise: hence of flames there will be properly an _eruption_, but of gunpowder an _explosion:_ volcanoes have then _eruptions_ at certain intervals, which are sometimes attended with _explosions:_ on this account _eruptions_ are applied to the human body for whatever comes out as the effects of humor, and may be applied in the same manner to any indications of humor in the mind; _explosions_ are also applied to the agitations of the mind which burst out. 

####escape 
**ESCAPE, ELUDE, EVADE.**  
_Escape_ means literally to slip out from under one's cape, from French _es_, out, Latin _ex_, and _cappa_, cape. _Elude_ (see [avoid](entry://avoid)). _Evade_, from the Latin _evado_, compounded of _e_, out, and _vadere_, to go, signifies to go or get out of a thing.  
The idea of being disengaged from that which is not agreeable is comprehended in the sense of all these terms; but _escape_ designates no means by which this is effected; _elude_ and _evade_ define the means, namely, the efforts which are used by one's self: we are simply disengaged when we _escape,_ but we disengage ourselves when we _elude_ and _evade:_ we _escape_ from danger; we _elude_ search: our _escapes_ are often providential and often narrow; our success in _eluding_ depends on our skill: there are many bad men who _escape_ punishment by the mistake of a word; there are many who _escape_ detection by the art with which they _elude_ observation and inquiry.  
_Elude_ and _evade_ both imply the practice of art on trying occasions; but the former is employed to denote a more ready and dexterous exercise of art than the latter; the former consists mostly of that which is done by a trick, the latter consists of words as well as actions: a thief _eludes_ those who are in pursuit of him by dexterous modes of concealment; he _evades_ the interrogatories of the judge by equivocating replies. One is said to _elude_ a punishment and to _evade_ a law.

####especially 
**ESPECIALLY, PARTICULARLY, PRINCIPALLY, CHIEFLY.**  
_Especially_ and _particularly_ are exclusive or superlative in their import; they refer to one object out of many that is superior to all; _principally_ and _chiefly_ are comparative in their import; they designate in general the superiority of some objects over others. _Especially_ is a term of stronger import than _particularly_, and _principally_ expresses something less general than _chiefly:_ we ought to have God before our eyes at all times, but _especially_ in those moments when we present ourselves before Him in prayer: the heat is very oppressive in all countries under the torrid zone, but _particularly_ in the deserts of Arabia, where there is a want of shade and moisture: it is _principally_ among the higher and lower orders of society that we find vices of every description to be prevalent; robberies happen _chiefly_ by night. 

####espouse 
**ESPOUSE, BETROTH.**  
_Espouse_, in old French _espouser_, modern French _épouser_, a spouse or wife, from the Latin _sponso_, to betroth, that from _spondere_, to promise, old Spanish _esposar_, Italian _sposare_, has two very different significations. In the present and more common one the term implies to promise, or engage in marriage, usually by a written contract, sometimes by word of mouth with or without witnesses, and _espousal_ implies the act of contracting a man and woman to each other in marriage.  
_Betroth_, a compound of the English _be_ and the Old English _troth_, truth, signifies the act of plighting or pledging one's _troth_, a token of faith, truth, or earnest intention: in this application a pledge or agreement of marriage. To _espouse_ is to wed; to _betroth_ is to give a pledge that the man and woman will wed. A father or _sponsor_ gives a woman to a man to be his _spouse_, or wife, and a bridegroom takes the woman as his _spouse. Espouse_ is also used figuratively, meaning to make one's own entirely, as in the phrase to _espouse_ a cause.

####essay 
**ESSAY, TREATISE, TRACT, DISSERTATION.**  
All these words are employed by authors to characterize compositions varying in their form and contents. _Essay_, which signifies a trial or attempt, is here used to designate in a specific manner an author's attempt to illustrate any point: it is most commonly applied to small detached pieces, which contain only the general thoughts of a writer on any given subject, and afford room for amplification into details also: though, by Locke, in his _"Essay_ on the Understanding, " Beat-tie, in his _"Essay_ on Truth, " and other authors, it is modestly used for their connected and finished endeavors to elucidate a doctrine. A _treatise_ is more systematic than an _essay;_ it treats on the subject in a methodical form, and conveys the idea of something labored, scientific, and instructive. A _tract_ is only a species of a small _treatise_, drawn up upon particular occasions, and published in a separate form; they are both derived from the Latin _tractus_, participle of _traho_, draw, manage, or handle. _Dissertation_, from Latin _disserere_, compounded of _dis_, apart, and _serere_, to join, means the taking up of a subject part by part, suggesting a thorough and exhaustive analysis.  
_Essays_ are either moral, political, philosophical, or literary: they are the crude attempts of the youth to digest his own thoughts or they are the more mature attempts of the man to communicate his thoughts to others of the former description are the prize _essays_ in schools; and of the latter are the innumerable _essays_ which have been published on every subject since the time of Bacon to the present day: _treatises_ are mostly written on ethical, political, or speculative subjects such as Fenelon's, Milton's, or Locke's _treatise_ on education; De Lolme's _treatise_ on the constitution of England; Colquhoun's _treatise_ on the police: _dissertations_ are employed on disputed points of literature, as Bentley's _dissertation_ upon the epistles of Phalaris; De Pauw's _dissertations_ on the Egyptians and Chinese: _tracts_ are ephemeral productions, mostly on political and religious subjects, which seldom survive the occasion which gave them birth; of this description are the pamphlets which daily issue from the press, for or against the measures of government or the public measures of any particular party.

####estate 
**ESTATE, PROPERTY, RANK.**  
_Estate_, Old French _estat_, from Latin _status_, meant originally condition in general or a good condition, with special reference to worldly prosperity. Out of its original sense it developed several different meanings, characterized in each case, however, by a certain formality and legal stiffness in its application. In one sense _estate_ is a synonyme of _property_, from Latin _proprius_, one's own, meaning that which is one's own. _Property_ is the general and familiar term applied to all that one owns; _estate_ a legal term applied to the interest that any one has in lands, tenements, or other effects. Again _property_ may indicate a piece of land owned by an individual or a corporation; _estate_ that same piece of land if it is sufficiently large and sumptuously developed. We speak of the farmer's _property;_ the rich man's _estate._  
**ESTATE, RANK.** — _Estate_ is also a synonyme of _rank_ (see [class](entry://class)), from which it differs in suggesting not merely a division into _ranks_, but something of its original reference to worldly condition; as well as in being a somewhat more formal and specific word with distinctly French associations. In Great Britain the _estates of the realm_ mean the lords spiritual, the lords temporal, and the commons — the first two being represented in the House of Lords, the last in the House of Commons. 

####esteem 
**ESTEEM, RESPECT, REGARD.**  
_Esteem_ (see [appraise](entry://appraise)). _Respect_, from the Latin _respicere_, signifies to look back upon, to look upon with attention. _Regard_ (see [attend](entry://attend)).  
A favorable sentiment toward particular objects is included in the meaning of all these terms. _Esteem_ and _respect_ flow from the understanding; _regard_ springs from the heart as well as the head: _esteem_ is produced by intrinsic worth; _respect_ by extrinsic qualities; _regard_ is affection blended with _esteem:_ it is in the power of every man, independently of all collateral circumstances, to acquire the _esteem_ of others; but _respect_ and _regard_ are within the reach of a limited number only: the high and the low, the rich and the poor, the equal and the unequal are each, in their turn, the objects of _esteem;_ those only are objects of _respect_ who have some mark of distinction or superiority of either birth, talent, acquirements, or the like; _regard_ subsists only between friends, or those who stand in close connection with one another: industry and sobriety excite our _esteem_ for one man, charity and benevolence our _esteem_ for another; superior learning or abilities excite our _respect_ for another; a long acquaintance or a reciprocity of kind offices excites a mutual _regard._  
See also **value** under [valuable](entry://valuable)

####estimate 
**ESTIMATE, COMPUTE, RATE.**  
_Estimate_ (see [appraise](entry://appraise)). _Compute_ (see [calculate](entry://calculate)). _Rate_, in Latin _ratus_, participle of _reor_, to think, signifies to weigh in the mind.  
All these terms mark the mental operations by which the sum, amount, or value of things is obtained: to _estimate_ is to obtain the aggregate sum in one's mind, either by an immediate or a progressive act; to _compute_ is to obtain the sum by the gradual process of putting together items; to _rate_ is to fix the relative value in one's mind by deduction and comparison; a builder _estimates_ the expense of building a house on a given plan; a proprietor of houses _computes_ the probable diminution in the value of his property in consequence of wear and tear; the surveyor _rates_ the present value of lands or houses.  
In the moral acceptation they bear the same analogy to each other: some men are apt to _estimate_ the adventitious privileges of birth or rank too high; it would be a useful occupation for men to _compute_ the loss they sustain by the idle waste of time, on the one hand, and its necessarily unprofitable consumption, on the other: he who _rates_ his abilities too high is in danger of despising the means which are essential to secure success; and he who _rates_ them too low is apt to neglect the means, from despair of success. 

####estrangement 
See **abstraction** under [abstract](entry://abstract)

####eternal 
**ETERNAL, ENDLESS, EVERLASTING.**  
The _eternal_ is set above time, the _endless_ lies within time; it is therefore by a strong figure that we apply _eternal_ to anything sublunary; although _endless_ may with propriety be applied to that which is heavenly; that is properly _eternal_ which has neither beginning nor end; that is _endless_ which has a beginning but no end: God is, therefore, an _eternal_, but not an _endless_ being: there is an _eternal_ state of happiness or misery which awaits all men, according to their deeds in this life; but their joys or sorrows may be _endless_ as regards the present life. That which is _endless_ has no cessation; that which is _everlasting_ has neither interruption nor cessation: the _endless_ may be said of existing things; the _everlasting_ naturally extends itself into futurity: hence we speak of _endless_ disputes, an _endless_ warfare; an _everlasting_ memorial, an _everlasting_ crown of glory. 

####ethereal 
**ETHEREAL, CELESTIAL, HEAVENLY, SPIRITUAL.**  
_Ethereal_, derived from the same source as _ether, viz._, the Greek _αίθήρ_, the sky, from _αϊθω_, to light up, cognate with the Latin _œstas_, summer, or _œstus_, heat, in Italian _etere_, implies, literally, that which pertains to, or is formed of, ether, the fluid that is believed to pervade all space beyond the atmosphere of the earth, and, figuratively, the high heavens or home of the gods. _Ethereal_, in chemistry, applies to whatever contains ether, but in ordinary language it has a strong poetical and religious significance.  
_Celestial_ specifically implies that which pertains to the sky or heavens, and, commonly, that which is _exquisite_ or supremely excellent or which relates to the empire or people of China. Whatever is _heavenly_ pertains to or resembles heaven, the firmament or sky, the abode of God and the blessed, and implies the state or condition of absolute bliss. Because of the general religious and the mythological belief that heaven is the abode of the redeemed and the gods who controlled the destinies of mankind, the term has come to designate the _spiritual_ or incorporeal part of humanity, the state of being pure, holy, and heavenly-minded. 

####ethical 
**ETHICAL, MORAL.**  
_Moral_, from Latin _mos, moris_, meaning custom, was Cicero's translation of the Greek _ήθικός_, indicating habitual conduct. Both words, therefore, were meant to refer to a habit of right action habitual with the individual and sanctioned by the custom of the society in which he lived. But _ethical_ has come to refer to the principles of right in the abstract, with reference to the individual character and its complete development in accordance with general human laws; _moral_ refers to action as affecting the community and sanctioned by social and religious law. _Ethical_ has philosophical connotations; _moral_ practical and religious ones. When we speak of something as being _ethically_ right, we suggest that we are going back to first principles and judging it as a matter of abstract right and wrong. When we speak of something as _morally_ wrong, we are thinking especially of the act in relation to society and social judgments. 

####etiquette 
**ETIQUETTE, CEREMONY, DECORUM, FASHION, MANNERS.**  
_Etiquette_, in Old French _estiquet_, a little note, from the German _stichen_, to stick, is really a doublet of _ticket_, and signifies, literally, a ticket on which the forms to be observed on particular occasions were inscribed. Originally, the term was applied to a little piece of paper or note stuck up on the gate of a court. On state or very formal occasions it was customary to send small tickets to invited guests, informing them concerning the parts they were expected to take in the ceremony. From this practice the present meaning of the term doubtless arose, and the word came to signify the forms that should be observed in the ceremonial intercourses of life.  
Of the words included in this article as synonymes of _etiquette, manners_ is the most general, for the derivation and definition of which see [manners](entry://manners). It means simply ways of doing things. _Decorum_ (see [decency](entry://decency)) means _manners_, with special reference to that which is suitable and graceful. _Fashion_ (see [fashion](entry://fashion)) signifies _manners_ with special reference to the habits that happen to prevail in society at the minute. _Etiquette_ indicates the _manners_ that prevail in formal society considered as a well-defined system, in which every detail of conduct is regulated. _Ceremony_ is the _etiquette_ of particular formal occasions, with special reference to external dignity and form (see [form](entry://form)). 

####eugenics 
**EUGENICS, BREEDING.**  
There is no real synonyme for _eugenics_, but the general word _breeding_, which it has partly replaced, may serve the purpose. _Eugenics_, from Greek ευ, well, and _γένος_, race, means the science of producing a good race of human beings, and all that pertains thereto. _Breeding_ (see [breed](entry://breed)) means simply the production of animals or plants, but it has been specialized among raisers of stock, etc., to refer to the production of a good stock or particular kinds of stock, and hence as applied to the development of the lower orders of being it has much the same meaning as _eugenics._

####eulogy 
See [encomium](entry://encomium)

####euphonious 
**EUPHONIOUS, HARMONIOUS.**  
_Euphonious_, from Greek ευ, well, and _φονή_, a sound, meaning a pleasant sound, and _harmonious_ (see [melody](entry://melody)), both mean "agreeable to the ear, " but _harmonious_ is a more positive word than _euphonious. Harmonious_ suggests the presence of sounds whose combination is delightful; _euphonious_ the absence of all sounds which might be unpleasant. _Euphonious_ refers especially to the juxtaposition of sounds in speaking; _harmonious_ to the juxtaposition of musical sounds, in singing, playing, etc. 

####euthanasia 
**EUTHANASIA, EASY DEATH.**  
_Euthanasia_, from Greek _εϋ_, well, and _θάνατος_, death, being a technical word, has no exact synonymes except phrases like _easy death, painless death_, which are simply translations of the Greek term into familiar English. It refers to an easy or painless death, especially one attained through the administration of a drug by a physician in cases of mortal and painful illness. 

####evade 
**EVADE, EQUIVOCATE, PREVARICATE.**  
_Evade_ (see [escape](entry://escape)). _Equivocate_ (see **ambiguity** under [ambiguous](entry://ambiguous)). _Prevaricate_ comes from Latin _prevaricari_, from _prœ_, especially, very, and _varus_, crooked, and originally meant to say something very crooked, to tell a lie.  
These words designate an artful mode of escaping the scrutiny of an inquirer: we _evade_ by artfully turning the subject or calling off the attention of the inquirer; we _equivocate_ by the use of _equivocal_ expressions; we _prevaricate_ by the use of loose and indefinite expressions; we avoid giving satisfaction by _evading;_ we give a false satisfaction by _equivocating:_ we give dissatisfaction by _prevaricating. Evading_ is not so mean a practice as _equivocating:_ it may be sometimes prudent to _evade_ a question which we do not wish to answer; but _equivocations_ are employed for the purposes of falsehood and interest: _prevarications_ are still meaner; and are resorted to mostly by criminals in order to escape detection.  
**EVASION, SHIFT, SUBTERFUGE.** — _Evasion_ is here taken only in the bad sense; _shift_ and _subterfuge_ are modes of _evasion:_ the former signifies that gross kind of _evasion_ by which one attempts to _shift_ off an obligation from one's self; the _subterfuge_, from _subter_, under, and _fugio_, to fly, is a mode of _evasion_ in which one has recourse to some screen or shelter. The _evasion_, in distinction from the others, is resorted to for the gratification of pride or obstinacy: whoever wishes to maintain a bad cause must have recourse to _evasions;_ candid minds despise all _evasions;_ the _shift_ is the trick of a knave, it always serves a paltry, low purpose; he who has not courage to turn open thief will use any _shifts_ rather than not get money dishonestly: the _subterfuge_ is the refuge of one's fears; it is not resorted to from the hope of gain, but from the fear of a loss; not for purposes of interest, but for those of character; he who wants to justify himself in a bad cause has recourse to _subterfuge._

####evanescent 
**EVANESCENT, EPHEMERAL, TRANSITORY**.  
These words all indicate that which endures for only a little space, but there is some difference in the image conveyed in each word. _Evanescent_, from Latin _e_, away, and _vanescere_, about to vanish, means about to vanish away. _Ephemeral_, from Greek _έπί_ and _ήμέρα_, for a day, means enduring but for a day. _Transitory_, from Latin _trans_, beyond, and _itus_, the past participle of _ire_, to go, means about to pass beyond our sight. _Ephemeral_ indicates that which by its very nature cannot endure; _transitory_ that which, as a matter of fact but not of necessity, is not enduring. _Evanescent_ indicates a higher degree of transitoriness suggesting that which is disappearing into thin air, as it were, before our very eyes. 

####evangelical 
**EVANGELICAL, GOSPEL, ORTHODOX.**  
_Gospel_, used as an adjective, is a translation of the Greek _εύαγγελικός_ (from ευ, well, and _άγγελία_, tidings), into Anglo-Saxon _god_, good, and _spell_, story or tale. Both referred specifically to the original documents of the Christian faith, the biographies of Christ, and the message therein delivered. But, as in the case of many other similar pairs of words, the Greek has been specialized to refer to particular sects and tenets. _Evangelical_ means like the original _gospel_, and has been adopted by certain sects, to characterize their attempts to carry out the precepts of the New Testament more literally. _Gospel_ perfection means the standard of perfection enjoined in the Christian gospel; _evangelical_ teaching may refer to the teaching of the New Testament or to the particular teaching of the _evangelical_ sects. _Orthodox_, from Greek _ορθός_, straight, _δόζα_, opinion, means holding the right opinion concerning matters of Christian faith, and refers to matters of intellectual belief, rather than the active practice or emotional faith suggested in _evangelical._ It also refers to the whole body of Christian teaching founded upon the gospel rather than to the gospel itself. 

####even 
**EVEN, SMOOTH, LEVEL, PLAIN.**  
_Even_ (see [equal](entry://equal)). _Smooth_, Anglo-Saxon _smethe_, comes from a Teutonic base signifying creamy. _Level_, Late Latin _libella_, from _libra_, balance, was originally simply the name of a carpenter's instrument for determining that a thing is horizontal. _Plain_ (see [apparent](entry://apparent)).  
_Even_ and _smooth_ are both opposed to roughness; but that which is _even_ is free only from great roughness or irregularities; that which is _smooth_ is free from every degree of roughness, however small: a board is _even_ which has no knots or holes; it is not _smooth_ unless its surface be an entire plane: the ground is said to be _even_, but not _smooth;_ the sky is _smooth_, but not _even. Even_ is to _level_, when applied to the ground, what _smooth_ is to _even;_ the _even_ is free from protuberances and depressions on its exterior surface; the _level_ is free from rises or falls: a path is said to be _even;_ a meadow is _level:_ ice may be _level_, though it is not _even;_ a walk up the side of a hill may be _even_, although the hill itself is the reverse of a _level:_ the _even_ is said of that which unites and forms one uninterrupted surface; but the _level_ is said of things which are at a distance from each other, and are discovered by the eye to be in a parallel line; hence the floor of a room is _even_ with regard to itself; it is _level_ with that of another room. _Evenness_ respects the surface of bodies; plainness respects their direction and freedom from external obstructions: a path is _even_ which has no indentures or footmarks; a path is _plain_ which is not stopped up or interrupted by wood, water, or any other thing intervening.  
When applied figuratively, these words preserve their analogy: an _even_ temper is secured from all violent changes of humor; a _smooth_ speech is divested of everything which can ruffle the temper of others; but the former is always taken in a good sense, and the latter mostly in a bad sense, as evincing an illicit design or purpose to deceive: a _plain_ speech, on the other hand, is divested of everything obscure or figurative, and is consequently a speech free from disguise and easy to be understood.  
_Even_ and _level_ are applied to conduct or condition, the former as regards ourselves, the latter as regards others: he who adopts an _even_ course of conduct is in no danger of putting himself upon a _level_ with those who are otherwise his inferiors. 

####evening 
See [gloaming](entry://gloaming)

####event 
**EVENT, INCIDENT, ACCIDENT, ADVENTURE, OCCURRENCE.**  
_Event_, in Latin _eventus_, participle of _evenire_, to come out, signifies that which falls out or turns up. _Incident_, in Latin _incidens_, from _incidere_, signifies that which falls in or forms a collateral part of anything. _Accident_ (for derivation see [accident](entry://accident)). _Adventure_, from the Latin _advenire_, to come to, signifies what comes to or befalls one. _Occurrence_, from the Latin _ob_, in the way, and _currere_, to learn, signifies that which runs or comes in the way.  
These terms are expressive of what passes in the world, which is the sole signification of the term _event;_ while to that of the other terms are annexed some accessory ideas: an _incident_ is a personal _event;_ an _accident_, an accidental _event_ which happens by the way; an _adventure_, an extraordinary _event;_ an _occurrence_, an ordinary or domestic _event: event_, in its ordinary and limited acceptation, excludes the idea of chance; _accident_ excludes that of design; _incident, adventure_, and _occurrence_ are applicable in both cases.  
_Events_ affect nations and communities as well as individuals; _incidents_ and _adventures_ affect particular individuals; _accidents_ and _occurrences_ affect persons or things particularly or generally, individually or collectively: the making of peace, the loss of a battle, and the death of a prince are national _events;_ the forming a new acquaintance and the revival of an old one are _incidents_ that have an interest for the parties concerned; an escape from shipwreck, an encounter with wild beasts or savages, are _adventures_ which individuals are pleased to relate and others to hear; a fire, the fall of a house, the breaking of a limb, are _accidents_ or _occurrences;_ a robbery and the death of individuals are properly _occurrences_ which afford subject for a newspaper and excite an interest in the reader.  
_Event_, when used for individuals, is always of greater importance than an _incident._ The settlement of a young person in life, the adoption of an employment, or the taking a wife, are _events_, but not _incidents;_ while, on the other hand, the setting out on a journey or the return, the purchase of a house, and the despatch of a vessel are characterized as _incidents_, and not _events._  
It is further to be observed that _accident, event_, and _occurrence_ are said only of that which is supposed really to happen: _incidents_ and _adventures_ are often fictitious; in this case the _incident_ cannot be too important, nor the _ad-venture_ too marvellous. History records the _events_ of nations; plays require to be full of _incident_ in order to render them interesting; romances and novels derive most of their charms from the extravagance of the _adventures_ which they describe; periodical works supply the public with information respecting daily _occurrences._

####evil 
**EVIL or ILL, MISFORTUNE, HARM, MISCHIEF.**  
_Evil_, in its full sense, comprehends every quality which is not good, and consequently the other terms express only modifications of _evil._ The word is, however, more limited in its application than its meaning, and admits, therefore, of a just comparison with the other words here mentioned. They are all taken in the sense of _evils_ produced by some external cause, or _evils_ inherent in the object and arising out of it. The _evil_, or, in its contracted form, the _ill_, befalls a person; the _misfortune_ comes upon him; the _harm_, originally Anglo-Saxon _hearm_, is taken, or one receives the _harm; mischief_ is compounded of French _mes,_  
Latin _minus_, lacking in, less, and _chef_, Latin _caput_, head, and means foolishness, something lacking in sense and wit, hence something harmful or annoying to others.  
_Evil_, in its limited application, is taken for _evils_ of the greatest magnitude; it is that which is _evil_ without any mitigation or qualification of circumstances. The _misfortune_ is a minor _evil;_ it depends upon the opinion and circumstances of the individual; what is a _misfortune_ in one respect may be the contrary in another respect. An untimely death, the fracture or loss of a limb, are denominated _evils;_ the loss of a vessel, the overturning of a carriage, and the like are _misfortunes_, inasmuch as they tend to the diminution of property; but as all the casualties of life may produce various consequences, it may sometimes happen that that which seems to have come upon us by our _ill_ fortune turns out ultimately of the greatest benefit; in this respect, therefore, _misfortune_ is but a partial _evil:_ of _evil_ it is likewise observable that it has no respect to the sufferer as a moral agent; but _misfortune_ is used in regard to such things as are controllable or otherwise by human foresight. The _evil_ which befalls a man is opposed only to the good which he in general experiences; but the _misfortune_ is opposed to the good fortune or the prudence of the individual. Sickness is an _evil_, let it be endured or caused by whatever circumstances it may; it is a _misfortune_ for an individual to come in the way of having this _evil_ brought on himself: his own relative condition in the scale of being is here referred to.  
_Harm_ and _mischief_ are species of minor _evils_, the former of which is much less specific than the latter both in the nature and cause of the _evil._ A person takes _harm_ from circumstances that are not known; the _mischief_ is done to him from some positive and immediate circumstance. He who takes cold takes _harm_, the cause of which, however, may not be known or suspected: a fall from a horse is attended with _mischief_ if it occasion a fracture or any _evil_ to the body. _Evil_ and _misfortune_ respect persons only as the objects; _harm_ and _mischief_ are said of inanimate things as the object. A tender plant takes _harm_ from being exposed to the cold air; _mischief_ is done to it when its branches are violently broken off or its roots are laid bare. See also [bad](entry://bad)

####evolution 
**EVOLUTION, DEVELOPMENT.**  
_Evolution_, from Latin e, out, and _volvere_, to roll, unfold, and _development_, from _de_, down, and _volvere_, to roll, have originally the same meaning, but _evolution_ has become a somewhat technical term referring to what in a more general way is indicated in _development. Development_ refers to the orderly unfolding of plant or animal life or to the courses of history, _evolution_ to this same orderly unfolding with specific reference to the doctrines and laws of _development_ formulated by the natural scientists of the nineteenth century, especially Darwin, and extended from the field of natural science to all fields. 

####exact 
**EXACT, EXTORT.**  
_Exact_, in Latin _exactus_, participle of _exigere_, to drive out, signifies the exercise of simple force; but _extort_, from _extortus_, participle of _extorquere_, to wring out, marks the exercise of unusual force. In the application, therefore, to _exact_ is to demand with force — it is commonly an act of injustice: to _extort_ is to get with violence — it is an act of tyranny. The collector of the revenue _exacts_ when he gets from the people more than he is authorized to take: an arbitrary prince _extorts_ from his conquered subjects whatever he can grasp at. In the figurative sense, deference, obedience, applause, and admiration are _exacted:_ a confession, an acknowledgment, a discovery, and the like are _extorted._  
**EXACT, NICE, PARTICULAR, PUNCTUAL.** — _Exact_ (see [accurate](entry://accurate)). _Nice_ in Middle English means foolish or simple, from Old French _nice_, lazy, simple, Latin _nescius_, ignorant, compounded of _ne_, not, and _scius_, knowing. From the earlier meaning of simple the meaning of fastidious, careful in little things, developed. _Particular_ means attentive to each little _particle. Punctual_, from the Latin _punctum_, a point, signifies keeping to a point.  
_Exact_ and _nice_ are to be compared in their application either to persons or to things: _particular_ and _punctual_, only in application to persons. To be _exact_ is to arrive at perfection; to be _nice_ is to be free from faults; to be _particular_ is to be _nice_ in certain _particulars;_ to be _punctual_ is to be _exact_ in certain points. We are _exact_ in our conduct or in what we do, _nice_ and _particular_ in our mode of doing it, _punctual_ as to the time and season for doing it. It is necessary to be _exact_ in our accounts; to be _nice_ as an artist in the choice and distribution of colors; to be _particular_ as a man of business, in the number and the details of merchandises that are to be delivered out; to be _punctual_ in observing the hour of the day that has been fixed upon.  
_Exactness_ and _punctuality_ are always taken in a good sense; they designate an attention to that which cannot be dispensed with: they form a part of one's duty: _niceness_ and _particularity_ are not always taken in the best sense; they designate an excessive attention to things of inferior importance, to matters of taste and choice. Early habits of method and regularity will make a man very _exact_ in the performance of all his duties, and _particularly punctual_ in his payments: an over-_niceness_ in the observance of mechanical rules often supplies the want of genius; it is the mark of a contracted mind to amuse itself with _particularities_ about dress, personal appearance, furniture, and the like.  
When _exact_ and _nice_ are applied to things, the former expresses more than the latter; we speak of an _exact_ resemblance and a _nice_ distinction. The _exact_ point is that which we wish to reach; the _nice_ point is that which it is difficult to keep.

####examination 
**EXAMINATION, SEARCH, INQUIRY, RESEARCH, INVESTIGATION, SCRUTINY.**  
_Examination_ (see [discuss](entry://discuss)). _Search_ comes from Old French _cercher_, Latin _circare_, to go around in a circle, to look everywhere. _Inquiry_ (see [ask](entry://ask)). _Research_ is an intensive of _search. Investigation_, from the Latin _vestigium_, a track, signifies seeking by the tracks or footsteps. _Scrutiny_, from the Latin _scruter_, to search, and _scruta_, broken pieces, signifies looking for among rubbish, to ransack.  
_Examination_ is the most general of these terms, which all agree in expressing an active effort to find out that which is unknown. An _examination_ may be made without any particular effort, and may be made of things that are open to the observation, as to _examine_ the face or features of a person, or anatomically to _examine_ the body: a _search_ is a close _examination_ into matters that are hidden or less obvious: as to _search_ the person or papers of one that is suspected, to _search_ a house for stolen goods.  
_Examinations_ may be made by putting questions; an _inquiry_ is always made in this manner. We may _examine_ persons or things; we _inquire_ of persons and into things: an _examination_ of persons is always done for some specific and public purpose; one person _inquires_ of another only for private purposes; a student is _examined_ for the purpose of ascertaining his progress in learning; an offender is _examined_ in order to ascertain his guilt; a person _inquires_ as to the residence of another, or the road to be taken, and the like.  
In the moral application of these terms, the _examination_ is, as before, a general and indefinite action, which may either be confined simply to those matters which present themselves to the mind of the _examiner_ or it may be extended to all points: the _search_ is a laborious _examination_ into that which is remote; the _inquiry_ is extended to _examination_ into that which is doubtful.  
A _research_ is a remote _search;_ an _investigation_ is a minute _inquiry;_ a _scrutiny_ is a strict _examination._ Learned men of inquisitive tempers make their _researches_ into antiquity: magistrates _investigate_ doubtful and mysterious affairs; physicians _investigate_ the causes of diseases; men _scrutinize_ the actions of those whom they hold in suspicion. Acuteness and penetration are peculiarly requisite in making _researches_, patience and perseverance are the necessary qualifications of the _investigator;_ a quick discernment will essentially aid the _scrutinizer._  
**EXAMINE, SEARCH, EXPLORE.** — _Examine_ and _search_ (see above for both). _Explore_, in Latin _explore_, compounded of _ex_, out, and _plorare_, to flow, signifies to make to flow out, to look for something until it is found.  
These words are here considered as they designate the looking upon places or objects, in order to get acquainted with them. To _examine_ expresses a less effort than to _search_, and this expresses less than to _explore._ We _examine_ objects that are near; we _search_ those that are hidden or removed at a certain distance; we _explore_ those that are unknown or very distant. The painter _examines_ a landscape in order to take a sketch of it; the botanist _searches_ after curious plants; the inquisitive traveller _explores_ unknown regions. An author _examines_ the books from which he intends to draw his authorities; the antiquarian _searches_ every corner in which he hopes to find a monument of antiquity; the classic scholar _explores_ the learning and wisdom of the ancients.

####example 
**EXAMPLE, PATTERN, ENSAMPLE.**  
_Example_, in Latin _exemplum_, from Latin _ex_, from, and _emere_, to take, means that from which something is to be imitated or taken. _Pattern_ (see [copy](entry://copy)). _Ensample_ is an Anglo-French corruption of Latin _exemplum._  
All these words are taken for that which ought to be followed: but the _example_ must be followed generally; the _pattern_ must be followed particularly, not only as to what, but how a thing is to be done: the former serves as a guide to the judgment; the latter to guide the actions. The _example_ comprehends what is either to be followed or to be avoided; the _pattern_ only that which is to be followed or copied: the _ensample_ is a species of _example_, the word being employed only in the solemn style. The _example_ may be presented either in the object itself or the description of it; the _pattern_ displays itself most completely in the object itself; the _ensample_ exists only in the description. Those who know what is right should set the _example_ of practising it; and those who persist in doing wrong must be made an _example_ to deter others from doing the same: everyone, let his age and station be what it may, may afford a _pattern_ of Christian virtue; the child may be a _pattern_ to his playmates of diligence and dutifulness; the citizen may be a _pattern_ to his fellow-citizens of sobriety, and conformity to the laws; the soldier may be a _pattern_ of obedience to his comrades: our Saviour has left us an _example_ of Christian perfection which we ought to imitate, although we cannot copy it: the Scripture characters are drawn as _ensamples_ for our learning.  
**EXAMPLE, PRECEDENT.** — _Example_ (see above). _Precedent_, from the Latin _precedens_, preceding, signifies by distinction that preceding which is entitled to notice. Both these terms apply to that which may be followed or made a rule; but the _example_ is commonly present or before our eyes; the _precedent_ is properly something past; the _example_ may derive its authority from the individual; the _precedent_ acquires its sanction from time and common consent: we are led by the _example_, or we copy the _example;_ we are guided or governed by the _precedent._ The former is a private and often a partial affair; the latter is a public and often a national concern; we quote _examples_ in literature and _precedents_ in law.  
**EXAMPLE, INSTANCE.** — _Example_ refers in this case to the thing. _Instance_, from the Latin _instans_, standing on or in, signifies that which stands or serves as a resting-point.  
The _example_ is set forth by way of illustration or instruction; the _instance_ is adduced by way of evidence or proof. Every _instance_ may serve as an _example_, but every _example_ is not an _instance._ The _example_ consists of moral or intellectual objects; the _instance_ consists of actions only, or of what serves as a proof. Rules are illustrated by _examples;_ characters are illustrated by _instances:_ the best mode of instructing children is by furnishing them with _examples_ for every rule that is laid down; the Roman history furnishes us with many extraordinary _instances_ of self-devotion for their country. 

####exasperate 
See [aggravate](entry://aggravate)

####exceed 
**EXCEED, EXCEL, SURPASS, TRANSCEND, OUTDO.**  
_Exceed_, from the Latin _excedo_, compounded of _ex_, out, and_ cedere_, to pass, means to pass out of, or beyond, the line, and is the general term. _Surpass_, compounded of French _sur_, Latin _super_, beyond, and French _passer_, to pass, from Latin _passus_, step, is one species of exceeding. _Excel_, compounded of _ex_ and _cellere_, to lift or move over, found only in compounds, is another species.  
_Exceed_ is applied mostly to things in the sense of going beyond in measure, degree, quantity, and quality; one thing _exceeds_ another in magnitude, height, or any other dimensions; a person's success _exceeds_ his expectations.  
It is taken either in an indifferent or in a bad sense, particularly in regard to persons, as a person _exceeds_ his instructions or _exceeds_ the due measure.  
To _excel_ and _surpass_ signify to _exceed_, or be superior in that which is good. To _excel_ may be used with reference to all persons generally, as a person strives to _excel;_ to _surpass_ is used in regard to particular objects, as to _surpass_ another in any trial of skill.  
When _excel_ is used in respect of particular objects, it is more general in its sense than _surpass:_ the Dutch and Italians formerly _excelled_ the English in painting; one person may _surpass_ another in bravery, or a thing may _surpass_ one's expectations. Men _excel_ in learning, arts, or arms; competitors _surpass_ one another in feats of agility.  
The derivatives _excessive_ and _excellent_ have this obvious distinction between them, that the former always signifies _exceeding_ in that which ought not to be _exceeded;_ and the latter _exceeding_ in that where it is honorable to _exceed:_ he who is habitually _excessive_ in any of his indulgences must be insensible to the _excellence_ of a temperate fife.  
_Transcend_, from _trans_, beyond, _scandere_, to climb, signifies to climb beyond; and _outdo_ — that is, to do out of the ordinary course, are particular modes of _excelling_ or _exceeding._ The genius of Homer _transcends_ that of almost every poet; Heliogabalus _outdid_ every other emperor in extravagance. 

####excellence 
**EXCELLENCE, SUPERIORITY.**  
_Excellence_ is an absolute term; _superiority_ is a relative term; many may have _excellence_ in the same degree, but they must have _superiority_ in different degrees; _superiority_ is often superior _excellence_, but in many eases they are applied to different objects. There is a moral _excellence_ attainable by all who have the will to strive after it; but there is an intellectual and physical _superiority_ which is above the reach of our wishes and is granted to a few only.

####excess 
**EXCESS, SUPERFLUITY, REDUNDANCY.**  
_Excess_ is that which exceeds any measure; _superfluity_, from _super_, over, and _fluere_, to flow, and _redundancy_, from _re._ back, and _unda_, a wave, to stream back or over, signify an _excess_ of a good measure. We may have an _excess_ of heat or cold, wet or dry, when we have more than the ordinary quantity, but we have a _superfluity_ of provisions when we have more than we want. _Excess_ is applicable to any object, but _superfluity_ and _redundancy_ are species of excess, the former applicable in a particular manner to that which is an object of our desire, and _redundancy_ to matters of expression or feeling. We may have an _excess_ of prosperity or adversity, a _superfluity_ of good things, and a _redundancy_ of speech or words.  
**EXCESSIVE, IMMODERATE, INTEMPERATE.** — The _excessive_ is beyond measure; the _immoderate_, from _modus_, a mode or measure, is without measure; the _intemperate_, from _tempus_, a time or term, is that which is not kept within bounds.  
_Excessive_ designates _excess_ in general; _immoderate_ and _intemperate_ designate _excess_ in moral agents. The _excessive_ lies simply in the thing which exceeds any given point: the _immoderate_ lies in the passions which range to a boundless extent: the _intemperate_ lies in the will which is under no control. Hence we speak of an _excessive_ thirst physically considered, an _immoderate_ ambition or lust of power, an _intemperate_ indulgence, an _intemperate_ warmth. _Excessive_ admits of degrees; what is _excessive_ may exceed in a greater or less degree: _immoderate_ and _intemperate_ mark a positively great degree of _excess,_ the former still higher than the latter: _immoderate_ is in fact the highest conceivable degree of _excess._ The _excessive_ use of anything will always be attended with some evil consequence: the _immoderate_ use of wine will rapidly tend to the ruin of him who is guilty of the excess: the _intemperate_ use of wine will proceed by a more gradual but not less sure process to his ruin.

####exchange 
**EXCHANGE, BARTER, TRUCK, COMMUTE.**  
To _exchange_ (see [change](entry://change)) is the general term signifying to take one for another, or put one thing in the place of another; the rest are but modes of _exchanging._ To _barter_ is to _exchange_ one article of trade for another, from Old French _barater_, to cheat, beguile, a word of doubtful origin, possibly Celtic. To _truck_ is a familiar term to express a familiar action for _exchanging_ one article of private property for another. _Commute_, from the Latin syllable _cum_, with, and _mutare_, to change, signifies an _exchanging_ one mode of punishment for another, or one mode of payment for another: we may _exchange_ one book for another; traders _barter_ trinkets for gold-dust; coachmen or stablemen _truck_ a whip for a handkerchief; government _commutes_ the punishment of death for that of banishment.  
_Commute_ is now used, in a special sense, to refer to the travelling to and fro of people who dwell in the suburb of a city and do their business and find their pleasure within the city itself. 

####excite 
**EXCITE, INCITE, PROVOKE.**  
To _excite_ (see [awaken](entry://awaken)) is said more particularly of the inward feelings; _incite_ (see [encourage](entry://encourage)) is said of the external actions; _provoke_ (see [aggravate](entry://aggravate)) is said of both. A person's passions arc-excited; he is _incited_ by any particular passion to a course of conduct; a particular feeling is _provoked_, or he is _provoked_ by some feeling to a particular step. Wit and conversation _excite_ mirth; men are _incited_ by a lust for gain to fraudulent practices; they are _provoked_ by the opposition of others to _intemperate_ language and intemperate measures. To _excite_ is very frequently used in a physical acceptation; _incite_ always, and _provoke_ mostly, in a moral application. We speak of _exciting_ hunger, thirst, or perspiration; of _inciting_ to noble actions; of _provoking_ impertinence, _provoking_ scorn or resentment. When _excite_ and _provoke_ are applied to similar objects, the former designates a much stronger action than the latter. A thing may _excite_ a smile, but it _provokes_ laughter; it may _excite_ displeasure, but it _provokes_ anger; it may _excite_ joy or sorrow, but it _provokes_ to madness.

####excommunicate 
**EXCOMMUNICATE, ANATHEMATIZE.**  
_Excommunicate_ and. _anathematize_ are used in similar connections to refer to the denunciation of individuals by the Catholic Church, but they differ somewhat in meaning. _Excommunicate_, from Latin _ex_, out, and _communis_, common, means to banish from the common society and privileges of the church and the good graces and services of all Christian people. _Anathematize_, from Greek _ανάθημα_, means to denounce formally and publicly, and may refer to opinions and actions as well as individuals. It does not necessarily include, however, the formal act of excommunication. Both terms may be extended to refer to punishment by any society, or formal denunciation of any sort.

####excursion 
**EXCURSION, RAMBLE, TOUR, TRIP, JAUNT.**  
_Excursion_ signifies going out of one's course, from the Latin _ex_ and _cursus_, the course or prescribed path: a _ramble_ is a going without any course or regular path (see _ramble_ under WANDER). A _tour_ is a circuitous course: a _trip_, Middle English _trippen_, from base _trap_, meaning tread, found in tramp, means as a verb to tread lightly, and, as a substantive, a pleasant walk or, at present, any journey; _jaunt_ comes from Old French _jaunts_, meaning toil, exercise. To go abroad in a carriage is an idle _excursion_, or one taken for mere pleasure: travellers who are not contented with what is not to be seen from a highroad make frequent _excursions_ into the interior of the country. Those who are fond of rural scenery, and pleased to follow the bent of their inclinations, make frequent _rambles._ Those who set out upon a sober scheme of enjoyment from travelling are satisfied with making the _tour_ of some one country or more. Those who have not much time for pleasure take _trips._ Those who have no better means of spending their time make _jaunts._

####excuse 
**EXCUSE, PARDON.**  
We _excuse_ (see [apologize](entry://apologize)) a person or thing by exempting him from blame. We _pardon_ (from Late Latin _perdonare_, to give entirely or freely) by remitting the punishment for the offence one has committed.  
We _excuse_ a small fault, we _pardon_ a great fault; we excuse that which personally affects ourselves; we _pardon_ that which offends against morals: we may _excuse_ as equals: we can _pardon_ only as superiors. We exercise goodnature in _excusing:_ we exercise generosity or mercy in _pardoning._ Friends _excuse_ one another for the unintentional omission of formalities; it is the prerogative of the king to _pardon_ criminals whose offences will admit of _pardon:_ the violation of good manners is _inexcusable_ in those who are cultivated; falsehood is _unpardonable_ even in a child.

####execute 
**EXECUTE, FULFIL, PERFORM.**  
_Execute_ (see [accomplish](entry://accomplish)), in Latin _executus_, participle of _exsequi_, compounded of _ex_, out, and _sequi_, to follow, is to follow up to the end. To _fulfil_ is to fill up to the full of what is wanted. _Perform_ comes from Old French _parfournir_, from Latin _per_, thoroughly, and Old French _fournir_, to furnish, Old High German _frumjan_, to provide; and meant to furnish completely, to carry through to the end.  
To _execute_ is more than to _fulfil_, and to _fulfil_ than to _perform._ To _execute_ is to bring about an end; it involves active measures and is peculiarly applicable to that which is extraordinary or that which requires particular spirit and talents; schemes of ambition are _executed:_ to _fulfil_ is to satisfy a moral obligation; it is applicable to those duties in which rectitude and equity are involved; we _fulfil_ the duties of citizens: to _perform_ is to carry through by simple action or labor; it is more particularly applicable to the ordinary and regular business of life; we _perform_ a work or a task. One _executes_ according to one's own intentions or those of others; the soldier _executes_ the orders of his general; the merchant _executes_ the commissions of his correspondent: one _fulfils_ according to the wishes and expectations of one's self or others; it is the part of an honest man to enter into no engagements which he cannot _fulfil;_ it is the part of a dutiful son, by diligence and assiduity, to endeavor to _fulfil_ the expectations of an anxious parent: one _performs_, according to circumstances, what suits one's own convenience and purposes; every good man is anxious to _perform_ his part in life with credit and advantage to himself and others.

####exercise 
**EXERCISE, PRACTICE.**  
_Exercise_, in Latin _exercere_, from Latin _ex_, out, and _arcere_, to enclose, meant originally to drive out of an enclosure, to set at work. _Practice_, from the Greek _πράσσειν_, to do, signifies to perform a part.  
These terms are equally applied to the actions and habits of men; but we _exercise_ in that where the powers are called forth; we _practice_ in that where frequency and habitude of action are requisite: we _exercise_ an art; we _practice_ a profession: we may both _exercise_ and _practice_ a virtue; but the former is that which the particular occurrence calls forth, and which seems to demand a peculiar effort of the mind; the latter is that which is done daily and ordinarily: thus we in a peculiar manner are said to _exercise_ patience, fortitude, or forbearance; to _practice_ charity, kindness, benevolence, and the like.  
A similar distinction characterizes these words as nouns, the former applying solely to the powers of the body or mind, the latter solely to the mechanical operation: the health of the body and the vigor of the mind are alike impaired by the want of _exercise_; in every art _practice_ is an indispensable requisite for acquiring perfection: the _exercise_ of the memory is of the first importance in the education of children; constant _practice_ in writing is almost the only means by which the art of penmanship is acquired. 

####exert 
**EXERT, EXERCISE.**  
The employment of some power or qualification that belongs to one's self is the common idea conveyed by these terms; but _exert_ (see [endeavor](entry://endeavor)) may be used for what is internal or external of one's self; _exercise_ (see above) only for that which forms an express part of one's self; hence we speak of _exerting_ one's strength, or _exerting_ one's voice, or _exerting_ one's influence: of _exercising_ one's limbs, _exercising_ one's understanding, or _exercising_ one's tongue. _Exert_ is often used only for an individual act of calling forth into action; _exercise_ always conveys the idea of repeated or continued _exertion;_ thus a person who calls to another _exerts_ his voice; he who speaks aloud for any length of time _exercises_ his lungs.

####exhort 
**EXHORT, PERSUADE.**  
_Exhort_, in Latin _exhorter_, compounded of _ex_, intensive, and _hortari_, to persuade, meant to persuade earnestly. _Persuade_ (see **conviction** under [convict](entry://convict)).  
_Exhortation_ has more of impelling in it; _persuasion_, more of drawing: a superior _exhorts;_ his words carry authority with them, and rouse to action: a friend and an equal _persuades;_ he wins and draws by the agreeableness or kindness of his expressions. _Exhortations_ are employed only in matters of duty or necessity; _persuasions_ are employed in matters of pleasure or convenience. 

####exigency 
**EXIGENCY, EMERGENCY.**  
Necessity is the idea which is common to the signification of these terms: _exigency_, from the Latin _exigere_, to force out, to demand, expresses what the case demands; and _emergency_, from _emergere_, to arise out of, denotes what rises out of the case.  
The _exigency_ is more common, but less pressing; the _emergency_ is imperious when it comes, but comes less frequently: a prudent traveller will never carry more money with him than what will supply the _exigencies_ of his journey; and in case of an _emergency_ Will rather borrow of his friends than risk his property. 

####exile 
See [banish](entry://banish); [proscribe](entry://proscribe)

####exist 
**EXIST, LIVE.**  
_Live_, Anglo-Saxon _libban_, is the native English word corresponding to the Latin _exist_, for which see [be](entry://be).  
_Existence_ is the property of all things in the universe; _life_, which is the inherent power of motion, is the particular property communicated by the Divine Being to some parts only of His creation: _exist_, therefore, is the general, and _live_ the specific term: whatever _lives, exists_ according to a certain mode; but many things _exist_ without _living:_ when we wish to speak of things in their most abstract relation, we say they _exist;_ when we wish to characterize the form of _existence_ we say they _live. Existence_, in its proper sense, is the attribute which we commonly ascribe to the Divine Being, and it is that which is immediately communicable by Himself; _life_ is that mode of _existence_ which He has made to be communicable by other objects besides Himself: _existence_ is taken only in its strict and proper sense, independent of all its attributes and appendages; but _life_ is regarded in connection with the means by which it is supported, as animal life, or vegetable life. In like maimer, when speaking of spiritual objects, _exist_ retains its abstract sense, and _live_ is employed to denote an active principle: animosities should never _exist_ in the mind; and everything which is calculated to keep them _alive_ should be kept at a distance. 

####exit 
**EXIT, DEPARTURE.**  
Both these words are metaphorically employed for death or a passage out of this life; the former is borrowed from the act of going off the stage; the latter from the act of setting off on a journey. _Exit_ seems to convey the idea of volition; for we speak of making our _exit; departure_ designates simply the event; the hour of a man's _departure_ is not made known to him. When we speak of an _exit_, we think only of the place left; when we speak of a _departure_, we think of the place gone to: the unbeliever may talk of bis _exit;_ the Christian most commonly speaks of his _departure._

####exonerate 
**EXONERATE, EXCULPATE.**  
_Exonerate_, from _onus_, a burden, signifies to take off the burden of a charge or of guilt: to _exculpate_, from _culpa_, a fault or blame, is to throw off the blame: the first is the act of another; the second is one's own act: we _exonerate_ him upon whom a charge has lain, or who has the load of guilt; we _exculpate_ ourselves when there is any danger of being blamed: circumstances may sometimes tend to _exonerate;_ the explanation of some person is requisite to _exculpate:_ in a case of dishonesty, the absence of an individual at the moment when the act was committed will altogether _exonerate_ him from suspicion; it is fruitless for any one to attempt to _exculpate_ himself from the charge of faithlessness who is detected in conniving at the dishonesty of others.

####expedient 
**EXPEDIENT, RESOURCE.**  
The _expedient_ is an artificial means; the _resource_ is a natural means: a cunning man is fruitful in _expedients;_ a fortunate man abounds in _resources:_ Robinson Crusoe adopted every _expedient_ in order to prolong his existence at a time when his _resources_ were at the lowest ebb.  
**EXPEDIENT, FIT.** — _Expedient_, from the Latin _expedire_, present participial stem, _expedient_ (compounded of _ex_, out, and _pedem_, foot, and meaning to take one's feet out, to be ready to start) supposes a certain degree of necessity from circumstances; _fit_ for the purpose signifies simply an agreement with, or suitability to, the circumstances: what is _expedient_ must _befit_, because it is called for; what is _fit_ need not be _expedient_, for it may not be required. The _expediency_ of a thing depends altogether upon the outward circumstances; the _fitness_ is determined by a moral rule: it is imprudent not to do that which is _expedient;_ it is disgraceful to do that which is _unfit:_ it is _expedient_ for him who wishes to prepare for death occasionally to take an account of his life; it is not _fit_ for him who is about to die to dwell with anxiety on the things of this life.

####experience 
**EXPERIENCE, EXPERIMENT, TRIAL, PROOF, TEST.**  
_Experience_ and _experiment_, from the Latin _ex_, intensive, and _periri_, to make a trial of, mean that which is learned through personal trial. _Try_ comes from Old French _trier_, originally from Late Latin _tritare_, to rub, pulverize, separate, purify. _Proof_ signifies either the act of _proving_, from the Latin _probare_, to make good, or the thing made good, _proved_ to be good. _Test_ comes from the Italian _testa_, a vessel in which metals are tried.  
By all the actions implied in these terms we endeavor to arrive at a certainty respecting some unknown particular: _experience_ is that which has been tried; an _experiment_ is the thing to be tried; _experience_ is certain, as it is a deduction from the past for the service of the present; the _experiment_ is uncertain and serves a future purpose: _experience_ is an unerring guide, which no man can desert without falling into error; _experiments_ may fail, or be superseded by others more perfect.  
_Experience_ serves to lead us to moral truth; _experiments_ aid us in ascertaining speculative truth: we profit by _experience_ to rectify practice; we make _experiments_ in theoretical inquiries: he, therefore, who makes _experiments_ in matters of _experience_ rejects a steady and definitive mode of coming at the truth of one that is variable and uncertain, and that, too, in matters of the first moment.  
The _experiment, trial_, and _proof_ have equally the character of uncertainty; but the _experiment is_ employed only in matters of an intellectual nature; the _trial_ is employed in matters of a personal nature, on physical as well as mental objects; the _proof_ is employed in moral subjects: we make an _experiment_ in order to know whether a thing be true or false; we make a _trial_ in order to know whether it be capable or incapable, convenient or inconvenient, useful or the contrary; we put a thing to the _proof_ in order to determine whether it be good or bad, real or unreal: _experiments_ tend to confirm opinions; the philosopher doubts every position which cannot be demonstrated by repeated _experiments; trials_ are of absolute necessity in directing our conduct, our taste, and our choice; we judge of our strength or skill by _trials;_ we judge of the effect of colors by _trials_, and the like: the _proof is_ the _trial_ that proves; it determines the judgment in the knowledge of men and things; the _proof_ of men's characters and merits is best made by observing their conduct. The _test_ is the most decisive kind, of _proof_, whence the phrase "to stand the _test. "_  
The _proof_ and _test_ may be taken for that which serves to prove, with the same distinction: to give _proofs_ of sincerity; ridicule is not the _test_ of truth.

####explain 
**EXPLAIN, EXPOUND, INTERPRET.**  
_Explain_ signifies to make _plain_ (see [apparent](entry://apparent)). _Expound_, from the Latin _expono_, compounded of _ex_, out, and _ponere_, to place or set, signifies to set forth in detail. _Interpret_, in Latin _interpres_, an agent, a broker, is compounded of _inter_, between, and possibly _pretium_, price, indicating a go-between in business and financial transactions; then a go-between in other affairs, especially between people speaking different languages.  
To _explain_ is the generic, the rest are specific: to _expound_ and _interpret_ are each modes of _explaining._ Single words or sentences are _explained;_ a whole work, or considerable parts of it, are _expounded;_ the sense of any writing or symbolical sign is _interpreted._ It is the business of the philologist to _explain_ the meaning of words by a suitable definition; it is the business of the divine to _expound_ Scripture; it is the business of the antiquarian to _interpret_ the meaning of old inscriptions or of hieroglyphics. An _explanation_ serves to assist the understanding to supply a deficiency, and remove obscurity; an _exposition_ is an ample _explanation_, in which minute particulars are detailed and the connection of events in the narrative is kept up; it serves to assist the memory and awaken the attention: both the _explanation_ and _exposition_ are employed in clearing up the sense of things as they are, but the _interpretation_ is more arbitrary; it often consists of affixing or giving a sense to things which they have not previously had; hence it is that the same passages in authors admit of different _interpretations_, according to the character or views of the commentator.  
To _explain_ and _interpret_ are not confined to what is written or said, they are employed likewise with regard to the actions of men; _exposition_ is, however, used only with regard to writings. The major part of the misunderstandings and animosities which arise among men might easily be obviated by a timely _explanation;_ it is the characteristic of good-nature to _interpret_ the looks and actions of men as favorably as possible. The _explanation_ may sometimes flow out of circumstances; the _interpretation_ is always the act of a voluntary and rational agent. The discovery of a plot or secret scheme will serve to _explain_ the mysterious and strange conduct of such as were previously acquainted with it. According to an old proverb, "Silence gives consent"; for thus at least they are pleased to _interpret_ it who are interested in the decision.  
**EXPLAIN, ILLUSTRATE, ELUCIDATE.** — _Explain_ (see above). _Illustrate_, in Latin _illuslratus_, participle of _illustrare_, to throw light on, signifies to make a thing bright, or easy to be surveyed and examined. _Elucidate_, in Latin _elucidatus_, participle of _elucido_, from _lux_, light, signifies to bring forth into the light.  
To _explain_ is simply to render intelligible; to _illustrate_ and _elucidate_ are to give additional clearness: everything requires to be _explained_ to one who is ignorant of it; but the best informed will require to have abstruse subjects _illustrated_ and obscure subjects _elucidated._ We always _explain_ when we _illustrate_ or _elucidate_, and we always _elucidate_ when we _illustrate_, but not _vice versa._ We _explain_ by reducing compounds to simples, and generals to particulars; we _illustrate_ by means of examples, similes, and allegorical figures; we _elucidate_ by commentaries or the statement of facts. Words are the common subject of _explanation;_ moral truths require _illustration;_ poetical allusions and dark passages in writers require _elucidation._  
**EXPLANATORY, EXPLICIT, EXPRESS.** — _Explanatory_ signifies containing or belonging to _explanation. Explicit_, in Latin _explicatus_, from _explicare_, to unfold, signifies unfolded or laid open. _Express_, in Latin _expressus_, the past participle of _exprimere_, to press out, signifies the same as expressed or delivered in specific terms.  
The _explanatory_ is that which is superadded to clear up difficulties or obscurities. A letter is _explanatory_ which contains an _explanation_ of something preceding, in lieu of anything new. The _explicit_ is that which of itself obviates every difficulty; an _explicit_ letter, therefore, will leave nothing that requires _explanation_;__ the _explicit_ admits of a free use of words; the _express_ requires them to be unambiguous. A person ought to be _explicit_ when he enters into an engagement; he ought to be _express_ when he gives commands.

####expostulate 
**EXPOSTULATE, REMONSTRATE **  
_Expostulate_, from _postulare_, to demand, signifies to demand reasons for a thing. _Remonstrate_, from _monstrare_, to show, signifies to show reasons against a thing.  
We _expostulate_ in a tone of authority; we _remonstrate_ in a tone of complaint. He who _expostulates_ passes a censure and claims to be heard; he who _remonstrates_ presents his case and _requests_ to be heard. _Expostulation_ may often be the precursor of violence; _remonstrance_ mostly rests on the force of reason and representation: he who admits of _expostulation_ from an inferior undermines his own authority; he who is deaf to the _remonstrances_ of his friends is far gone in folly; the _expostulation_ is mostly on matters of personal interest; the _remonstrance_ may as often be made on matters of propriety. The Scythian ambassadors _expostulated_ with Alexander against his invasion of their country; King Richard _expostulated_ with Wat Tyler on the subject of his insurrection; Artabanes _remonstrated_ with Xerxes on the folly of his projected invasion. 

####expound 
See [explain](entry://explain)

####express 
**EXPRESS, DECLARE, SIGNIFY, TESTIFY, UTTER.**  
All these terms are taken in the sense of communicating to others. To _express_, from the Latin _exprimere_, or _ex_, out, and _premere_, to press, signifying to bring out by a particular effort, is the general term. To _declare_ and the other terms are different modes of _expressing_, varying in the manner and circumstances of the action. To _express_ is the simple act of communication, resulting from our circumstances as social agents; to _declare_ is to _express_ clearly and openly. A person may _express_ his opinions to an individual, but to _declare_ is to make clear or known to several. We may _express_ directly or indirectly; we _declare_ directly and sometimes loudly.  
Words, looks, gestures, or movements serve to _express;_ actions and things may sometimes _declare:_ sometimes we cannot _express_ our contempt in so strong a manner as by preserving a perfect silence when we are required to speak; an act of hostility on the part of a nation is as much a _declaration_ of war as if it were _expressed_ in positive terms.  
To _express_ is to convey to another by any means that which passes in one's mind. To _signify_, from _signum_, a sign, and _facere_, to make, is to convey by some outward sign. To _express_ is said generally of one's opinions and feelings; to _signify_ is to make one's particular wishes known to an individual: we _express_ mostly in positive terms; we may _signify_ in any manner, either by looks or words.  
Words may both _express_ and _signify:_ they _express_ the commonly received meaning affixed to them; but they _signify_ more or less according to circumstances or the intention of the speaker; the word "no" _expresses_ simple negation, but it may be made to _signify_ very differently by any one using it.  
As epithets, _expressive_ and _significant_ admit of a similar distinction: an _expressive_ look is that which is fitted to _express_ what is intended; a _significant_ look is that which is calculated to _signify_ the particular feeling of the individual.  
To _signify_ and _testify_, from _testis_, a witness, and _facere_, to make, like the word _express_, are employed in general for any act of communication otherwise than by words; but _express_ is used in a stronger sense than either of the former. The passions and strongest movements of the soul are _expressed;_ the simple intentions or transitory feelings of the mind are _signified_ or _testified._ A person _expresses_ his joy by the sparkling of his eye and the vivacity of his countenance; he _signifies_ his wish by a nod; he _testifies_ his approbation by a smile. People of vivid sensibility must take care not to _express_ all their feelings; those who expect a ready obedience from their inferiors must not adopt a haughty mode of _signifying_ their will: nothing is more gratifying to an ingenuous mind than to _testify_ its regard for merit, wherever it may discover itself.  
_Utter_, from the preposition _out_, signifying to bring out, differs from _express_ in this, that the latter respects the thing which is communicated, and the former the means of communication. We _express_ from the heart; we _utter_ with the lips: to _express_ an uncharitable sentiment is a violation of Christian duty; to _utter_ an unseemly word is a violation of good manners: those who say what they do not mean _utter_, but not _express;_ those who show by their looks what is passing in their hearts _express_, but do not _utter._

####extend 
**EXTEND, STRETCH, REACH.**  
These words are nearly allied to one another in the sense of drawing out so as to enlarge the dimensions, particularly that of length. _Extend_, from _ex_, out, and _tendere_, to stretch, signifying to tend outward or away from an object, is the most general of these terms. _Stretch_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _strœc_, hard, rigid; _stretch_ being to make stiff or hard, as in straining a string. _Reach_, Anglo-Saxon _rœcan_, conveys the idea of attaining a point or an object by _stretching._ Things may _extend_ in any manner, either by simply passing over or occupying a certain space; as a piece of water _extends_ into a country.  
They may also be _extended_ by adding to their dimensions; as to _extend_ the garden beyond the house.  
Things are _stretched_ or _extended_ lengthwise as far as they will admit of extension; as to _stretch_ one's neck; to he _stretched_ on the ground.  
Wherefore these words may be applied to the same objects with this distinction: to _extend_ the arm or hand is simply to put it out; to _stretch_ the arm is to extend it its full length.  
A country is said to _extend_ in its ordinary application, but it is only said figuratively to _stretch_ when it seems to _extend_ itself by an effort to its utmost length.  
To _extend_ is indefinite as to the distance; it may be shorter or longer, and requires, therefore, to be expressly defined: to _reach_ is defined by the point arrived at, which may be either expressed or implied; as the road _extends_ many miles; it will not _reach_ so far, _i.e._, as the house or other objects implied.  
Persons _extend_ things, as one _extends_ a field, boundary, etc.; persons or things _reach_ things; a person _reaches_ a place; a sound _reaches_ the ear.  
In the moral and extended application they are distinguished in a similar manner: influence, power, observations, etc., may be _extended_ in an indefinite manner as before, but they are said to be _stretched_ when they are carried as far as they can be, and sometimes farther than is convenient.  
One _reaches_ a certain age, or one _reaches_ a goal; the understanding _reaches_ an object of contemplation.

####extenuate 
**EXTENUATE, PALLIATE.**  
_Extenuate_, from the Latin _tenuis_, thin, small, signifies literally to make small. _Palliate_, in Latin _palliatus_, participle of _pallio_, from _pallium_,__ a cloak, signifies to throw a cloak over a thing so that it may not be seen.  
These terms are both applicable to the moral conduct, and express the act of lessening the guilt of any impropriety.  
To _extenuate_ is simply to lessen guilt without reference to the means: to _palliate_ is to lessen it by means of art. To _extenuate_ is rather the effect of circumstances: to _palliate_ is the direct effort of an individual. Ignorance in the offender may serve as an _extenuation_ of his guilt, although not of his offence: it is but a poor _palliation_ of a man's guilt to say that his crimes have not been attended with the mischief which they were calculated to produce.

####extraneous 
**EXTRANEOUS, EXTRINSIC, FOREIGN.**  
_Extraneous_, from _ex_ or _extra_, signifies out of the land, not belonging to it. _Extrinsic_, in Latin _extrinsecus_, compounded of _extra_ and _secus_, beside, signifies outward, external. _Foreign_, from the Latin _foris_, out-of-doors, signifies not belonging to the household.  
The _extraneous_ is that which forms no necessary or natural part of anything: the _extrinsic_ is that which forms a part or has a connection, but only in an indirect form; it is not an inherent or component part: the _foreign_ is that which forms no part whatever and has no kind of connection. A work is said to contain _extraneous_ matter which contains much matter not necessarily belonging to, or illustrative of, the subject: a work is said to have _extrinsic_ merit when it borrows its value from local circumstances, in distinction from the intrinsic merit, or that which lies in the contents.  
_Extraneous_ and _extrinsic_ have a general and abstract sense, but _foreign_ has a particular signification; they always pass over to some object either expressed or understood: hence we say _extraneous_ ideas or _extrinsic_ worth, but that a particular mode of acting is _foreign_ to the general plan pursued. Anecdotes of private individuals would be _extraneous_ matter in a general history: the respect and credit which men gain from their fellow-citizens by an adherence to rectitude is the _extrinsic_ advantage of virtue; the peace of a good conscience and the favor of God are its _intrinsic_ advantages: it is _foreign_ to the purpose of one who is making an abridgment of a work to enter into details in any particular part. 

####extraordinary 
**EXTRAORDINARY, REMARKABLE** are epithets both opposed to the ordinary; and in that sense the _extraordinary_ is that which in its own nature is _remarkable:_ but things, however, may be _extraordinary_ which are not _remarkable_, and the contrary. The _extraordinary_ is that which is out of the ordinary course, but it does not always excite remark, and is not, therefore, _remarkable_, as when we speak of an _extraordinary_ loan, an _extraordinary_ measure of government: on the other hand, when the _extraordinary_ conveys the idea of what deserves notice, it expresses much more than _remarkable._ There are but few _extraordinary_ things; many things are _remarkable:_ the _remarkable_ is eminent; the _extraordinary_ is supereminent: the _extraordinary_ excites our astonishment; the _remarkable_ only awakens our interest and attention. The _extraordinary_ is unexpected; the _remarkable_ is sometimes looked for: every instance of sagacity and fidelity in a dog is _remarkable_, and some _extraordinary_ instances have been related which would almost stagger our belief. 

####extravagant 
**EXTRAVAGANT, PRODIGAL, LAVISH, PROFUSE.**  
_Extravagant_, from _extra_ and _vagans_, participle of _vagari_, to wander, signifies in general wandering from the line; and _prodigal_, from the Latin _prodigus_, from _prod-_, forth, and _agere_, to drive, signifies in general sending forth, or giving out in great quantities. _Lavish_, from Anglo-Saxon _lafian_, to wash, was probably borrowed from Latin _lavare_, to wash, at an early time, signifying to wash away in waste. _Profuse_, from the Latin _profusus_, participle of _profundere_, to pour forth, signifies pouring out freely.  
The idea of using immoderately is implied in all these terms, but _extravagant_ is the most general in its meaning and application. The _extravagant_ man spends his money without reason; the _prodigal_ man spends it in excesses: one may be _extravagant_ with a small sum where it exceeds one's means; one can be _prodigal_ only with large sums.  
_Extravagant_ and _prodigal_ designate habitual as well as particular actions: _lavish_ and _profuse_ are properly applied to particular actions, the former to denote an expenditure more or less wasteful or superfluous, the latter to denote a full supply without any sort of scant. He who is _lavish_ consumes without considering the value of what is spent; but _profuseness_ may sometimes arise from an excess of liberality.  
As _extravagance_ has respect to the disorder of the mind, it may be employed with equal propriety to other objects; as to be _extravagant_ in praises, requests, etc. As _prodigal_ refers to excess in the measure of consumption, it may be applied to other objects than worldly possessions; as to be _prodigal_ of one's time, treasure, strength, and whatever is near and dear to us. _Lavish_ may be applied to any objects which may be dealt out without regard to their value; as to be _lavish_ of one's compliments by scattering them indiscriminately. _Profuse_ may be applied to whatever may be given in superabundance, but mostly in a good or indifferent sense.

_Extremity_ is used in the proper or the improper sense; _extreme_, in the improper sense: we speak of the _extremity_ of a line or an avenue, the _extremity_ of distress, but the _extreme_ of the fashion. In the moral sense, _extremity_ is applicable to the outward circumstances; _extreme_, to the opinions and conduct of men: in matters of dispute between individuals it is a happy thing to guard against coming to _extremities;_ it is the characteristic of volatile tempers to be always in _extremes_, either the _extreme_ of joy or the _extreme_ of sorrow.

####exuberant 
**EXUBERANT, LUXURIANT.**  
_Exuberant_, from the Latin _exuberans_, or _ex_ and _uber_, udder, signifies very fruitful or superabundant: _luxuriant_, in Latin _luxurians_, from _luxus_, pomp, excess, signifies expanding with unrestrained freedom. These terms are both applied to vegetation in a flourishing state; but _exuberance_ expresses the excess, and _luxuriance_ the perfection: in a fertile soil, where plants are left unrestrainedly to themselves, there will be _exuberance;_ plants are to be seen in their _luxuriance_ only in seasons that are favorable to them.  
In the moral application _exuberance_ of intellect is often attended with a restless ambition that is incompatible both with the happiness and advancement of its possessor; _luxuriance_ of imagination is one of the greatest gifts which a poet can boast of.

####fable 
**FABLE, TALE, NOVEL, ROMANCE.**  
_Fable_, in Latin _fabula_, from _fari_, to speak or tell, and _tale_, from to tell, both designate a species of narration; _novel_, from the Italian _novella_, comes from Latin _novellus_, a diminutive of _novus_, new, and signifies news from real life, or simply something new in the way of a story; _romance_ meant a tale in verse, embodying the adventures of some hero of chivalry, written in the vernacular — _i.e._, Italian or Old French — instead of Latin, and derives its name from _Romanicus_, Roman, the general designation of the various Latin dialects, French, Italian, etc., as opposed to classical Latin. Different species of composition are expressed by the above words: the _fable_ is allegorical; its actions are natural, but its agents are imaginary: the _tale_ is fictitious but not imaginary; both the agents and actions are drawn from the passing scenes of life. Gods and goddesses, animals and men, trees, vegetables, and inanimate objects in general may be made the agents of a _fable;_ but of a _tale_, properly speaking, only men or supernatural spirits can be the agents: of the former description are the celebrated _fables_ of Æsop, and of the latter the _tales_ of Marmontel, the _tales_ of the Genii, the Chinese _tales_, etc.: _fables_ are written for instruction, _tales_ principally for amusement: _fables_ consist mostly of only one incident or action, from which a _novel_ may be drawn; _tales_, always of many which excite an interest for an individual.  
The _tale_, when compared with the _novel_, is a simple kind of fiction, and consists of but few persons in the drama; while the _novel_, on the contrary, admits of every possible variety in characters; the _tale_ is told without much art or contrivance to keep the reader in suspense, without any depth of plot or importance in the catastrophe; the _novel_ affords the greatest scope for exciting an interest by the rapid succession of events, the involvements of interest, and the unravelling of its plot. If the _novel_ awakens the attention, the _romance_ rivets the whole mind and engages the affections; it presents nothing but what is extraordinary and calculated to fill the imagination; "of the former description, Cervantes, Le Sage, and Fielding have given us the best specimens; and of the latter we have the best modern specimens from the pen of Mrs. Radcliffe.

####face 
**FACE, FRONT**   
These words figuratively designate the particular parts of bodies which bear some sort of resemblance to the human _face_ or forehead. _Face_ is applied to that part of bodies which serves as an index or rule and contains certain marks to direct the observer; _front_ is employed for that part which is most prominent or foremost: hence we speak of the _face_ of a wheel or clock, the _face_ of a painting, or the _face_ of nature: but the _front_ of a house or building, and the _front_ of a stage: hence, likewise, the propriety of the expressions, to put a good _face_ on a thing, to show a bold _front._  
See also [confront](entry://confront)  
**FACE, COUNTENANCE, VISAGE.** — _Face_, in Latin _fades_, appearance, signifies that which first strikes the attention in the general appearance of another — _i.e._, the _face. Countenance_, in French _contenance_, from the Latin _continere_, to control, meant method of acting or controlling one's self, gestures, demeanor — hence _face. Visage_, from _visus_, sight, look, signifies the particular form of the _face_ as it presents itself to view; properly speaking, a kind of _countenance._ The _face_ consists of a certain set of features; the _countenance_ consists of the general aggregate of looks produced by the mind upon the features; the _visage_ consists of the whole assemblage of features and looks in particular cases: the _face_ is the work of nature; the _countenance_ and _visage_ are the work of the mind: the _face_ remains the same, but the _countenance_ and _visage_ are changeable.  
The _face_ properly belongs to brutes as well as men, the _countenance_ is the peculiar property of man, although sometimes applied to the brutes; the _visage_ is peculiarly applicable to superior beings: the last term is employed only in the grave or lofty style. 

####facetious 
**FACETIOUS, CONVERSABLE, PLEASANT, JOCULAR, JOCOSE.**  
All these epithets designate that companionable quality which consists in liveliness of speech. _Facetious_ was in Latin _facetus_, signifying fine, witty, courteous. _Conversable_ is literally able to hold a conversation. _Pleasant_ (see [agreeable](entry://agreeable)) signifies making ourselves _pleasant_ with others, or them pleased with us. _Jocular_ signifies after the manner of a _joke_, from _joculus_, a little joke; _jocose_, using or having _jokes_, from _iocus_, joke.  
_Facetious_ may be employed either for writing or for conversation; the rest only in conversation: the _facetious_ man deals in that kind of discourse which may excite laughter; a _conversable_ man may instruct as well as amuse; the _pleasant_ man says everything in a _pleasant_ manner; his _pleasantry_ even on the most delicate subject is without offence: the person speaking is _jocose;_ the thing said, or the manner of saying it, is _jocular;_ it is not for any one to be always _jocose_, although sometimes one may assume a _jocular_ air when we are not at liberty to be serious. A man is _facetious_ from humor; he is _conversable_ by means of information; he indulges himself in occasional _pleasantry_, or allows himself to be _jocose_, in order to enliven conversation; a useful hint is sometimes conveyed in _jocular_ terms.

####faction 
**FACTION, PARTY.**  
These two words equally suppose the union of many persons, and their opposition to certain views different from their own: but _faction_, from _factio_, making, denotes an activity and secret machination against those whose views are opposed; and _party_, from the verb to part or split, expresses only a division of opinion.  
The term _party_ has of itself nothing odious; that of _faction_ is always so: any man, without distinction of rank, may have a _party_ either at court or in the army, in the city or in literature, without being himself immediately implicated in raising it; but _factions_ are always the result of active efforts: one may have a _party_ for one's merit, from the number and ardor of one's friends; but a _faction_ is raised by busy and turbulent spirits for their own purposes: Rome was torn by the intestine _factions_ of Cæsar and Pompey. _Faction_ is the demon of discord, armed with the power to do endless mischief, and intent alone on destroying whatever opposes its progress; woe to that state into which it has found an entrance: _party_ spirit may show itself, in noisy debate; but while it keeps within the legitimate bounds of opposition it is an evil that must be endured. 

####factious 
**FACTIOUS, SEDITIOUS.**  
_Factious_, in Latin _factiosus_, from _facere_, to do, signifies the same as busy or intermeddling; ready to take an active part in matters not of one's own immediate concern. _Seditious_, in Latin _seditiosus_, signifies prone to sedition (see [insurrection](entry://insurrection)).  
_Factious_ is an epithet to characterize the tempers of men; _seditious_ characterizes their conduct: the _factious_ man attempts to raise himself into importance, he aims at authority, and seeks to interfere in the measures of government; the _seditious_ man attempts to excite others, and to provoke their resistance to established authority: the first wants to be a lawgiver; the second does not hesitate to be a law-breaker: the first wants to direct the state; the second, to overturn it: the _factious_ man is mostly in possession of either power, rank, or fortune: the _seditious_ man is seldom elevated in station or circumstances above the mass of the people. The Roman tribunes were in general little better than _factious_ demagogues, such, in fact, as abound in all republies; Wat Tyler was a _seditious_ disturber of the peace. _Factious_ is mostly applied to individuals; _seditious_ is employed for bodies of men: hence we speak of a _factious_ nobleman, a _seditious_ multitude. 

####factor 
**FACTOR, AGENT.**  
Though both these terms, according to their origin, imply a maker or doer, yet, at present, they have a distinct signification; the word _factor_ is used in a limited, and the word _agent_ in a general sense: the _factor_ only buys and sells on the account of others; the _agent_ transacts every sort of business in general: merchants and manufacturers employ _factors_ abroad to dispose of goods transmitted; lawyers are frequently employed as _agents_ in the receipt and payment of money, the transfer of estates, and various other pecuniary concerns.

####fail 
**FAIL, FALL SHORT, BE DEFICIENT.**  
_Fail_, in French _faillir_, is derived from the Latin _fallere_, to deceive. To _fail_ marks the result of actions or efforts; a person _fails_ in his undertaking: _fall short_ designates either the result of actions or the state of things; a person _falls short_ in his calculation or in his account; the issue _falls short_ of the expectation: to _be deficient_ marks only the state or quality of objects; a person is _deficient_ in good manners. People frequently _fail_ in their best endeavors for want of knowing how to apply their abilities; when our expectations are immoderate, it is not surprising if our success _falls short_ of our hopes and wishes: there is nothing in which people discover themselves to be more _deficient_ than in keeping ordinary engagements. To _fail_ and _be deficient_ are both applicable to the characters of men; but the former is mostly employed for the moral conduct, the latter for the outward behavior; hence a man is said to _fail_ in his duty, in the discharge of his obligations, in the performance of a promise, and the like: but to _be deficient_ in politeness, in attention to his friends, in his address, in his manner of entering a room, and the like.  
**FAILURE, FAILING.** — _Failure_ bespeaks the action or the result of the action; a _failing_ is the habit or the habitual _failure:_ the former is said of our undertakings, the latter of our moral character. _Failure_ is opposed to success, a _failing_ to a perfection. The merchant must be prepared for _failures_ in his speculations; the statesman for _failures_ in his projects, the result of which depends upon contingencies that are above human control. With our _failings_, however, it is somewhat different; we must never rest satisfied that we are without them, nor contented with the mere consciousness that we have them.  
See also [imperfection](entry://imperfection)  
**FAILURE, MISCARRIAGE, ABORTION.** — _Failure_ has always a reference to the agent and his design; _miscarriage_, that is, the carrying or going wrong, is applicable to all sublunary concerns, without reference to any particular agent; _abortion_, from the Latin _aboriri_, to deviate from the rise, or to pass away before it comes to maturity, is in the proper sense applied to the process of animal nature, and in the figurative sense to the thoughts and designs which are conceived in the mind.  
_Failure_ is more definite in its signification and limited in its application; we speak of the _failures_ of individuals, but of the _miscarriages_ of nations or things: a _failure_ reflects on the person so as to excite toward him some sentiment, either of compassion, displeasure, or the like; a _miscarriage_ is considered mostly in relation to the course of human events: hence the _failure_ of Xerxes's expedition reflected disgrace upon himself; but the _miscarriage_ of military enterprises in general are attributable to the elements or some such untoward circumstance. The _abortion_, in its proper sense, is a species of _miscarriage_, and in application a species of _failure_, as it applies only to the designs of conscious agents; but it does not carry the mind back to the agent, for we speak of the _abortion_ of a scheme with as little reference to the schemer as when we speak of the _miscarriage_ of an expedition.

####faint 
**FAINT, LANGUID.**  
_Faint_ comes from Latin _fingere_, to feign, Old French _feint_, pretended, hence weak; thence developed the general idea of weakness or unreality, to grow _faint_, or to _faint_ meaning to be weak. _Languid_, in Latin _languidus_, from _languere_, is allied to Greek _λαγαρός_, slack, and English _lag. Faint_ is less than _languid; faintness_ is, in fact, in the physical application, the commencement of _languor;_ we may be _faint_ for a short time, and if continued and extended through the limbs it becomes _languor;_ thus we say, to speak with a _faint_ tone, and have a _languid_ frame. In the figurative application, to make a _faint_ resistance, to move with a _languid_ air, to form a _faint_ idea, to make a _languid_ effort. 

####fair 
**FAIR, CLEAR.**  
_Fair_, in Anglo-Saxon _fœger_, beautiful, is allied to Gothic _fagrs_, fit. _Clear_ (for derivation see [clear](entry://clear)).  
_Fair_ is used in a positive sense, _clear_ in a negative sense: there must be some brightness in what is _fair;_ there must be no spots in what is _clear._ The weather is said to be _fair_ which is not only free from what is disagreeable, but somewhat enlivened by the sun; it is _clear_ when it is free from clouds or mists. A _fair_ skin approaches to white; a _clear_ skin is without spots or irregularities.  
In the moral application, a _fair_ fame speaks much in praise of a man; a _clear_ reputation is free from faults. A _fair_ statement contains everything that can be said _pro_ and _con;_ a _clear_ statement is free from ambiguity or obscurity. _Fairness_ is something desirable and inviting; _clearness_ is an absolute requisite, it cannot be dispensed with.  
See also [blonde](entry://blonde)  
**FAIR, HONEST, EQUITABLE, REASONABLE.** — _Fair_ (see above). _Honest_, in Latin _honestus_, comes from _honos_, honor. _Equitable_ signifies having _equity_, or according to _equity_, from Latin _œquus_, equal. _Reasonable_ signifies having _reason_, or according to _reason. Fair_ is said of persons or things; _honesty_ mostly characterizes the person, either as to his conduct or his principle. When _fair_ and _honest_ are both applied to the external conduct, the former expresses more than the latter: a man may be _honest_ without being _fair;_ he cannot be _fair_ without being _honest. Fairness_ enters into every minute circumstance connected with the interests of the parties, and weighs them alike for both; _honesty_ is contented with a liberal conformity to the law, it consults the interest of one party; the _fair_ dealer looks to his neighbor as well as himself, he. wishes only for an equal share of advantage; a man may be an _honest_ dealer while he looks to no one's advantage but his own: the _fair_ man always acts from a principle of right; the _honest_ man may be so from a motive of fear.  
When _fair_ is employed as an epithet to qualify things, or to designate their nature, it approaches very near in signification to _equitable_ and _reasonable;_ they are all opposed to what is unjust: _fair_ and _equitable_ suppose two objects put in collision; _reasonable_ is employed abstractly; what is _fair_ and _equitable_ is so in relation to all circumstances, what is _reasonable_ is so of itself. An estimate _is fair_ in which profit and loss, merit and demerit, with every collateral circumstance, is duly weighed; a judgment is _equitable_ which decides suitably and advantageously for both parties; a price is _reasonable_ which does not exceed the limits of reason or propriety. A decision may be either _fair_ or _equitable;_ but the former is said mostly in regard to trifling matters, even in our games and amusements, and the latter in regard to the important rights of mankind. It is the business of the umpire to decide _fairly_ between the combatants or the competitors for a prize; it is the business of the judge to decide _equitably_ between men whose property is at issue. A demand, a charge, a proposition, or an offer may be said to be either _fair_ or _reasonable;_ but the former term always bears a relation to what is right between man and man; the latter, to what is right in itself according to circumstances. 

####faith 
**FAITH, CREED.**  
_Faith_ (see [belief](entry://belief)) denotes either the principle of trusting or the thing trusted. _Creed_, from the Latin _credere_, to believe, denotes the thing believed.  
These words are synonymous when taken for the thing trusted in or believed; but they differ in this, that _faith_ has always a reference to the principle in the mind; _creed_ only respects the thing which is the object of _faith: faith_ is the general and _creed_ the particular term, for a _creed_ is a set form of _faith:_ hence we say to be of the same _faith_, or to adopt the same _creed._ The holy martyrs died for the _faith_ as it is in Christ Jesus; every established form of religion will have its peculiar _creed._ The Church of England has adopted that _creed_ which it considers as containing the purest principles of Christian _faith._   
**FAITH, FIDELITY.** — Though derived from the same source, they differ widely in meaning: _faith_ here denotes a mode of action, namely, in acting true to the _faith_ which others repose in us; _fidelity_, a disposition of the mind to adhere to that _faith_ which others repose in us. We keep _our faith_, we show our _fidelity. Faith_ is a public concern, it depends on promises; _fidelity_ is a private or personal concern, it depends upon relationships and connections. A breach of _faith_ is a crime that brings a stain on a nation, for _faith_ ought to be kept even with an enemy. A breach of _fidelity_ attaches disgrace to the individual, for _fidelity_ is due from a subject to a prince, or from a servant to his master, or from married people one to another. No treaty can be made with him who will keep no _faith;_ no confidence can be placed in him who discovers no _fidelity._  
**FAITHFUL, TRUSTY.** — _Faithful_ signifies full of _faith_ or _fidelity. Trusty_ signifies fit or worthy to be _trusted. Faithful_ respects the principle altogether; it is suited to all relations and stations, public and private; _trusty_ includes not only the principle, but the mental qualifications in general; it applies to those in whom particular _trust_ is to be placed. It is the part of a Christian to be _faithful_ to all his engagements; it is a particular excellence in a servant to be _trusty. Faithful_ is applied in the improper sense to an unconscious _agent; trusty_ may be applied with equal propriety to things as to persons. We may speak of a _faithful_ saying or a _faithful_ picture; a _trusty_ sword or a _trusty_ weapon.  
In the United States the term _trusty_ has of late come to apply to an inmate of an institution for the insane whose condition has so far improved that he or she is relieved of ordinary restraint and is permitted to go about the grounds and vicinity; to a prisoner whose conduct has won for him a relaxation of rules and permission to go beyond the prison walls without a guard; and to one committed to a correctional institution who is allowed similar privileges.  
**FAITHLESS, UNFAITHFUL.** — _Faithless is_ mostly employed to denote a breach of _faith_, and _unfaithful_ to mark the want of _fidelity._ The former is positive; the latter is rather negative, implying a deficiency. A prince, a government, a people, or an individual is said to be _faithless;_ a husband, a wife, a servant, or any individual, _unfaithful._ Mettus Fuffetius, the Alban Dictator, was _faithless_ to the Roman people when he withheld his assistance in the battle and strove to go over to the enemy: a man is _unfaithful_ to his employer who sees him injured by others without doing his utmost to prevent it. A woman is _faithless_ to her husband who breaks the marriage vow; she is _unfaithful_ to him when she does not discharge the duties of a wife to the best of her abilities.  
**FAITHLESS, PERFIDIOUS, TREACHEROUS.** — _Faithless_ is the generic term, the rest are specific terms; a breach of good _faith_ is expressed by them all, but _faithless_ expresses no more: the others include accessory ideas in their signification. _Perfidious_, in Latin _perfidiosus_, signifies literally breaking through _faith_ in a great degree, and now implies the addition of hostility to the breach of _faith. Treacherous_ is derived from Old French _trechier_, to trick, Latin _tricare_, from _tricœ_, difficulties, wiles, and is allied to _intricate_, etc.  
A _faithless_ man is _faithless_ only for his own interest; a _perfidious_ man is expressly so to the injury of another. A friend is _faithless_ who consults his own safety in time of need; he is _perfidious_ if he profits by the confidence reposed in him to plot mischief against the one to whom he has made vows of friendship. _Faithlessness_ does not suppose any particular efforts to deceive: it consists of merely violating that _faith_ which the relation produces; _perfidy_ is never so complete as when it has most effectually assumed the mask of sincerity.  
_Perfidy_ may lie in the will to do; _treachery_ lies altogether in the thing done; one may therefore be _perfidious_ without being _treacherous._ A friend is _perfidious_ whenever he evinces his _perfidy;_ but he is said to be _treacherous_ only in the particular instance in which he betrays the confidence and interests of another. I detect a man's _perfidy_, or his _perfidious_ aims, by the manner in which he attempts to draw my secrets from me; I am not made acquainted with his _treachery_ until I discover that my confidence is betrayed and my secrets are divulged. On the other hand, we may be _treacherous_ without being _perfidious. Perfidy_ is an offence mostly between individuals; it is rather a breach of fidelity (see [faith](entry://faith)) than of faith; _treachery_, on the other hand, includes breaches of private or public faith. A servant may be both _perfidious_ and _treacherous_ to his master; a citizen may be _treacherous_, but not _perfidious_, toward his country. It is said that in the South Sea Islands, when a chief wants a human victim, their officers will sometimes invite their friends or relations to come to them, when they take the opportunity of suddenly falling upon them and despatching them; here is _perfidy_ in the individual who acts this false part, and _treachery_ in the act of betraying him who is murdered. When the school-master of Falerii delivered his scholars to Camillus, he was guilty of _treachery_ in the act and of _perfidy_ toward those who had reposed confidence in him. When Romulus ordered the Sabine women to be seized, it was an act of _treachery_, but not of _perfidy;_ so, in like manner, when the daughter of Tarpeius opened the gates of the Roman citadel to the enemy. 

####fall 
**FALL, DOWNFALL, RUIN.**  
_Fall_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _feallan_, possibly allied to Latin _fallere_, to deceive. _Ruin_ (see [destruction](entry://destruction)).  
Whether applied to physical objects or the condition of persons, _fall_ expresses less than _downfall_, and this less than _ruin. Fall_ applies to that which is erect; _downfall_, to that which is elevated: everything which is set up, although as trifling as a stick, may have a _fall;_ but we speak of the _downfall_ of the loftiest trees or the tallest spires. A _fall_ may be attended with more or less mischief, or even with none at all; but _downfall_ and _ruin_ are accompanied with the dissolution of the bodies that _fall._ The higher a body is raised, and the greater the art that is employed in the structure, the completer the _downfall;_ the greater the structure the more extended the _ruin._ In the figurative application we may speak of the _fall_ of man from a state of innocence, a state of ease, or a state of prosperity, or his _downfall_ from greatness or high rank. He may recover from his _fall_, but his _downfall_ is commonly followed by the entire _ruin_ of his concerns, and often of himself. The _fall_ of kingdoms and the _downfall_ of empires must always be succeeded by their _ruin_ as an inevitable result.  
**FALL, DROP, DROOP, SINK, TUMBLE.** — _Fall_ (see above). _Drop_ and _droop_ were originally the same word, _drop_ being the Anglo-Saxon form, and _droop_ the Scandinavian form. _Sink_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _sincan_, to sink. _Tumble_ is in Anglo-Saxon _tumbian_, meaning to turn heels over head, allied to Old High German _tumon_, to turn over and over, whence French _tomber_, to fall, is derived.  
_Fall_ is the generic, the rest specific terms: to _drop_ is to _fall_ suddenly, and mostly in the form of a drop; to _droop_ is to _drop_ in part; to _sink_ is to _fall_ gradually; to _tumble_ is to _fall_ awkwardly or contrary to the usual mode. In cataracts the water _falls_ perpetually and in a mass: in rain it _drops_ partially; in ponds the water _sinks_ low. The head _droops_, but the body may _fall_ or _drop_ from a height, it may _sink_ down to the earth, it may _tumble_ by accident.  
_Fall, drop_, and _sink_ are extended in their application to moral or other objects; _droop_ and _tumble_, in the physical sense. A person _falls_ from a state of prosperity; words _drop_ from the hps and _sink_ into the heart. Com, or the price of corn, _falls;_ a subject _drops;_ a person _sinks_ into poverty or in the estimation of the world. 

####fallacious 
**FALLACIOUS, DECEITFUL, FRAUDULENT.**  
_Fallacious_ comes from the Latin _fallax_ and _fallere_, to deceive, signifying the property of misleading. _Deceitful_ (see [deceive](entry://deceive)). _Fraudulent_ signifies after the manner of a _fraud._  
The _fallacious_ has respect to falsehood in opinion; _deceitful_ to that which is externally false: our hopes are often _fallacious;_ the appearances of things are often _deceitful. Fallacious_, as characteristic of the mind, excludes the idea of design; _deceitful_ excludes the idea of mistake; _fraudulent_ is a gross species of the _deceitful._ It is a _fallacious_ idea for any one to imagine that the faults of others can serve as any extenuation of his own; it is a _deceitful_ mode of acting for any one to advise another to do that which he would not do himself; it is _fraudulent_ to attempt to get money by means of a falsehood.  
**FALLACY, DELUSION, ILLUSION.** — The _fallacy_ is that which has the tendency to deceive; the _delusion_ is that which deludes, or the state of being _deluded;_ the _illusion_ is that which has the power of illuding or sporting with the mind, or the state of being so played upon. We endeavor to detect the _fallacy_ which lies concealed in a proposition: we endeavor to remove the _delusion_ to which the judgment has been exposed, and to dissipate the _illusion_ to which the senses or fancy are liable.  
In all the reasonings of freethinkers there are _fallacies_ against which the ignorant cannot always be on their guard. The ignorant are perpetually exposed to _delusions_ when they attempt to speculate on matters of opinion. The ideas of ghosts and apparitions are mostly attributable to the _illusions_ of the senses and the imagination.

####fame 
**FAME, REPUTATION, RENOWN.**  
_Fame_ (from Latin _fari_, to speak) is the most noisy and uncertain; it rests upon report: _reputation_ (see [character](entry://character)) is silent and solid; it lies more in the thoughts and is derived from observation. _Renown_, in French _renommée_, from Latin _re_, again, and _nomen_, name, meaning named again and again, signifies the reverberation of a name; it is as loud as _fame_, but more substantial and better founded: hence we say that a person's _fame_ is gone abroad, his _reputation_ is established, and he has got _renown. Fame_ may be applied to any object, good, bad, or indifferent; _reputation_ is applied only to real eminence in some department; _renown_ is employed only for extraordinary men and brilliant exploits. The _fame_ of a quack may be spread among the ignorant multitude by means of a lucky cure; the _reputation_ of a physician rests upon his tried skill and known experience; the _renown_ of a general is proportioned to the magnitude of his achievements.  
**FAME, REPORT, RUMOR, HEARSAY.** — _Fame_ has a reference to the thing which gives birth to it; it goes about of itself without any apparent instrumentality. _Report_ (from _re_ and _portare_, to carry back, or away from an object) has always a reference to the _reporter. Rumor_, in Latin _rumor_, from a root which signifies to make a humming noise, has a reference to the buzzing nature of words that are carried; it is therefore properly a buzzing _report. Hearsay_ refers to the receiver of that which is said: it is limited, therefore, to a small number of speakers or reporters. _Fame_ serves to form or establish a character either of a person or a thing; it will be good or bad, according to circumstances; the _fame_ of our Saviour's miracles went abroad through the land; a _report_ serves to communicate information of events; it may be more or less correct according to the veracity or authenticity of the _reporter; reports_ of victories mostly precede the official confirmation: a _rumor_ serves the purposes of fiction; it is more or less vague, according to the temper of the times and the nature of the events; every battle gives rise to a thousand _rumors:_ the _hearsay_ serves for information or instruction, and is seldom so incorrect as it is familiar. 

####familiar

####familiarity 
See [acquaintance](entry://acquaintance)

####family 
**FAMILY, HOUSE, LINEAGE, RACE.**  
Divisions of men, according to some rule of relationship or connection, is the common idea in these terms. _Family_ is the most general in its import (from the Latin _familia_, a family, _famulus_, a servant). It is applicable to those who are bound together upon the principle of dependence. _House_ figuratively denotes those who live in the same _house_ (Anglo-Saxon _hus_, German _haus_, possibly from a root meaning to hide), and is commonly extended in its signification to all that passes under the same roof: hence we rather say that a woman manages her _family;_ that a man rules his _house._ The _family_ is considered as to its relationships — the number, union, condition, and quality of its members: the _house_ is considered more as to what is transacted within its walls. We speak of a numerous _family_, a united or affectionate _family;_ a mercantile _house_, and _the House_, meaning the members of the _House_ of Parliament or _House_ of Representatives, sometimes called the _Lower House_ to distinguish it from the _House_ of Lords or the Senate, familiarly called the _Upper House._ If a man cannot find happiness in the bosom of his _family_, he will seek for it in vain elsewhere; the credit of a _house_ is to be kept up only by prompt payments.  
In an extended application of these words they are made to designate the quality of the individual, in which case _family_ bears the same familiar and indiscriminate sense as before: _house_ is employed as a term of grandeur. When we consider the _family_ in its domestic relations, in its habits, manners, connections, and circumstances, we speak of a genteel _family_, a respectable _family_, the royal _family:_ but when we consider it with regard to its political and civil distinctions, its titles and its power, then we denominate it a _house_, as an illustrious _house;_ the _House_ of Bourbon, of Brunswick, or of Hanover; the imperial _House_ of Austria. Any subject may belong to an ancient or noble _family:_ princes are said to be descended from ancient _houses._ A man is said to be of _family_ or of no _family:_ we may say likewise that he is of a certain _house;_ but to say that he is of no _house_ would be superfluous. In republics there are _families_, but not _houses_, because there is no nobility; in China, likewise, where the private virtues only distinguish the individual or his _family_, the term _house_ is altogether inapplicable.  
_Family_ includes in it every circumstance of connection and relationship; _lineage_ respects only consanguinity: _family_ is employed mostly for those who are coeval; _lineage_ is generally used for those who have gone before. When the Athenian general Iphicrates, son of a shoemaker, was reproached by Harmodius with his birth, he said, I had rather be the first than the last of my _family:_ David was of the _lineage_ of Abraham, and our Saviour was of the _lineage_ of David. _Race_, from the Latin _radix_, a root, denotes the origin, or that which constitutes the original point of resemblance. A _family_ sup-pose's the closest alliance; a _race_ supposes no closer connection than what a common property creates. _Family_ is confined to a comparatively small number; _race is_ a term of extensive import, including all mankind, as the human _race_, or particular nations, as the _race_ of South Sea Islanders; or a particular _family_, as the _race_ of the Heraclides: from Hercules sprang a _race_ of heroes. 

####famous 
**FAMOUS, CELEBRATED, RENOWNED, ILLUSTRIOUS.**  
_Famous_ signifies literally having _fame_ or the cause of _fame;_ it is applicable to that which causes a noise or sensation; to that which is talked of, written upon, discussed, and thought of; to that which is reported of far and near; to that which is circulated among all ranks and orders of men. _Celebrated_ signifies literally kept in the memory by a _celebration_ or memorial, and is applicable to that which is praised and honored with solemnity. _Renowned_ signifies literally possessed of a name, and is applicable to whatever extends the name or causes the name to be often repeated. _Illustrious_ signifies literally what has or gives a lustre: it is applicable to whatever confers dignity.  
_Famous_ is a term of indefinite import; it conveys of itself frequently neither honor nor dishonor, since it is employed indifferently as an epithet for things praiseworthy or otherwise; it is the only one of these terms which may be used in a bad sense. The others rise in a gradually good sense. The _celebrated_ is founded upon merit, and the display of talent in the arts and sciences; it gains the subject respect: the _renowned_ is founded upon the possession of rare or extraordinary qualities, upon successful exertions and an accordance with public opinion; it brings great honor or glory to the subject: the _illustrious_ is founded upon those solid qualities which not only render one known, but distinguished; it insures regard and veneration. A person may be _famous_ for his eccentricities; _celebrated_ as an artist, a writer, or a player; _renowned_ as a warrior or a statesman; _illustrious_ as a prince, a statesman, or a senator. The Maid of Orleans, who was decried by the English and idolized by the French, is equally _famous_ in both nations. There are _celebrated_ authors whom to censure, even in that which is censurable, would endanger one's reputation. The _renowned_ heroes of antiquity have, by the perusal of their exploits, given birth to a race of modern heroes not inferior to themselves. Princes may shine in their lifetime, but they cannot render themselves _illustrious_ to posterity except by the monuments of goodness and wisdom which they leave after them. 

####fanatic 
See [enthusiast](entry://enthusiast)

####fanciful 
**FANCIFUL, FANTASTICAL, WHIMSICAL, CAPRICIOUS.**  
_Fanciful_ signifies full of _fancy_ (see [conceit](entry://conceit)). _Fantastical_ signifies belonging to the fantasy, which is the immediate derivative from the Greek _φαντασία_, Latin _fantasia_, a vision, from root meaning to shine. _Whimsical_ signifies either like a whim or having a whim, from a Scandinavian word meaning freak. _Capricious_ means having _caprice. Fanciful_ and _fantastical_ are both employed for persons and things; _whimsical_ and _capricious_ are mostly employed for persons, or what is personal. _Fanciful_ is said of that which is irregular in the taste or judgment; _fantastical_ is said of that which violates all propriety as well as regularity: the former may consist of a simple deviation from rule; the latter is something extravagant. A person may, therefore, sometimes be advantageously _fanciful_, although he can never be _fantastical_ but to his discredit. Lively minds will be _fanciful_ in the choice of their dress, furniture, or equipage: the affectation of singularity frequently renders people _fantastical_ in their manners as well as their dress.  
_Fanciful_ is said mostly in regard to errors of opinion or taste; it springs from an aberration of the mind: _whimsical_ is a species of the _fanciful_ in regard to one's likes or dislikes; _capricious_ respects errors of temper or irregularities of feeling. The _fanciful_ does not necessarily imply instability; but the _capricious_ excludes the idea of fixedness. One is _fanciful_ by attaching a reality to that which only passes in one's own mind; one is _whimsical_ in the inventions of the _fancy;_ one is _capricious_ by acting and judging without rule or reason that which admits of both. See also [utopian](entry://utopian)  
**FANCY, IMAGINATION.** — From what has already been said the distinction between _fancy_ and _imagination_ as operations of thought, will be obvious. _Fancy_, considered as a power, simply brings the object to the mind or makes it appear; but _imagination_, from _image_, in Latin _imago_, from the root found in _imitari_, English _imitate_, is a power which presents the images or likenesses of things. The _fancy_, therefore, only employs itself about things without regarding their nature; but the _imagination_ aims at tracing a resemblance and getting a true copy. The _fancy_ consequently forms combinations, either real or unreal, as chance may direct; but the _imagination_ is seldomer led astray. The _fancy_ is busy in dreams or when the mind is in a disordered state; but the _imagination_ is supposed to act when the intellectual powers are in full play.  
The _fancy_ is employed on light and trivial objects which are present to the senses; the _imagination_ soars above all vulgar objects and carries us from the world of matter into the world of spirits, from time present to the time to come.  
A milliner or mantua-maker may employ her _fancy_ in the decorations of a cap or gown; but the poet's _imagination_ depicts everything grand, everything bold, and everything remote.  
Although Mr. Addison has thought proper, for his convenience, to use the words _fancy_ and _imagination_ promiscuously when writing on this subject, yet the distinction, as above pointed out, has been observed both in familiar discourse and in writing. We say that we _fancy_, not that we _imagine_, that we see or hear something; the pleasures of the _imagination_, not of the _fancy._

####farcical 
**FARCICAL, COMIC.**  
_Farcical_, the adjective of _farce_ (in French the same form, from _farcer_, to stuff, Latin _farcio_, Italian _farso)_, signifies, literally, the stuffing in meat, and, in ordinary language, whatever pertains to a farce, anything stuffed with foreign matters, specifically a dramatic piece of a humorous character, full of exaggeration and drollery; hence, anything absurdly exaggerated.  
_Farce_ differs from _comedy_ proper in degree, but not in kind. The aim of both is to excite mirth, but while the _comedy_ does so by a comparatively faithful adherence to nature and truth, the _farce_ takes much greater license and does not scruple to make use of any extravagance or improbability that may serve its purpose. At one time a _farce_ was a petty show exhibited in the streets, then it was a short after-piece on the stage following a more serious performance, and latterly it supplied the entire performance. 

####fare 
**FARE, PROVISION.**  
_Fare_, from Anglo-Saxon _faran_, to go, signifies in general the condition or thing that comes to one or is provided for a journey. _Provision_, from _provide_, signifies the thing provided for one.  
These terms are alike employed for the ordinary concerns of life, and may either be used in the limited sense for the food one procures or in general for whatever necessity or convenience is procured: to the term _fare_ is annexed the idea of accident; _provision_ includes that of design: a traveller on the Continent must frequently be contented with humble _fare_, unless he takes the precaution of carrying his _provisions_ with him. 

####farmer 
**FARMER, HUSBANDMAN, AGRICULTURIST.**  
_Farmer_ comes from Anglo-French _ferme_, Late Latin _firma_, from _firmus_, a fixed rent, a farmer being one who paid a fixed rent to a landlord; _husbandman_ is one following _husbandry,_ that is, the tillage of land by manual labor; the _farmer_, therefore, conducts the concern, and the _husbandman_ labors under his direction: _agriculturist_, from the Latin _ager_, a field, and _colere_, to till, signifies any one engaged in the art of cultivation. The _farmer_ is always a practitioner; the _agriculturist_ may be a mere theorist: the _farmer_ follows _husbandry_ solely as a means of living: the _agriculturist_ follows it as a science; the former tills the land upon given admitted principles; the latter frames new principles or alters those that are established. Between the _farmer_ and the _agriculturist_ there is the same difference as between practice and theory: the former may be assisted by the latter so long as they can go hand in hand; but in the case of a collision the _farmer_ will be of more service to himself and his country than the _agriculturist; farming_ brings immediate profit from personal service; _agriculture_ may only promise future, and consequently contingent, advantages.  
_Husbandman_ is now obsolete in prose, though it is still used in poetry.

####fashion 
**FASHION, QUALITY, DISTINCTION.**  
These epithets are employed promiscuously in colloquial discourse, but not with strict propriety: by men _of fashion_ are understood such men as live in the fashionable world and keep the best company; by men _of quality_ are understood men of rank or title; by men _of distinction_ are understood men of honorable superiority, whether by wealth, office, or pre-eminence in society. Gentry and merchants, though not men _of quality_, may, by their mode of living, be men _of fashion;_ and by the office they hold in the state they may likewise be men _of distinction._

####fastidious 
**FASTIDIOUS, SQUEAMISH.**  
_Fastidious_ comes from Latin _fastidium_, loathing, perhaps from _fastus_, arrogance, and _tœdium_, disgust, _fastidium_ meaning arrogant disgust; _squeamish_ is in Middle English _skeymous_, disdainful, from Anglo-French _escoymous_, delicate, nice as to food, from Greek _σχήμα_, English _scheme_, meaning form, air, mien, manners — hence literally full of airs; in a moral sense it signifies foolishly sickly, easily disgusted. _Squeamish_ implies a stronger physical shrinking than _fastidious._ The _fastidious_ man avoids or rejects what he does not like; a _squeamish_ person reacts more obviously against it with a kind of nervous horror. Whoever examines his own imperfections will cease to be _fastidious;_ whoever restrains humor and caprice will cease to be _squeamish._

####fatigue 
**FATIGUE, WEARINESS, LASSITUDE.**  
_Fatigue_, from the Latin _fatigare_, possibly from a root meaning to yawn, is the Latin word corresponding to the English _weariness. Weariness_ is the substantive corresponding to _weary_, Anglo-Saxon _werig_, from _worian_, to tramp about in a swampy place, from _wor_, swamp; hence the state of feeling produced by walking over swampy ground. _Lassitude_, from the Latin _lassus_, weary, marks a state without specifying a cause.  
_Fatigue_ is an exhaustion of the animal or mental powers; _weariness_ is a wearing out the strength or breaking the spirits; _lassitude_ is a general relaxation of the animal frame: the laborer experiences _fatigue_ from the toils of the day; the man of business, who is harassed by the multiplicity and complexity of his concerns, suffers _fatigue;_ and the student who labors to fit himself for a public exhibition of his acquirements is in like manner exposed to _fatigue: weariness_ attends the traveller who takes a long or pathless journey; _weariness_ is the lot of the petitioner who attends in the antechamber of a great man; the critic is doomed to suffer _weariness_ who is obliged to drag through the shallow but voluminous writings of a dull author. _Lassitude_ is the consequence of a distempered system, sometimes brought on by an excess of _fatigue_, sometimes by sickness, and frequently by the action of the external air.

####favorable 
**FAVORABLE, PROPITIOUS.**  
In a former paragraph (see [auspicious](entry://auspicious)) I have shown _propitious_ to be a species of the _favorable_, namely, the _favorable_ as it springs from the design of an agent; what is _propitious_, therefore, is always _favorable_, but not _vice versa:_ the _favorable_ properly characterizes both persons and things; the _propitious_, in the proper sense, characterizes the person only: as applied to persons, an equal may be _favorable;_ a superior only is _propitious:_ the one may be _favorable_ only in inclination; the latter is _favorable_ also in granting timely assistance. Cato was _favorable_ to Pompey; the gods were _propitious_ to the Greeks: we may all wish to have our friends _favorable_ to our projects; none but heathens expect to have a blind destiny _propitious._ In the improper sense, _propitious_ may be applied to things with a similar distinction: whatever is well disposed to us, and seconds our endeavors, or serves our purpose, is _favorable;_ whatever efficaciously protects us, speeds our exertions, and decides our success is _propitious_ to us: on ordinary occasions, a wind is said to be _favorable_ which carries us to the end of our voyage; but it is said to be _propitious_ if the rapidity of our passage forwards any great purpose of our own.

####fearful 
**FEARFUL, DREADFUL, FRIGHTFUL, TREMENDOUS, TERRIBLE, TERRIFIC, HORRIBLE, HORRID.**  
_Fearful_ here signifies full of that which causes _fear_ (see [alarm](entry://alarm)); _dreadful_, full of what causes _dread_ (see [apprehension](entry://apprehension)); _frightful_, full of what causes _fright_ (see [afraid](entry://afraid)); _tremendous_, that which causes _trembling; terrible_ or _terrific_, causing _terror; horrible_ or _horrid_, causing _horror._ The application of these terms is easily to be discovered by these definitions: the first two affect the mind more than the senses; all the others affect the senses more than the mind: a contest is _fearful_ when the issue is important but the event doubtful; the thought of death is _dreadful_ to one who feels himself unprepared. The _frightful_ is less than the _tremendous_, the _tremendous_ than the _terrible_, the _terrible_ than the _horrible:_ shrieks may be _frightful;_ thunder and lightning may be _tremendous;_ the roaring of a lion is _terrible;_ the glare of his eye _terrific;_ the actual spectacle of killing is _horrible_ or _horrid._ In their general application these terms are often employed promiscuously to characterize whatever produces very strong impressions: hence we may speak of a _frightful, dreadful, terrible_, or _horrid_ dream; or _frightful, dreadful_, or _terrible_ tempest; _dreadful, terrible_, or _horrid_ consequences.

####feast 
**FEAST, BANQUET, CAROUSAL, ENTERTAINMENT, TREAT.**  
As _feasts_, in the religious sense, being derived from _festus_, joyful, are always days of leisure and frequently of public rejoicing, this word has been applied to any social meal for the purposes of pleasure: this is the idea common to the signification of all these words, of which _feast_ seems to be the most general; and for all of which it may frequently be substituted, although they have each a distinct application: _feast_ conveys the idea merely of enjoyment: _banquet_ is a splendid _feast_, attended with pomp and state; it is a term of noble use, particularly adapted to poetry and the high style: _carousal_, French _carous_, from the German _garaus_ (from _gar_, entirely, and _aus_, out), means the emptying out of the glass, a drinking-bout; _entertainment_ and _treat_ convey the idea of hospitality.  
_Feast, entertainment_, and _treat_ are taken in a more extended sense, to express other pleasures besides those of the table: _feast_ retains its signification of a vivid pleasure, such as voluptuaries derive from delicious viands; _entertainment_ and _treat_ retain the idea of being granted by way of courtesy: we speak of a thing as being a _feast_ or high delight; and of a person contributing to one's _entertainment_, or giving one a _treat._ To a benevolent mind the spectacle of an afflicted man relieved and comforted is a _feast;_ to a mind ardent in the pursuit of knowledge, an easy access to a well-stocked library is a continued _feast:_ men of a happy temper give and receive _entertainment_ with equal facility; they afford _entertainment_ to their guests by the easy cheerfulness which they impart to everything around them; they in like manner derive _entertainment_ from everything they see or hear or observe: a _treat_ is given or received only on particular occasions; it depends on the relative circumstances and tastes of the giver and receiver; to one of a musical turn one may give a _treat_ by inviting him to a musical party; and to one of an intelligent turn it will be equally a _treat_ to be of the party which consists of the enlightened and conversable.  
**FEAST, FESTIVAL, HOLIDAY.** — _Feast_, in Latin _festum_, or _festus_, changed most probably from _fesiœ_ and _feriœ_, which latter, in all probability, comes from the Greek _ίέρεια_, sacred, because these days were kept sacred or vacant from all secular labor: _festival_ and _holiday_, as the words themselves denote, have precisely the same meaning in their original sense, with this difference, that the former derives its origin from heathenish superstition, the latter owes its rise to the establishment of Christianity in its reformed state.  
A _feast_, in the Christian sense of the word, is applied to every day which is regarded as sacred and observed with particular solemnity, except Sundays; a _holyday_, or, according to its modern orthography, a _holiday_, is simply a day on which ordinary business is suspended: among the Roman Catholics there are many days which are kept holy, and consequently by them denominated _feasts_, which in the English reformed church are only observed as _holidays_, or days of exemption from public business; of this description are the saints' days, on which the public offices are shut: on the other hand, Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide are regarded in both churches more as _feasts_ than as _holidays._ There are, therefore, many _feasts_ where there are no _holidays_, and many _holidays_ where there are no _feasts._ A _feast_ is altogether sacred; a _holiday_ has frequently nothing sacred in it, not even in its cause; it may be a simple ordinary transaction, the act of an individual: a_ festival_ has always either a sacred or a serious object. A _feast_ is kept by religious worship; a _holiday_ is kept by idleness; a _festival_ is kept by mirth and festivity: some _feasts axe festivals_, as in the case of the carnival at Rome; some _festivals_ are _holidays_, as in the case of weddings and public thanksgivings.

####feel 
**FEEL, BE SENSIBLE, CONSCIOUS.**  
From the simple idea of a sense, the word _feel_ has acquired the most extensive signification and application in our language, and may be employed indifferently for all the other terms, but not in all cases: to _feel_ is said of the whole frame, inwardly and outwardly; it is the accompaniment of existence: to _be sensible_, from the Latin _sentio_, is said only of the senses. It is the property of all living creatures to _feel_ pleasure and pain in a greater or less degree: those creatures which have not the sense of hearing will not _be sensible_ of sounds. In the moral application, to _feel_ is peculiarly the property or act of the heart; to _be sensible_ is that of the understanding: an ingenuous mind _feels_ pain when it is _sensible_ of having committed an error: one may, however, _feel_ as well as _be sensible_ by means of the understanding: a person _feels_ the value of another's service; is _sensible_ of his kindness: one _feels_ or is _sensible_ of what passes outwardly; one is _conscious_ only of what passes inwardly, from _con_ or _cum_ and _scio_, to know to one's self: we feel the force of another's remark; we are _sensible_ of the evil which must spring from the practice of vice; we are _conscious_ of having fallen short of our duty.  
**FEELING, SENSE, SENSATION.** — _Feeling_, from Anglo-Saxon _felan_, is allied to Anglo-Saxon _folm_, the palm of the hand — the hand being that with which one _feels. Sensation_ is taken only in a particular sense. _Feeling_ and _sense_ are either physical or moral properties; _sensation_ is a particular act of physical or moral feeling.  
_Feeling_, physically considered, is but a mode of _sense;_ anatomists reckon five _senses_, of which _feeling_ is one: _sense_ is the abstract faculty of perceiving through the medium of the sense, as to be deprived of _sense_ when stunned by a blow; to be without _sense_ when divested of the ordinary faculties. As all creatures which have life have _feeling_, the expression, creatures without _feeling_, may be applied to inanimate objects; but in general the term _feeling_ is taken for the sense of _feeling. Feeling_, in its limited acceptation, is either a state of _feeling_ or an act of _feeling: sense_ is a mode of sense, _i.e._, a mode of perceiving through the medium of any particular organ of sense, or a state of perceiving particular objects. In this acceptation _feeling_ is applied to moral as well as physical objects, sense, to intellectual as well as sensible objects: _feeling_ has its seat in the heart, _sense_ in the understanding; _feeling_ is transitory and fluctuating, _sense_ is permanent and regular. There _are feelings_ of love, charity, compassion, etc.; there is a _sense_ of justice, rectitude, propriety, etc.  
As the _sensation_ denotes a particular act of _feeling_, it differs from _feeling_ only in application: the term _feeling_ is most adapted to ordinary discourse on familiar matters; _sensation_, to the grave and scientific style: a child may talk of an unpleasant or pleasant _feeling_, a _feeling_ of cold or hunger; the professional man talks of the _sensation_ of giddiness, a gnawing _sensation_, and the like.  
**FEELING, SENSIBILITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY.** — _Feeling_, in the present case, is taken for a positive characteristic, namely, the property of _feeling_ in a strong degree; in this sense _feeling_ expresses either a particular act or a habitual property of the mind. _Sensibility_ is always taken in the sense of a habit. Traits of _feeling_ in young people are happy omens in the estimation of the preceptor: an exquisite _sensibility_ is not a desirable gift; it creates an infinite disproportion of pain. _Feeling_ and _sensibility_ are here taken as moral properties, which are awakened as much by the operations of the mind within itself as by external objects: _susceptibility_, from the Latin _suscipere_ and _capere_, to take, designates that property of the body or the mind which consists in being ready to be influenced by external objects; hence we speak of a person's _susceptibility_ to take cold or his _susceptibility_ to be affected with grief, joy, or any other passion: if an excess of _sensibility_ be an evil, an excess of _susceptibility_ is a still greater evil; it makes us slaves to every circumstance, however trivial, which comes under our notice. 

####feign 
**FEIGN, PRETEND.**  
_Feign_, in Latin _fingo_ or _figo_, meant originally to fashion with the hands. _Pretend_, in Latin _prœ_, before, and _tendere_, to stretch, signifies properly to stretch before, that is, to put on the outside.  
These words may be used for either doing or saying; they are both opposed to what is true, but they differ from the motives of the agent: to _feign_ is taken in either a bad or an indifferent sense; to _pretend_, always in a bad sense: one _feigns_ in order to gain some future end; a person _feigns_ sickness in order to be excused from paying a disagreeable visit: one _pretends_ in order to serve a present purpose; a child _pretends_ to have lost his book who wishes to excuse himself for his idleness. To _feign_ consists often of a line of conduct; to _pretend_ consists mostly of words, sometimes coupled with assumed looks and manners: Ulysses _feigned_ madness in order to escape from going to the Trojan war: according to Virgil, the Grecian Sinon _pretended_ to be a deserter come over to the Trojan camp.  
In matters, of speculation, to _feign_ is to invent by force of the imagination; to _pretend_ is to set up by force of self-conceit or false opinion: it is _feigned_ by the poets that Orpheus went down into hell and brought back Eurydice, his wife; infidel philosophers _pretend_ to account for the most mysterious things in nature upon natural or, as they please to term it, rational principles.

####felicitate 
**FELICITATE, CONGRATULATE.**  
_Felicitate_, from the Latin _felix_, happy, signifies to make happy, and is applicable only to ourselves; _congratulate_ from _gratus_, pleasant or agreeable, is to make agreeable, and is applicable to either ourselves or others: _we felicitate_ ourselves on having escaped the danger; we _congratulate_ others on their good fortune. 

####fellowship 
**FELLOWSHIP, SOCIETY.**  
Both these terms are employed to denote a close intercourse; but _fellowship_ is said of men as individuals, _society_ of them collectively: we should be careful not to hold _fellowship_ with any one of bad character, or to join the _society_ of those who profess bad principles. 

####felon 
See **criminal** under [crime](entry://crime)

####female 
**FEMALE, FEMININE, EFFEMINATE.**  
_Female_ is said of the sex itself, and _feminine_ of the characteristics of the sex. _Female_ is opposed to male, _feminine_ to masculine.  
In the _female_ character we expect to find that which is _feminine._ The _female_ dress, manners, and habits have engaged the attention of all essayists from the time of Addison to the present period. The _feminine_ is natural to the _female;_ the _effeminate_ is unnatural to the male. A _feminine_ air and voice, which is truly grateful to the observer in the one sex, is an odious mark of _effeminacy_ in the other. Beauty and delicacy _axe feminine_ properties; robustness and vigor are masculine properties; the former, therefore, when discovered in a man, entitle him to the epithet _effeminate._

####fence 
**FENCE, GUARD, SECURITY.**  
_Fence_ is a contraction of _defence. Guard_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _weardian_, to watch, allied to ward, wary, etc.; _gu_ is the French form corresponding to Germanic _w_ — as in _guise_ and _wise_, for example. _Security_ implies that which secures or prevents injury, mischief, and loss. A _fence_, in the proper sense, is an inanimate object; a _guard_ is a living agent; the former is of permanent utility, the latter acts to a partial extent: in the figurative sense they retain the same distinction. Modesty is a _fence_ to a woman's virtue; the love of the subject is the monarch's greatest _safeguard._ There are prejudices which favor religion and subordination, and act as _fences_ against the introduction of licentious principles into the juvenile or unenlightened mind; a proper sense of an overruling Providence will serve as a _guard_ to prevent the admission of improper thoughts. The _guard_ only stands at the entrance to prevent the ingress of evil: the _security_ stops up all the avenues, it locks up with firmness. A _guard_ serves to prevent the ingress of everything that may have an evil intention or tendency: the _security_ rather secures the possession of what one has and prevents a loss. A king has a _guard_ about his person to keep off all violence. 

####ferment 
See [ebullition](entry://ebullition); FERMENTATION. 

####ferocious 
**FEROCIOUS, FIERCE; SAVAGE. **  
_Ferocious_ and _fierce_ are both derived from the Latin _ferox_, from _ferus_, wild. _Savage_ (see [cruel](entry://cruel)).  
_Ferocity_ marks the untamed character of a cruel disposition: _fierceness_ has a greater mixture of pride and anger in it, the word _fier_ in French being taken for haughtiness: _savageness_ marks a more permanent, but not so violent, a sentiment of either cruelty or anger as the former two. _Ferocity_ and _fierceness_ are in common applied to the brutes to designate their natural tempers: _savage_ is mostly employed to designate the natural tempers of man when uncontrolled by the force of reason and a sense of religion. _Ferocity_ is the natural characteristic of wild beasts; it is a delight in blood that needs no outward stimulus to call it into action; but it displays itself most strikingly in the moment when the animal is going to grasp, or when in the act of devouring, its prey: _fierceness_ may be provoked in many creatures, but it does not discover itself unless roused by some circumstance of aggravation; many animals become _fierce_ by being shut up in cages and exposed to the view of spectators: _savageness_ is as natural a temper in the uncivilized man as _ferocity_ or _fierceness_ in the brute; it does not wait for an enemy to attack, but is restless in search of some one whom it may make an enemy and have an opportunity of destroying. It is an easy transition for the savage to become the _ferocious_ cannibal, glutting himself in the blood of his enemies, or the _fierce_ antagonist to one who sets himself up in opposition to him.  
In an extended application of these terms, they bear the same relation to one another: the countenance may be either _ferocious, fierce_, or _savage_, according to circumstances. A robber who spends his life in the act of unlawfully shedding blood acquires a _ferocity_ of countenance: a soldier who follows a predatory and desultory mode of warfare betrays the licentiousness of his calling and his undisciplined temper in the _fierceness_ of his countenance; the tyrant whose enjoyment consists in inflicting misery on his dependants or subjects evinces the _savageness_ of his temper by the _savage_ joy with which he witnesses their groans and tortures. 

####fertile 
**FERTILE, FRUITFUL, PROLIFIC.**  
_Fertile_, in Latin _fertilis_, from _ferre_, to bear, signifies capable of bearing or bringing to light. _Fruitful_ signifies full of _fruit_, or containing within itself much _fruit. Prolific_ is compounded of _proles_ and _facere_, to make a progeny.  
_Fertile_ expresses in its proper sense the faculty of sending forth from itself that which is not of its own nature, and is peculiarly applicable to the ground which causes everything within itself to grow up. _Fruitful_ expresses a state containing or possessing abundantly that which is of the same nature; it is, therefore, peculiarly applicable to trees, plants, vegetables, and whatever is said to bear _fruit. Prolific_ expresses the faculty of generating; it conveys, therefore, the idea of what is creative, and is peculiarly applicable to animals. We may say that the ground is either _fertile_ or _fruitful_, but not so properly _prolific:_ we may speak of a female of any species being _fruitful_ and _prolific_, but not _fertile;_ we may speak of nature as being _fruitful_, but neither _fertile_ nor _prolific._ A country is _fertile_ as it respects the quality of the soil; it is _fruitful_ as it respects the abundance of its produce: it is possible, therefore, for a country to be _fruitful_ by the industry of its inhabitants which was not _fertile_ by nature. An animal is said to be _fruitful_ as it respects the number of young which it has; it is said to be _prolific_ as it respects its generative power. Some women are more _fruitful_ than others; but there are many animals more _prolific_ than human creatures. In the figurative application they admit of a similar distinction. A man is _fertile_ in expedients who readily contrives upon the spur of the occasion; he is _fruitful_ in resources who has them ready at his hand; his brain is _prolific_ if it generates an abundance of new conceptions. A mind is _fertile_ which has powers that admit of cultivation and expansion: an imagination is _fruitful_ that is rich in stores of imagery; a genius is _prolific_ that is rich in invention. Females are _fertile_ in expedients and devices; ambition and avarice are the most _fruitful_ sources of discord and misery in public and private life; novel-writers are the most _prolific_ class of authors. 

####fervor 
**FERVOR, ARDOR.**  
_Fervor_, from _fervere_, to boil, is not so violent a heat as _ardor_, from _ardere_, to burn. The affections are properly _fervent;_ the passions are _ardent:_ we are _fervent_ in feeling, and _ardent_ in acting; the _fervor_ of devotion may be rational, but the _ardor_ of zeal is mostly intemperate. The first martyr, Stephen, was filled with a holy _fervor;_ St. Peter, in the _ardor_ of his zeal, promised his Master to do more than he was able to perform.

####festivity 
**FESTIVITY, MIRTH.**  
There is commonly _mirth_ and _festivity_, but there may be frequently _mirth_ without _festivity._ The _festivity_ lies in the outward circumstances, _mirth_ in the temper of the mind. _Festivity_ is rather the producer of _mirth_ than the _mirth_ itself. _Festivity_ includes the social enjoyments of eating, drinking, dancing, cards, and other pleasures: _mirth_ includes in it the buoyancy of spirits which is engendered by a participation in such pleasures.

####fiction 
**FICTION, FABRICATION, FALSEHOOD.**  
_Fiction_ is opposed to what is real; _fabrication_ and _falsehood_ to what is true. _Fiction_ relates what may be, though not what is: _fabrication_ and _falsehood_ relate what is not as what is, and _vice versa. Fiction_ serves for amusement and instruction: _fabrication_ and _falsehood_ serve to mislead and deceive. _Fiction_ and _fabrication_ both require invention: _falsehood_ consists of simple contradiction. The fables of Æsop are _fictions_ of the simplest kind, but yet such as require a peculiarly lively fancy and inventive genius to produce: the _fabrication_ of a play, as the production of Shakespeare's pen, was once executed with sufficient skill to impose for a time upon the public credulity: a good memory is all that is necessary in order to avoid uttering _falsehoods_ that can be easily contradicted and confuted. In an extended sense of the word _fiction_, it approaches still nearer to the sense of _fabricate_, when said of the _fictions_ of the ancients, which were delivered as truth, although admitted now to be false: the motive of the narrator is what here constitutes the difference, namely, that in the former case he believes what he relates to be true, in the latter he knows it to be false. The heathen mythology consists principally of the _fictions_ of the poets: newspapers commonly abound in _fabrication. Fabrication_ may sometimes be used in a good sense: in this case it denotes not the thing _fabricated_, but the act of _fabricating._  
As epithets, _fictitious_ and _false_ are very closely allied; for what is _fictitious_ is _false_, though all that is _false_ is not _fictitious:_ the _fictitious_ is that which has been feigned, or _falsely_ made by some one; the _false_ is simply that which is _false_ by the nature of the thing; the _fictitious_ account is therefore the invention of an individual, whose veracity is thereby impeached; but there may be many _false_ accounts unintentionally circulated.

####figure 
**FIGURE, METAPHOR, ALLEGORY EMBLEM, SYMBOL, TYPE.**  
_Figure_, in Latin _figura_, from _fingere_, to fashion or shape, signifies anything painted or feigned by the mind. _Metaphor_, in  
Greek _μεταφορά_, from _μεταφέρειν_, to transfer, signifies a transfer of one object to another. _Allegory_, in Greek _άλληγορία_, from _άλλος_, another, and _άγορέυειν_, to relate, signifies the relation of something under a borrowed term. _Emblem_, in Greek _έμβλημα._ from _έμβάλλειν_, to impress, signifies the thing stamped on as a mark. _Symbol_, from the Greek _συμβάλλειν_, to consider attentively, signifies the thing cast or conceived in the mind, from its analogy to represent something else. _Type_, in Greek _τύπος_, from _τύπτειν_, to strike or stamp, signifies an image of something that is stamped on something else.  
Likeness between two objects, by which one is made to represent the other, is the common idea in the signification of these terms. _Figure_ is the most general of these terms, comprehending everything which is figured by means of the imagination; the rest are but modes of the _figure._ The _figure_ consists either in words or in things generally: we may have a _figure_ in expression, a _figure_ on paper, a _figure_ on wood or stone, and the like. It is the business of the imagination to draw _figures_ out of anything; the _metaphor_ and _allegory_ consist of a representation by means of words only; the _figure_, in this case, is any representation which the mind makes to itself of a resemblance between objects, which is properly a _figure_ of thought, which when clothed in words is a _figure_ of speech: the _metaphor_ is a _figure_ of speech of the simplest kind, by which a word acquires other meanings besides that which is originally affixed to it; as when the term head, which properly signifies a part of the body, is applied to the leader of an army. The _allegory_ is a continued _metaphor_, where attributes, modes, and actions are applied to the objects thus _figured_, as in the _allegory_ of sin and death in Milton.  
The _emblem_ is that sort of _figure_ of thought by which we make corporeal objects to stand for moral properties; thus the dove is represented as the _emblem_ of meekness, or the beehive is made the _emblem_ of industry: the _symbol_ is that species of _emblem_ which is converted into a constituted sign among men; thus the olive and laurel are the _symbols_ of peace, and have been recognized as such among barbarous as well as enlightened nations.  
The _type_ is that, species of _emblem_ by which one object is made to represent another mystically; it is, therefore, only employed in religious matters, particularly in relation to the coming, the office, and the death of our Saviour; in this manner the offering of Isaac is considered as a _type_ of our Saviour's offering himself as an atoning sacrifice.

####final 
**FINAL, CONCLUSIVE.**  
_Final_, in French _final_, Latin _finalis_, from _finis_, the end, signifies having an end. _Conclusive_ signifies shutting up, or coming to a conclusion.  
_Final_ designates simply the circumstance of being the last; _conclusive_ the mode of finishing or coming to the last: a. determination is _final_ which is to be succeeded by no other; a reasoning is _conclusive_ that puts a stop to further question. The _final_ is arbitrary; it depends upon the will to make it so or not: the _conclusive_ is relative; it depends upon the circumstances and the understanding: a person gives a _final_ answer at option; but in order to make an answer _conclusive_ it must be satisfactory to all parties.

####find 
**FIND, FIND OUT, DISCOVER, ESPY, DESCRY.**  
_Find_, is in Anglo-Saxon _findan_, German _finden_, etc. _Discover_ (see [detect](entry://detect)). _Espy_ comes through French from the Old High German _spehon_, to spy. _Descry_ comes from Latin _describere_, from _de_, down, and _scribere_, to write, meaning to make a note of, hence to see and notice. To _find_ signifies simply to come within sight of a thing, which is the general idea attached to all these terms: they vary, however, either in the mode of the action or in the object. What we _find_ may become visible to us by accident, but what we _find out_ is the result of an effort, We may _find_ anything as we pass along in the streets: but we _find out_ mistakes in an account by carefully going over it, or we _find out_ the difficulties which we meet with in learning by redoubling our diligence. What is _found_ may have been lost to ourselves, but visible to others. What is _discovered_ is always remote and unknown, and when _discovered_ is something new. A piece of money may be _found_ lying on the ground; but a mine is _discovered_ underground. When Captain Cook _discovered_ the islands in the South Sea, many plants and animals were _found._ What is not _discoverable_ may be presumed not to exist; but that which is _found_ may be only what has been lost. What has once been _discovered_ cannot be _discovered_ again; but what is _found_ may be many times _found. Find out_ and _discover_ differ principally in the application, the former being applied to familiar, and the latter to scientific objects: scholars _find out_ what they have to learn; men of research _discover_ what escapes the notice of others.  
To _espy_ is a species of _finding out_, namely, to _find out_ what is very secluded or retired; and _descry_ is a species of _discovering_ or observing at a distance or among a number of objects. An astronomer _discovers_ fresh stars or planets; _he finds out_ those on particular occasions which had been already _discovered._ A person _finds out_ by continued inquiry any place to which he had been wrongly directed: he _espies_ an object which lies concealed in a corner or secret place; he _descries_ a horseman coming down a hill. _Find_ and _discover_ may be employed with regard to objects, either of a corporeal or intellectual kind; _espy_ and _descry_, only with regard to sensible objects of corporeal vision: _find_, for those that are either external or internal; _discover_, only for those that are external. The distinction between them is the same as before; we _find_ by simple inquiry; we _discover_ by reflection and study: we _find_ or _find out_ the motives which influence a person's conduct; we _discover_ the reasons or causes of things: the _finding_ serves the particular purpose of the _finder;_ the _discovery_ serves the purpose of science, by adding to the stock of general knowledge.  
When _find_ is used as a purely intellectual operation, it admits of a new view, in relation both to _discover_ and to _invent_, as may be seen in the following article.  
**FIND, FIND OUT, DISCOVER, INVENT.** — To _find_ or _find out_ is said of things which do not exist in the forms in which a person _finds_ them: to _discover_ is said of that which exists in an entire state:_ invent_, from _invenire_, signifying literally to come upon, is said of that which is newly made or modelled. The merit of _finding_ or _inventing_ consists in newly applying or modifying the materials which exist separately; the merit of _discovering_ consists in removing the obstacles which prevent us from knowing the real nature of the thing: imagination and industry are requisite for _finding_ or _inventing;_ acuteness and penetration for _discovering. Find_ is applicable to the operative arts, _invent_ to the mechanical, _discover_ to the speculative. We speak of _finding_ modes for performing actions and effecting purposes: of _inventing_ machines, instruments, and various matters of use or elegance; of _discovering_ the operations and laws of nature. Many fruitless attempts have been made to _find_ the longitude: men have not been so unsuccessful in _finding out_ various arts for communicating their thoughts, commemorating the exploits of their nations, and supplying themselves with luxuries. Harvey _discovered_ the circulation of the blood: the geometrician _finds_ by reasoning the solution of any problem; or by investigating he _finds out_ a clearer method of solving the same problem; or he _invents_ an instrument by which the proof can be deduced from ocular demonstration.  
**FIND FAULT WITH, BLAME, OBJECT TO.** — All these terms denote not simply feeling, but also expressing, dissatisfaction with some person or thing. To _find fault with_ signifies here to point out a _fault_, either in some person or thing; to _blame_ is said only of the person; _object_ is applied to the thing only: we _find fault with_ a person for his behavior; we _find fault with_ our seat, our conveyance, and the like; we _blame_ a person for his temerity or his improvidence; we _object_ to a measure that is proposed. We _find fault with_ or _blame_ that which has been done; we _object to_ that which has been or is to be done. _Finding fault_ is a familiar action applied to matters of personal convenience or taste; _blame_ and _object to_, particularly the latter, are applied to serious objects. _Finding fault_ is often the fruit of a discontented temper; there are some whom nothing will please, and who are ever ready to _find fault with_ whatever comes in their way: _blame_ is a matter of discretion; we _blame_ frequently in order to correct: _objecting to_ is an affair either of caprice or discretion; some capriciously _object to_ that which is proposed to them merely from a spirit of opposition; others _object to_ a thing from substantial reasons. 

####fine 
**FINE, DELICATE, NICE.**  
It is remarkable of the word _fine_ (see [beautiful](entry://beautiful)) that it is equally applicable to large and small objects: _delicate_, in Latin _delicatus_, from _deliciœ_, delights, and _delicere_, to allure, is applied only to small objects. _Fine_, in the natural sense, denotes smallness in general. _Delicate_ denotes a degree of _fineness_ that is agreeable to the taste. Thread is said to be _fine_, as opposed to the coarse and thick; silk is said to be _delicate_ when to fineness of texture it adds softness. The texture of a spider's web is remarkable for its _fineness;_ that of the ermine's fur is remarkable for its _delicacy._ In writing, all up-strokes must be _fine;_ but in superior writing they will be _delicately fine._ When applied to colors, the _fine_ is coupled with the bold and strong; _delicate_, with what is faint, soft, and fair: black and red may be _fine_ colors; white and pink _delicate_ colors. The tulip is reckoned one of the _finest_ flowers; the white moss-rose is a _delicate_ flower. A _fine_ painter delineates with boldness; but the artist who has a _delicate_ taste throws _delicate_ touches into the grandest delineations.  
In their moral application these terms admit of the same distinction: the _fine_ approaches either to the strong or to the weak; the _delicate_ is a high degree of the _fine;_ as a _fine_ thought, which may be lofty; or _fine_ feeling, which is acute and tender; and _delicate_ feeling, which exceeds the former in _fineness._ The French use their word _fin_ only in the latter sense, of acuteness, and apply it merely to the thoughts and designs of men, answering either to our word _subtle_, as _un homme fin_, or _neat_, as _une satire fine. Delicate_ is said of that which is agreeable to the sense and the taste; _nice_, to what is agreeable to the appetite: the former is a term of refinement, the latter of epicurism and sensual indulgence. The _delicate_ affords pleasure only to those whose thoughts and desires are purified from what is gross; the _nice_ affords pleasure to the young, the ignorant, and the sensual: thus _delicate_ food, _delicate_ colors, _delicate_ shapes and forms, are always acceptable to the cultivated; a meal, a show, a color, and the like, which suits its appetite or meets its fancy, will be _nice_ to a child.  
When used in a moral application, _nice_, which is taken in a good sense, approaches nearer to the signification of _delicate._ A person may be said to have a _delicate_ ear in music whose ear is offended with the smallest discordance; he may be said to have a _nice_ taste or judgment in music who scientifically discriminates the beauties and defects of different pieces. A person is _delicate_ in his choice who is guided by taste and feeling; he is _nice_ in his choice who adheres to a strict rule. A point in question may be either _delicate_ or _nice;_ it is _delicate_ as it is likely to touch the tender feelings of any party; it is _nice_ as it involves contrary interests and becomes difficult of determination. There are _delicacies_ of behavior which are learned by good-breeding, but which minds of a refined cast are naturally alive to without any particular learning; there are _niceties_ in the law which none but men of superior intellect can properly enter into and discriminate.  
**FINE, MULCT, PENALTY, FORFEITURE.** — _Fine_, from the Latin _finis_, the end or purpose, signifies, by an extended application, satisfaction by way of amenda for an offence. _Mulct_, in Latin, _mulcta_, comes from _mulcare_, to injure. _Penalty_, in Latin _pœnalitas_, from _pœna_, a pain, signifies what gives pain by way of punishment. _Forfeiture_, from _forfeit_, comes through French from Late Latin _foris factum_, a trespass, from _foris_, beyond, and _facere_, to do, signifying an action beyond the bounds of law, hence a penalty for illegal action.  
The _fine_ and _mulct_ are always pecuniary; a _penalty_ may be pecuniary; a _forfeiture_ consists of the deprivation of any right or property: _the fine_ and _mulct_ are imposed; the _penalty_ is inflicted or incurred; the _forfeiture_ is incurred. The violation of a rule or law is attended with a _fine_ or _mulct_, but the former is a term of general use; the latter is rather a technical term in law: a criminal offence incurs a _penalty;_ negligence of duty occasions the _forfeiture._ A _fine_ or _mulct_ serves either as punishment to the offender or as an amends for the offence: a _penalty_ always inflicts some kind of pain as a punishment on the offender: a _forfeiture_ is attended with loss as a punishment to the delinquent. Among the Chinese all offences are punished with _fines_ or flogging: the Roman Catholics were formerly subject to _penalties_ if detected in the performance of their religious worship: societies subject their members to _forfeitures_ for the violation of their laws.  
**FINICAL, SPRUCE, FOPPISH.** — These epithets are applied to such as attempt at finery by improper means. The _finical_ is insignificantly fine; the _spruce_ is laboriously and artfully fine; the _foppish_ is fantastically and affectedly fine. The _finical_ is said mostly of manners and speech: the _spruce_ is said of the dress; the _foppish_, of dress and manners.  
A _finical_ gentleman clips his words and screws his body into as small a compass as possible, to give himself the air of a delicate person: a _spruce_ gentleman strives not to have a fold wrong in his frill or cravat, nor a hair of his head to he amiss: a _foppish_ gentleman seeks, by extravagance in the cut of his clothes and by the tawdriness in their ornaments, to render himself distinguished for finery. A little mind, full of conceit of itself, will lead a man to be _finical:_ a vacant mind that is anxious to be pleasing will not object to the employment of rendering the person _spruce:_ a giddy, vain mind, eager after applause, impels a man to every kind of _foppery._

####finite 
**FINITE, LIMITED.**  
_Finite_, from _finis_, an end, is the natural property of things; and _limited_, from _limes_, a boundary, is the artificial property: the former is opposite only to the _infinite;_ but the latter, which lies within the _finite_, is opposed to the _unlimited_ or the _infinite._ This world is _finite_, and space _infinite;_ the power of a prince is _limited._ It is not in our power to extend the bounds of the _finite_, but the _limited_ is mostly under our control. We are _finite_ beings, and our capacities are variously _limited_ either by nature or circumstances. 

####fire 
**FIRE, HEAT, WARMTH, GLOW.**  
In the proper sense these words are easily distinguished, but not so easily in the improper sense; and as the latter depends principally upon the former, it is not altogether useless to enter into some explanation of their physical meaning.  
_Fire_ is with regard to _heat_ as the cause to the effect; it is itself an inherent property in some material bodies, and when in action communicates _heat: fire_ is perceptible to us by the eye as well as the touch; _heat_ is perceptible only by the touch; we distinguish _fire_ by means of the flame it sends forth or by the changes which it produces upon other bodies; but we discover _heat_ only by the sensations which it produces in ourselves.  
_Heat_ and _warmth_ differ principally in degree, the latter being a gentle degree of the former. The term _heat_ is, however, in its most extensive sense, applicable to that universal principle which pervades all nature, animate and inanimate, and seems to vivify the whole; it is this principle which appears either under the form of _fire_ or under the more commonly conceived form of _heat_, as it is generally understood and as I have here considered it. _Heal_ in this limited sense is less active than _fire_ and more active than _warmth:_ the former is produced in bodies, either by the violent action of _fire_, as in the boiling of water, the melting of lead, or the violent friction of two hard bodies; the latter is produced by the simple expulsion of cold, as in the case of feathers, wool, and other substances which produce and retain _warmth. Glow_ is a partial _heat_ or _warmth_ which exists, or is known to exist, mostly in the human frame; it is commonly produced in the body when it is in its most vigorous state and its nerves are firmly braced by the cold.  
From the above analysis the figurative application of these terms, and the grounds upon which they are so employed, will be easily discerned. As _fire_ is the strongest and most active principle in nature, which seizes everything within its reach with the greatest possible rapidity, genius is said to be possessed of _fire_, which flies with rapidity through all the regions of thought and forms the most lively images and combinations; but when _fire_ is applied to the eye or the looks, it borrows its meaning from the external property of the flame, which is very aptly depicted in the eye or the looks of lively people. As _heat_ is always excessive and mostly violent, those commotions and fermentations of the mind which flow from the agitation of the passions, particularly of the angry passions, are termed _heat._ As _warmth_ is a gentle and grateful property, it has with most propriety been ascribed to the affections. As _glow_ is a partial but vivid feeling of the body, so is friendship a strong but particular affection of the mind: hence the propriety of ascribing a _glow_ to friendship. Age damps the _fire_ of the poet. Disputants in the _heat_ of the contest are apt to forget all the forms of good-breeding. A man of tender moral feelings speaks with _warmth_ of a noble action, or takes a _warm_ interest in the concerns of the innocent and the distressed. A youth in the full _glow_ of friendship feels himself prepared to make any sacrifices in supporting the cause of his friend. 

####firm 
**FIRM, FIXED, SOLID, STABLE.**  
_Firm_ (see [constancy](entry://constancy)). _Fixed_ denotes the state of being _fixed. Solid_, in Latin _solidus_, comes from _solum_, the ground, which is the most solid thing existing. _Stable_ (see [constancy](entry://constancy)).  
That is _firm_ which is not easily shaken; that is _fixed_ which is fastened to something else and not easily torn; that is _solid_ which is able to bear, and does not easily give way; that is _stable_ which is able to make a stand against resistance or the effects of time. A pillar which is _firm_ on its base, _fixed_ to a wall made of _solid_ oak, is likely to be _stable._ A man stands _firm_ in battle who does not flinch from the attack: he is _fixed_ to a spot by the order of his commander.  
In the moral sense, _firmness_ is used only for the purpose, or such actions as depend on the purpose; _fixed_ is used either for the mind or for outward circumstances; _solid_ is applicable to things in general, in an absolute sense; _stable_ is applicable to things in a relative sense. Decrees are more or less _firm_, according to the source from which they spring; none are _firm_, compared with those which arise from the will of the Almighty: laws are _fixed_ in proportion as they are connected with a constitution in which it is difficult to innovate. That which is _solid_ is so of its own nature, but does not admit of degrees: a _solid_ reason has within itself an independent property, which cannot be increased or diminished. That which is _stable_ is so by comparison with that which is of less duration: the characters of some men are more _stable_ than those of others; youth will not have so _stable_ a character as manhood. A friendship is _firm_ when it does not depend upon the opinion of others; it is _fixed_ when the choice is made and grounded in the mind; it is _solid_ when it rests on the only _solid_ basis of accordancy in virtue and religion; it is _stable_ when it is not liable to decrease or die away with time.

####first 
**FIRST, ABORIGINAL, ORIGINAL, PRIMARY.**  
All these words signify holding the _first_ place, but to the general idea of being simply number one in any counting which is indicated in_ first, aboriginal, original_, and _primary_ add certain subsidiary notions. _Original_, from Latin _oriri_, to rise, means the first to appear or arise, and refers to the beginning of something, considered with reference to that which follows after the beginning or develops out of it. When we speak of the _first_ language spoken in England, we are thinking of this language simply as number one in a series; when we speak of the _original_ language of the Aryan peoples, we are thinking of it with reference to the languages which followed after it or developed out of it. The difference is not of meaning, but of emphasis. _Aboriginal_, from the phrase _ab origine_, meaning from the beginning, has the meaning of _original_ specifically applied to the first tribes or peoples inhabiting a given land. _Primary_, from Latin _primus_, first, means _first_, not merely with respect to numbers, but with respect to relation. It differs from _original_ in emphasizing, not the idea of the beginning, but the idea of the relation of the things designated as _primary_ to something else of which they are considered a part.

####fit 
**FIT, APT, MEET.**  
_Fit_ (see [becoming](entry://becoming)) is either an acquired or a natural property; _apt_, in Latin _aptus_, from the Old Latin _apere_, to fit or join together, is a natural property; _meet_, from Anglo-Saxon _metan_, signifying measured, is a moral quality. A house is _fit_ for the accommodation of the family according to the plan of the builder; the young mind is _apt_ to receive either good or bad impressions. _Meet_ is a term of rare use, except in spiritual matters or in poetry, it is _meet_ to offer our prayers to the Supreme Disposer of all things.  
**FIT, EQUIP, PREPARE, QUALIFY.** — To _fit_ signifies to adopt means in order to make _fit_, and conveys the general sense of all the other terms; they differ principally in the means and circumstances of _fitting:_ to _equip_ is to _fit_ out by furnishing the necessary materials: to _prepare_, from the Latin _prœparare_, compounded of _prœ_ and _parare_, to get beforehand, is to take steps for the purpose of _fitting_ in future: to _qualify_, from the Latin _qualifacere_, or _qualis_ and _facere_, to make a thing as it should be, is to _fit_ or furnish with any requisites.  
_To fit_ is employed for ordinary cases; to _equip_ is employed only for expeditions: a house is _fitted_ up for the residence of a family; a vessel is _equipped_ with everything requisite for a voyage; to _fit_ may be for an immediate or a remote purpose; to _prepare_ is for a remote purpose; to _fit_ does not define the means; to _prepare_ requires for the most part labor, time, and expense. A persons _fits_ himself for taking orders when he is at the university: he _prepares_ for an examination by going over what he has already learned.  
To _fit_ is said of everything, both in a natural and a moral sense: to _qualify_ is used only in a moral sense. _Fit_ is employed mostly for acquirements which are gained by physical exertions; _qualify_ for those which are gained by intellectual exertion: a youth _fits_ himself for a mechanical business by working at it; a youth _qualifies_ himself for a profession by following a particular course of studies.

**FIT, SUIT, ADAPT, ACCOMMODATE, ADJUST.** — _Fit_ signifies to make or be _fit. Suit_ signifies to make or be _suitable_ (see [agree](entry://agree)). _Adapt_, from _aptus_, fit, signifies to make _fit_ for a specific purpose. _Accommodate_ signifies to make commodious. _Adjust_ signifies to make a thing just as it is desired to be.  
To _fit_, in the transitive sense, is to make of like proportions, so that one thing may join with another as it ought: as to _fit_ one board to another; to _fit_ clothes to the body: to _suit_ is to make things agreeable to one another, and is mostly applied to moral objects: as to _suit_ one's actions or language to the occasion.  
_Fit_ may likewise be figuratively applied to moral objects, in the sense of making one object fit for another, as to _fit_ a person by his education for a particular walk of life; to _fit_ the mind for the reception of truth.  
In the transitive sense these words have precisely the same distinction: as the shoe _fits_, or _fits_ the foot, which is made to the same size; things _suit_ which agree in essential qualities or produce an agreeable effect when placed together; as furniture is made to _suit._  
In the moral sense, the _fitness_ of things is what we term just, right, or decent: that which _suits_ falls in with our ideas and feelings.  
To _adapt_ is a species of _fitting;_ to _accommodate_ is a species of _suiting;_ both applied to the moral actions of conscious beings. _Adaptation_ is an act of the judgment; _accommodation_ is an act of the will; we _adapt_ by an exercise of discretion; we _accommodate_ by a management of the humors: an _adaptation_ does not interfere with our interests; but an _accommodation_ always supposes a sacrifice: we _adapt_ our language to the understandings of our hearers; we _accommodate_ ourselves to the humors of others. The mind of an infinitely wise Creator is clearly evinced in the world by the universal _adaptation_ of means to their ends: a spirit of _accommodation_ is not merely a characteristic of politeness: it is of sufficient importance to be ranked among the Christian duties.  
_Accommodate_ and _adjust_ are both applied to the affairs of men which require to be kept, or put, in right order: but the former implies the keeping as well as putting in order; the latter simply the putting in order. Men _accommodate_ each other, that is, make things commodious for one another; but they _adjust_ things either for themselves or for others. Thus they _accommodate_ one another in pecuniary matters; or they _adjust_ the ceremonial of a visit. _Accommodate_ likewise always supposes a certain sacrifice or yielding on the part of the person _accommodating_ for the convenience of the person _accommodated._ On this ground we may say that a difference is either _accommodated_ or _adjusted;_ for it is _accommodated_, inasmuch as the parties yield to each other so as to make it _commodious_ to both; it is _adjusted_, inasmuch as that which was wrong is set right.

####fix 
**FIX, FASTEN, STICK.**  
_Fix_ is a generic term; _fasten, i.e._, to make fast, and _stick, i.e._, to make to stick, are but modes of _fixing:_ we _fix_ whatever we make to remain in a given situation; we _fasten_ if we _fix_ it firmly; we _stick_ when we _fix_ a thing by means of _sticking._ A post is _fixed_ in the ground; it is _fastened_ to a wall by a nail; it is _stuck_ to another board by means of glue. Shelves are _fixed:_ a horse is _fastened_ to a gate; bills are _stuck._ What is _fixed_ may be removed in various ways: what is _fastened_ is removed by main force: what is _stuck_ must be separated by contrivance.  
See also [firm](entry://firm)  
**FIX, SETTLE, ESTABLISH.** — _Fix_, in Latin _fixi_, perfect of _figo_, signifies simply to make to keep its place. _Settle_, from Anglo-Saxon _sell_, seat, allied to _sit_, signifies to make to sit or be at rest. _Establish_, from the Latin _stabilis_, signifies to make stable. _Fix_ is the general and indefinite term: to _settle_ and _establish_ are to fix strongly. _Fix_ and _settle_ are applied either to material or spiritual objects, _establish_ only to moral objects. A post may be _fixed_ in the ground in any manner, but it requires time for it to _settle._ A person may either _fix_ himself, _settle_ himself, or _establish_ himself: the first case refers simply to his taking up his abode or choosing a certain spot; the second refers to his permanency of stay; and the third to the business which he raises or renders permanent.  
The same distinction exists between these words in their further application to the conduct of men. We may _fix_ one or many points, important or unimportant — it is a mere act of the will; we _settle_ many points of importance — it is an act of deliberation; thus we _fix_ the day and hour of doing a thing; we _settle_ the affairs of our family: so. likewise to _fix_ is properly the act of one; to _settle_ may be the joint act of many; thus a parent _fixes_ on a business for his child, or he _settles_ the marriage contract with another parent.  
To _fix_ and _settle_ are personal acts, and the objects are mostly of a private nature: but _establish_ is an indirect action, and the object mostly of a public nature: thus we _fix_ our opinions; we _settle_ our minds; or we are instrumental in _establishing_ laws, institutions, and the like. It is much to be lamented that any one should remain _unsettled_ in his faith; and still more so, that the best form of faith is not universally _established._  
**FIX, DETERMINE, SETTLE, LIMIT.** — To _fix_ is here the general term; to _determine_ (see [decide](entry://decide)); to _settle_ (see [preceding](entry://preceding)); to _limit_ (see [bound](entry://bound)), are here modes of _fixing._ They all denote the acts of conscious agents, but differ in the object and circumstances of the action; we may _fix_ any object by any means and to any point; we may _fix_ material objects or spiritual objects; we may _fix_ either by means of our senses or our thoughts; but we can _determine_ only by means of our thoughts. To _fix_, in distinction from the rest, is said in regard to a single point or a line; but to _determine_ is always said of one or more points or a whole: we _fix_ where a thing shall begin; but we _determine_ where it shall begin and where it shall end, which way and how far it shall go, and the like: thus, we may _fix_ our eye upon a star, or we _fix_ our minds upon a particular branch of astronomy; but we _determine_ the distance of the heavenly bodies, or the specific gravity of bodies, and the like, upon philosophical principles.  
So in respect to other objects, to _fix_ is a positive and immediate act; as to _fix_ the day, hour, or minute, etc.; to _determine_ requires consideration; as to _determine_ times and seasons, or modes of doing things, and the like.  
_Determine_ is to _settle_ as a means to the end; we commonly _determine_ all subordinate matters in order to _settle_ a matter finally: thus, the _determination_ of a single cause will serve to _settle_ all other differences. The _determination_ respects the act of the individual who _fixes_ certain points and brings them to a term; the _settlement_ respects simply the conclusion of the affair or the termination of all dispute and question.  
To _determine_ and _limit_ both signify to _fix_ boundaries; but to _determine_ or _fix_ a term to a thing respects such _boundaries_ or terms as are formed by the nature of things: to _limit_ is the act of a conscious agent; a question is _determined_ by removing the doubt; the price is _limited_ by law, or the command of the magistrate, or the agreement of the parties.

####flag 
**FLAG, DROOP, LANGUISH, PINE.**  
_Flag_ comes from a Teutonic base found in Anglo-Saxon _flacor_, flying, roving, and Icelandic _flaka_, originally an imitative syllable found in _flap, flicker_, etc.; it means here to be weary after roving, to cease to rove, etc. _Droop_ (see [fall](entry://fall)). TO _languish_ is to become or continue languid (see [faint](entry://faint)). _Pine_, Middle English _pinen_, to suffer, more frequently to torment (from Anglo-Saxon _pin_, borrowed from Latin _pœna_, pain, penalty), means to languish with suffering.  
In the proper application nothing _flags_ but that which can be distended and made to flutter by the wind, as the leaves of plants when they are in want of water or in a weakly condition; hence figuratively the spirits are said to _flag:_ nothing is said to _droop_ but that the head of which _flags_ or _drops;_ the snow-drop _droops_, and flowers will generally _droop_ from excess of drought or heat: the spirits in the same manner are said to _droop_, which expresses more than to _flag;_ the human body also _droops_ when the strength fails: _languish_ is a still stronger expression than _droop_, and is applicable principally to persons; some _languish_ in sickness, some in prison, and some in a state of distress: to _pine_ is to be in a state of wearing pain which is mostly of a mental nature; a child may _pine_ when absent from all its friends and supposing itself deserted.

####flame 
**FLAME, BLAZE, FLASH, FLARE, GLARE.**  
_Flame_, in Latin _flamma_, from the Greek _φλέγειν_, to burn, signifies the luminous exhalation emitted from fire. _Blaze_, Anglo-Saxon _blœse_, torch, signifies a flame blown up, that is, an extended _flame: flash_ comes from Middle English _flaschen_, to dash, Icelandic _flas_, a swift rushing, and refers to a sudden rush of light. _Flare_ is only a variant of Swedish _flasa_, to burn violently. _Flash_ and _flare_, which are but variations of _flame_, denote different species of _flame;_ the former, a sudden _flame_, the second, a dazzling, unsteady _flame. Glare_, Anglo-Saxon _glœr_, amber, is possibly allied to glass; it refers to a sharp and shining flight, a strong _flame_, that emits a strong light: a candle burns only by _flame_, paper commonly by a _blaze_, gunpowder by a _flash_, a torch by a _flare_, and a conflagration by a _glare._

####flat 
**FLAT, LEVEL.**  
_Flat_ is a Scandinavian word of uncertain origin. _Level_, in all probability from _libella_ and _libra_, a balance, signifies the evenness of a balance. _Flat_ is said of a thing with regard to itself; it is opposed to the round or protuberant; _level_, as it respects another thing; it is opposed to the uneven: a country is _flat_ which has no elevation; a country is _level_ as contrasted with that which is mountainous, or a wall is _level_ with the roof of a house when it rises to the height of the roof.  
In the moral application they differ too widely to render comparison necessary.

####flatterer 
**FLATTERER, SYCOPHANT, PARASITE.**  
_Flatterer_ (see [adulate](entry://adulate)). _Sycophant_, in Greek _συκοφάντης_, signified originally an informer on the matter of figs, but has now acquired the meaning of an obsequious and servile person. _Parasite_, in Greek _παράσϊτος_, from _παρά_ and _σϊτος_, com or meat, originally referred to the priests who attended feasts, but it is now applied to a hanger-on at the tables of the great.  
The _flatterer_ is one who flatters by words; the _sycophant_ and _parasite_ is therefore always a _flatterer_, and something more, for the _sycophant_ adopts every mean artifice by which he can ingratiate himself, and the _parasite_ submits to every degradation and servile compliance by which he can obtain his base purpose. These terms differ more in the object than in the means, the former having general purposes of favor, and the latter particular and still lower purposes to answer. Courtiers may be _sycophants_ in order to be well with their prince and obtain preferment; but they are seldom _parasites_, who are generally poor and in want of a meal.

####flexible 
**FLEXIBLE, PLIABLE, PLIANT, SUPPLE.**  
_Flexible_, in Latin _fiexibilis_, from _flectere_, to bend, signifies able to be Dent. _Pliable_ signifies able to be _plied_ or folded: _pliant_ signifies literally _plying_, bending, or folding. _Supple_, in French _souple_, comes from Latin _supplicem_ (accusative), in the old sense of bending under; compare _supplicate. Flexible_ is used in a natural or moral sense; _pliable_, in the familiar sense only; _pliant_, in the higher and moral application only: what can be bent in any degree as a stick is _flexible;_ what can be bent as wax, or folded like cloth, is _pliable. Supple_, whether in a proper or a figurative sense, is an excess of _pliability;_ what can be bent backward and forward, like osier twig, is _supple._  
In the moral application, _flexible_ is indefinite both in degree and application; it may be greater or less in point of degree; whereas _pliant_ supposes a great degree of _pliability_, and _suppleness_ a great degree of _pliancy_ or _pliability;_ it applies likewise to the outward actions, to the temper, the resolution, or the principles; but _pliancy_ is applied to the principles or the conduct dependent upon those principles; _suppleness_, to the outward actions and behavior only. A temper is _flexible_ which yields to the entreaties of others; the person or character is _pliant_ when it is formed or moulded easily at the will of another; a person is _supple_ who makes his actions and his manners bend according to the varying humors of another: the first belongs to one in a superior station who yields to the wishes of the applicant; the latter two belong to equals or inferiors who yield to the influence of others. _Flexibility_ is frequently a weakness, but never a vice; it always consults the taste of others, sometimes to its own inconvenience and often in opposition to its judgment; _pliancy_ is often both a weakness and a vice: it always yields for its own pleasure, though not always in opposition to its sense of right and wrong: _suppleness_ is always a vice, but never a weakness; it seeks its gratification to the injury of another by flattering his passions. _Flexibility_ is opposed to firmness, _pliancy_ to steadiness, _suppleness_ to rigidity.

####flourish 
**FLOURISH, THRIVE, PROSPER.**  
_Flourish_, in French _fleurir, florissant_, Latin _floresco_, or _floreo_, from _flos_, a flower, is a figure of speech borrowed from the action of flowers which grow in full vigor and health. _Thrive_ is a Scandinavian word from a root signifying to seize, meaning to seize for one's self, hence to prosper. _Prosper_, in Latin _prosper, prosperus_, compounded of _pro_ and _spes_, hope, signifies to be agreeable to the hopes.  
To _flourish_ expresses the state of being that which is desirable: to _thrive_ the process of becoming so. In the proper sense, _flourish_ and _thrive_ are applied to vegetation: the former to that which is full grown, the latter to that which is in the act of growing: the oldest trees are said to _flourish_ which put forth their leaves and fruits in full vigor; young trees _thrive_ when they increase rapidly toward their full growth.  
_Flourish_ and _thrive_ are taken likewise in the moral sense; _prosper_ is employed only in this sense; _flourish_ is said either of individuals or of communities of men; _thrive_ and _prosper_ only of individuals. To _flourish_ is to be in full possession of powers, physical, intellectual, and incidental: an author _flourishes_ at a certain period; an institution _flourishes;_ literature or trade _flourishes;_ a nation _flourishes._ To _thrive_ is to carry on one's concerns to the advantage of one's circumstances; it is a term of familiar use for those who gain by positive labor: the industrious tradesman _thrives._ To _prosper_ is to be already in advantageous circumstances: men _prosper_ who accumulate wealth agreeably to their wishes and beyond their expectations. 

####flow 
**FLOW, STREAM, GUSH.**  
For the derivation of _flow_ see [arise](entry://arise). _Stream_ is, in Anglo-Saxon, _stream_, from a root signifying to flow. _Gush_ comes from a Teutonic root and is allied to Icelandic _gjiota_, to pour.  
_Flow_ is here the generic term: the other two are specific terms, expressing different modes: water may _flow_ either in a large body or in a long, but narrow course; the _stream_, in a long, narrow course only: thus, waters _flow_ in seas, rivers, rivulets, or in a small pond; they _stream_ only out of spouts or small channels: they _flow_ gently or otherwise; they _stream_ gently; but they _gush_ with violence: thus, the blood _flows_ from a wound which comes from it in any manner; it _streams_ from a wound when it runs, as it were, in a channel; it _gushes_ from a wound when it runs with impetuosity and in as large quantities as the cavity admits. See also [arise](entry://arise)

####fluctuate 
**FLUCTUATE, WAVER.**  
_Fluctuate_, in Latin _fluctuatus_, participle of _fluctuare_, from _fluctus_, a wave, signifies to move backward and forward like a wave. _Waver_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _wœfre_, restless, wandering; it is not, however, the same word as wave, which is allied to _wag._  
To _fluctuate_ conveys the idea of strong agitation; to _waver_, that of constant motion backward and for ward: when applied in the moral sense, to _fluctuate_ designates the action of the spirits or the opinions; to _waver_ is said only of the will or opinions: he who is alternately merry and sad in quick succession is said to be _fluctuating;_ or he who has many opinions in quick succession is said to _fluctuate;_ but he who cannot form an opinion or come to a resolution is said to _waver._

####fluent 
See [voluble](entry://voluble)

####fluid 
**FLUID, LIQUID, LIQUIDATE.**  
_Fluid_, from _fluere_, to flow, signifies that which from its nature flows; _liquid_, from _liquere_, to be clear, signifies that which is melted. These words may be employed as epithets to the same objects; but they have a distinct office, which they derive from their original meaning: when we wish to represent a thing as capable of passing along in a stream or current, we should denominate it a _fluid;_ when we wish to represent it as passing from a congealed to a dissolved state, we should name it a _liquid;_ water and air are both represented as _fluids_ from their general property of flowing through certain spaces; but ice, when thawed, becomes a _liquid_ and melts; melted lead is also termed a _liquid:_ the humors of the animal body and the juices of trees are _fluids;_ what we drink is a _liquid_, as opposed to what we eat, which is solid. We _liquidate_ an obligation or debt when we settle it or pay it off.

####follow 
**FOLLOW, SUCCEED, ENSUE.**  
_Follow_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _folgian. Succeed_ is compounded of Latin _sub_, next, and _cedere_, to go, meaning to go after. _Ensue_ comes from French _suivre_, Latin _sequi_, to follow.  
_Follow_ and _succeed_ are said of persons and things; _ensue_, of things only: _follow_, in respect of persons, denotes the going in order, in a trace or line; _succeed_ denotes the going or being in the same place immediately after another: many persons may _follow_ one another at the same time; but only one individual properly _succeeds_ another. _Follow_ is taken literally for the motion of the physical body in relation to another; _succeed_ is taken in the moral sense for taking the place of another: people _follow_ one another in a procession, or one _follows_ another to the grave; a king _succeeds_ to a. throne, or a son _succeeds_ to the inheritance of his father. To _follow_ may also be to go in the same course, though not at the same time, as to _follow_ a person to the grave in the sense of dying after him: to _succeed_ is always to go in the place of another, whether living or dead, as one minister of state _succeeds_ another, or a son _succeeds_ his father.  
Persons may _follow_ things, but things only _succeed_ things: as to _follow_ a rule or _follow_ a course of conduct.  
To _follow_, in relation to things, is said either simply of the order in which they go or of such as go by a connection between them; to _succeed_ implies simply to take the place after another; to _ensue_ is to _follow_ by a necessary connection: as in a natural tempest one wave of the sea _follows_ another in rapid succession, so in the moral tempest of political revolutions one mad convulsion is quickly _succeeded_ by another: nothing can _ensue_ from popular commotions but bloodshed and misery. _Follow_ is used in general propositions; _ensue_ is used in specific cases: sin and misery _follow_ each other as cause and effect; quarrels too often _ensue_ from the conversations of violent men who differ either in religion or politics.  
**FOLLOW, PURSUE.** — The idea of going after any object in order to reach or obtain it is common to these terms, but under different circumstances: to _follow_ a person is mostly with a friendly intention; to _pursue_ (see **continue** under [continual](entry://continual)), with a hostile intention: a person _follows_ his fellow-traveller whom he wishes to overtake; the officers of justice _pursue_ the criminal whom they wish to apprehend; so likewise the huntsmen and hunters _follow_ the dogs in the chase; the dogs _pursue_ the hare.  
In application to things, _follow_ is taken more in the passive, and _pursue_ more in the active sense: a man _follows_ the plan of another, and _pursues_ his own plan; he _follows_ his inclinations, and _pursues_ an object.  
**FOLLOW, IMITATE.** — _Follow_ (see above). _Imitate_ is in Latin _imitatus_, participle of _imitare_, from a root also found in _imago._  
Both these terms denote the regulating our actions by something that offers itself to us or is set before us; but we _follow_ that which is either internal or external; we _imitate_ that only which is external: we either _follow_ the dictates of our own minds or the suggestions of others; but we _imitate_ the conduct of others: in regard to external objects, we _follow_ either a rule or an example; but we _imitate_ an example only: we _follow_ the footsteps of our forefathers; we _imitate_ their virtues and their perfections: it is advisable for young persons as closely as possible to _follow_ the good example of those who are older and wiser than themselves; it is the bounden duty of every Christian to _imitate_ the example of our blessed Saviour to the utmost of his power.  
To _follow_ and _imitate_ may both be applied to that which is good or bad: the former to any action, but the latter only to the behavior or the mode of doing anything: we may _follow_ a person in his career of virtue or vice; we _imitate_ his gestures, tone of voice, and the like.  
**FOLLOWER, ADHERENT, PARTISAN.** — _A. follower_ is one who _follows_ a person generally; and _adherent_ is one who _adheres_ to his cause; a _partisan_ is the _follower_ of a party; the _follower_ follows either the person, the interests, or the principles of any one; thus the retinue of a nobleman, or the friends of a statesman, or the friends of any man's opinions, may be styled his _followers;_ but the _adherent_ is that kind of _follower_ who espouses the interests of another, as the _adherents_ of Charles I.: a_ follower_ follows near or at a distance; but the _adherent_ is always near at hand; the _partisan_ hangs on or keeps at a certain distance; the _follower_ follows from various motives; the _adherent_ adheres from a personal motive; the _partisan_, from a partial motive: Charles I. had as many _adherents_ as he had _followers;_ the rebels had as many _partisans_ as they had _adherents._

####folly 
**FOLLY, FOOLERY.**  
_Folly_ is the abstract of foolish, and characterizes the thing; _foolery_, the abstract of fool, and characterizes the person: we may commit an act of _folly_ without being chargeable with weakness or _folly;_ but none are guilty of _fooleries_ who are not themselves fools, either habitually or temporarily: young people are perpetually committing _follies_ if not under proper control; fashionable people lay aside _one foolery_ only to take up another.

####food 
**FOOD, DIET, REGIMEN.**  
_Food_, Anglo-Saxon _foda_, signifying what one eats, comes from a root which appears in Latin _panis_, bread (English _pantry), pasture_, etc., _ρ_ in Latin corresponding to _f_ in the Teutonic languages, as in _pater_ and _father, pedem_ and _foot. Diet_, from _διαιτάω_, to live medicinally, signifies any particular mode of living. _Regimen_, in Latin _regimen_, from _rego_, signifies a system or practice by rule.  
All these terms refer to our living, or that by which we live: _food_ is here the general term; the others are specific. _Food_ specifies no circumstances; whatever is taken to maintain life is _food: diet_ is properly prescribed or regular _food:_ it is the hard lot of some among the poor to obtain with difficulty _food_ and clothing for themselves and their families; an attention to the _diet_ of children is an important branch of their early education. _Food_ is an unqualified term applicable to either man or beast; _diet_ is applied to man only, not merely to individuals in the limited sense, but to the species in the sense of their daily and regular _food. Food_ has also a figurative application which _diet_ has not.  
_Diet_ and _regimen_ are both particular modes of living; but the former respects the quality of _food_, the latter the quantity as well as quality: _diet_ is confined to modes of taking nourishment; _regimen_ often respects the abstinence from _food_, bodily exercise, and whatever may conduce to health: _diet_ is generally the consequence of an immediate prescription from a physician, and during the period of sickness; _regimen_ commonly forms a regular part of a man's system of living: _diet_ is in certain cases of such importance for the restoration of a patient that a single deviation may defeat the best medicine; it is the misfortune of some people to be troubled with diseases from which they cannot get any exemption but by observing a strict _regimen._

####fool 
**FOOL, IDIOT, BUFFOON.**  
_Fool_ comes from Latin _follis_, a wind-bag, and _folles_, puffed cheeks. _Idiot_ comes from the Greek _ίδιώτης_, signifying either a private person or one that is rude and unskilled in the ways of the world. _Buffoon_ comes from French _bouffer_, to puff.  
The _fool_ is either naturally or artificially a _fool;_ the _idiot_ is a natural _fool;_ the _buffoon_ is an artificial _fool:_ whoever violates common sense in his actions is a _fool;_ whoever is unable to act according to common sense is an _idiot;_ whoever intentionally violates common-sense is a _buffoon._  
See also [ninny](entry://ninny)  
**FOOLHARDY, ADVENTUROUS, RASH.** — _Foolhardy_ signifies having the hardihood of a _fool. Adventurous_ signifies ready to _venture. Rash_ comes from a Germanic root signifying quick, sudden.  
_Foolhardy_ expresses more than the _adventurous_, and _adventurous_ than _rash._ The _foolhardy_ man _ventures_ in defiance of consequences: the _adventurous_ man _ventures_ from a love of the arduous and the bold; the _rash_ man _ventures_ for want of thought: courage and boldness become _foolhardihood_ when they lead a person to run a fruitless risk; an _adventurous_ spirit sometimes leads a man into unnecessary difficulties; but it is a necessary accompaniment of greatness. There is not so much design, but there is more violence and impetuosity in _rashness_ than in _foolhardihood:_ the former is the consequence of an ardent temper which will admit of correction by the influence of the judgment; but the latter comprehends the perversion of both the will and the judgment. An infidel is _foolhardy_, who risks his future salvation for the mere gratification of his pride; Alexander was an _adventurous_ prince who delighted in enterprises in proportion as they presented difficulties; he was likewise a _rash_ prince, as was evinced by his jumping into the river Cydnus while he was hot, and by his leaping over the wall of Oxydracæ and exposing himself singly to the attack of the enemy.

####forbid 
**FORBID, PROHIBIT, INTERDICT.**  
The _for_ in _forbid_, like the German _ver_, is negative, signifying to bid not to do. The _pro_ in _prohibit_, and _inter_ in _interdict_, have both a similarly negative sense: the former verb, from _habere_, to have, signifies to have or hold that a thing shall not be done, to restrain from doing; the latter, from _dicere_, to say, signifies to say that a thing shall not be done.  
_Forbid_ is the ordinary term; _prohibit_ is the judicial term; _interdict_ the moral term. To _forbid_ is a direct and personal act; to _prohibit_ is an indirect action that operates by means of extended influence: both imply the exercise of power or authority by any person; but the former is more applicable to the power of private persons, and the latter to the authority of government. A parent _forbids_ his child marrying when he thinks proper: the government _prohibits_ the use of spirituous liquors. _Interdict_ is a species of _forbidding_ applied to more serious concerns, as to _interdict_ the use of any one strong drink. To _forbid_ or _interdict_ is opposed to command; to _prohibit_, to allow. As nothing is _forbidden_ to Christians which is good and just in itself, so nothing is commanded that is hurtful and unjust. As no one is _prohibited_ in our own country from writing that which can send to the improvement of mankind, so on the other hand he is not allowed to indulge his private malignity by the publication of injurious personalities.  
_Forbid_ and _interdict_, as personal acts, are properly applicable to persons only, but by an improper application are extended to things; _prohibit_, however, in the general sense of restraining, is applied with equal propriety to things as to persons: shame _forbids_ us doing a things law, authority, and the like, _prohibit_  
See also [ban](entry://ban)

####force 
**FORCE, VIOLENCE.**  
Both these terms imply an exertion of strength; but the former in a much less degree than the latter. _Force_ (see [compel](entry://compel)) is ordinarily employed to supply the want of a proper will; _violence_, in Latin _violentia_, from _vis_, and the Greek, _βία_, strength, is used to counteract an opposing will. The arms of justice must exercise _force_ in order to bring offenders to a proper account; one nation exercises _violence_ against another in the act of carrying on war. _Force_ is mostly conformable to reason and equity; _violence_ is always resorted to for the attainment of that which is unattainable by law. All who are invested with authority have occasion to use _force_ at certain times to subdue the unruly will of those who should submit: _violence_ and rapine are inseparable companions; a robber could not subsist by the latter without exercising the former.  
In an extended and figurative application to things, these terms convey the same general idea of exerting strength. That is said to have _force_ that acts with _force;_ and that to have _violence_ that acts with _violence._ A word, an expression, or a remark has _force_ or is_ forcible;_ a disorder, a passion, a sentiment, has _violence_ or is _violent. Force_ is always something desirable; _violence_ is always something hurtful. We ought to listen to arguments which have _force_ in them; we endeavor to correct the _violence_ of all angry passions.

####forefathers 
**FOREFATHERS, PROGENITORS, ANCESTORS.**  
_Forefathers_ signifies our _fathers before_ us, and includes our immediate parents. _Progenitors_, from _pro_ and _gignere_, to beget, signifies those begotten before us, exclusive of our immediate parents. _Ancestors_, contracted from _antecessors_, or those going before, is said of those from whom we are remotely descended. _Forefathers_ is a partial and familiar term for the preceding branches of any family.  
_Progenitors_ is a higher term in the same sense applied to families of distinction: we speak of the _forefathers_ of a peasant, but the _progenitors_ of a nobleman.  
_Forefathers_ and _progenitors_, but particularly the latter, are said mostly of individuals, and respect the regular line of succession in a family; _ancestors_ is employed collectively as well as individually and regards simply the order of succession: we may speak of the _ancestors_ of a nation as well as of any particular person.

####forerunner 
**FORERUNNER, PRECURSOR, MESSENGER, HARBINGER.**  
_Forerunner_ and _precursor_ signify literally the same thing, namely, one _running before;_ but the term _forerunner_ is properly applied only to one who runs before to any spot to communicate intelligence; and it is figuratively applied to things which in their nature, or from a natural connection, precede others; _precursor_ is only employed in this figurative sense: thus imprudent speculations are said to be the _forerunners_ of a man's ruin; the ferment which took place in men's minds was the _precursor_ of the revolution.  
_Messenger_ signifies literally one bearing _messages:_ and _harbinger_, from the Old French _herberger_, Old High German _heri-berga_, from _heri_, an army, and _bergan_, to shelter, signified, one who provided a shelter for an army. Both terms are employed for persons: but the _messenger_ states what has been or is; the _harbinger_, announces what is to be. Our Saviour was the _messenger_ of glad tidings to all mankind: the prophets were the _harbingers_ of the Messiah. A _messenger_ may be employed on different offices; a _harbinger_ is a _messenger_ who acts in a specific office. The angels are represented as _messengers_ on different occasions. John the Baptist was the _harbinger_ of our Saviour, who prepared the way of the Lord. They are both applied figuratively to other objects. 

####foresight 
**FORESIGHT, FORETHOUGHT, FORECAST, PREMEDITATION.**  
_Foresight_, from seeing before, and _forethought_, from thinking beforehand, denote the simple act of the mind in seeing a thing before it happens: _forecast_, from casting the thoughts onward, signifies coming at the knowledge of a thing beforehand by means of calculation: _premeditation_, from _meditate_, signifies obtaining the same knowledge by force of meditating, reflecting deeply. _Foresight_ and _forethought_ are general and indefinite terms; we employ them on either ordinary or extraordinary occasions; but _forethought_ is, of the two, the most familiar term; _forecast_ and _premeditation_, mostly in the latter case: all business requires _foresight;_ state concerns require _forecast; foresight_ and _forecast_ respect what is to happen; they are the operations of the mind in calculating futurity: _premeditation_ respects what is to be said or done; it is a preparation of the thoughts and designs for action: by _foresight_ and _forecast_ we guard against evils and provide for contingencies; by _premeditation_ we guard against errors of conduct. A man betrays his want of _foresight_ who does not provide against losses in trade; he shows his want of _forecast_ who does not provide against old age; he shows his want of _premeditation_ who acts or speaks on the impulse of the moment: the man, therefore, who does a wicked act without _premeditation_ lessens his guilt. 

####forest 
**FOREST, CHASE, PARK** are all habitations for animals of venery; but the _forest_ is of the first magnitude and importance, it being a franchisa and the property of the king; the _chase_ and _park_ may be either public, or private property. The _forest_ is so formed of wood, and covers such an extent of ground, that it may be the haunt of wild beasts; of this description are the _forests_ in Germany: the _chase_ is an indefinite and open space that is allotted expressly for the _chase_ of particular animals, such as deer; the _park_ is an enclosed space that serves for the preservation of domestic animals. 

####foretell 
**FORETELL, PREDICT, PROPHESY, PROGNOSTICATE.**  
To _foretell_ is compounded of _fore_ and _tell; predict_ comes from _prœ_, before, and _dicere_, to say; _prophesy_, in French _prophétiser_, Latin _prophetiso_, Greek _προφήτης_, from _προ_, Latin _pro_, before, and _φημί_, to speak, meaning to speak before the event, conveys the same idea; _prognosticate_, from the Greek _προγιγνώσκειν_, to know beforehand, to bode or imagine to one's self beforehand, denotes the action of feeling or knowing, rather than speaking of things to come.  
_Foretell_ is the most general in its sense and familiar in its application; we may _foretell_ common events, although we cannot _predict_ or _prophesy_ anything important: to _foretell_ is an ordinary gift; one _foretells_ by a simple calculation or guess: to _predict_ and _prophesy_ are extraordinary gifts; one _predicts_ by a supernatural power, real or supposed; one _prophesies_ by means of inspiration. Men of discernment and experience easily _foretell_ the events of undertakings which fall under their notice. The priests among the heathens, like the astrologers and conjurers of more modern times, pretended to _predict_ events that affected nations and empires. The gift of _prophecy_ was one among the number of the supernatural gifts communicated to the primitive Christians by the Holy Ghost.  
_Prediction_, as a noun, is employed for both the verbs _foretell_ and _predict;_ it is, therefore, a term of less value than _prophecy._ We speak of a _prediction_ being verified and a _prophecy_ fulfilled: the _predictions_ of almanac-makers respecting the weather are as seldom verified as the _prophecies_ of visionaries and enthusiasts are fulfilled respecting the death of princes or the affairs of governments.  
To _prognosticate_ is an act of the understanding; it is guided by outward symptoms, as a rule; it is only stimulated, and not guided, by outward objects; a physician _prognosticates_ the crisis of a disorder by the symptoms discoverable in the patient.

####forgetfulness 
**FORGETFULNESS, OBLIVION.**  
_forgetfulness_ characterizes the person or that which is personal; _oblivion_, the state of the thing: the former refers to him who _forgets_, the latter to that which is _forgotten:_ we blame a person for his _forgetfulness;_ but we sometimes bury things in _oblivion._

####forgive 
**FORGIVE, ABSOLVE, PARDON, REMIT.**  
_Forgive_, Anglo-Saxon _forgefan_, compounded of the privative _for_ and _gifan_, Modern English _give_, and _pardon_ (see [excuse](entry://excuse)) both signify not to give the punishment that is due, to relax from the rigor of justice in demanding retribution. _Forgive_ is the familiar term; _pardon_ is adapted to the serious style. Individuals _forgive_ one another personal offences; they _pardon_ offences against law and morals: the former is an act of Christian charity: the latter an act of clemency: the former is an act that is confined to no condition; the latter is peculiarly the act of a superior. He who has the right of being offended has an opportunity of _forgiving_ the offender; he who has the authority of punishing the offence may _pardon. Pardon_, when compared with _remission_, is the consequence of offence; it respects principally the person offending; it depends upon him who is offended; it produces reconciliation when it is sincerely granted and sincerely demanded. _Remission_ is the consequence of the crime; it has more particular regard to the punishment; it is granted by either the prince or the magistrates; it arrests the execution of justice. _Remission_, like _pardon_, is peculiarly applicable to the sinner with regard to his Maker. _Absolution_ is taken in no other sense: it is the consequence of the fault or the sin, and properly concerns the state of the culprit; it properly loosens him from the tie with which he is bound; it is pronounced either by the civil judge or by the ecclesiastical minister; and it re-establishes the accused or the penitent in the rights of innocence.

####form 
**FORM, FIGURE, CONFORMATION.**  
_Form_, in Latin _forma_, signifies properly the life within which gives shape and individuality to anything. _Figure_ signifies the image feigned or conceived. _Conformation_, in French _conformation_, in Latin _conformatio_, from _conform_, signifies the image disposed or put together.  
_Form_ is the generic term; _figure_ and _conformation_ are special terms. The _form_ is the work either of nature or art: it results from the arrangement of the parts: the _figure_ is the work of design: it includes the general contour or outline: the _conformation_ includes such a disposition of the parts of the body as is adapted for performing certain functions. _Form_ is the property of every substance; and the artificial _form_ approaches nearest to perfection as it is most natural; the _figure_ is the fruit of the imagination; it is the representation of the actual _form_ that belongs to things; it is more or less just as it approaches to the _form_ of the thing itself: _conformation_ is said only with regard to animal bodies; nature renders it more or less suitable according to the accidental concurrence of physical causes. The erect _form_, of man is one of the distinguishing marks of his superiority over every other terrestrial being: the human _figure_ when well painted is an object of admiration: the turn of the mind is doubtless influenced by the _conformation_ of the organs. A person's _form_ is said to be handsome or ugly, common or uncommon, his _figure_ to be correct or incorrect; a _conformation_, to be good or bad. Heathens have worshipped the Deity under various _forms:_ mathematical _figures_ are the only true _figures_ with which we are acquainted: the craniologist affects to judge of characters by the _conformation_ of the skull.  
_Form_ and _figure_ are used in a moral application, although _conformation_ is not. We speak of adopting a _form_ of faith, a _form_ of words, a _form_ of godliness; cutting a showy, a dismal, or ridiculous _figure._  
**FORM, FASHION, MOULD, SHAPE.** — To _form_ is to put into a _form_, which is here as before the generic term: to _fashion_ is to put into a particular or distinct _form;_ to _mould_ is to put into a set _form;_ to _shape_ is to _form_ simply as it respects the exterior. As everything respects a _form_ when it receives existence, so to _form_ conveys the idea of producing. When we wish to represent a thing as _formed_ in any distinct or remarkable way, we may speak of it _as fashioned._ God _formed_ man out of the dust of the ground; He_ fashioned_ him after His own image. When we wish to represent a thing as _formed_ according to a precise rule, we should say it was _moulded;_ thus the habits of a man are _moulded_ at the will of a superior. When we wish to represent a thing as receiving the accidental qualities which distinguish it from others, we talk of _shaping_ it: the potter _shapes_ the clay; the milliner _shapes_ a bonnet; a man _shapes_ his actions to the humors of another. See also [make](entry://make)  
**FORM, COMPOSE, CONSTITUTE.** — _Form_ is a generic and indefinite term, signifying to give a _form._ To _compose_ and _constitute_ are modes of forming. These words may be employed either to designate modes of action or to characterize things. Things may be _formed_ either by persons or things; they are _composed_ and _constituted_ only by conscious agents: thus persons _form_ things, or things _form_ one another: thus we _form_ a circle, or the reflection of the light after rain _forms_ a rainbow. Persons _compose_ and _constitute:_ thus a musician _composes_ a piece of music, or men _constitute_ laws.  
To _form_, in regard to persons, is simply to put into a form; to _compose_ is to put together into a form; and to _constitute_ is to make to stand together in a form; to _form_, therefore, does not qualify the action: one _forms_ a thing without defining how, whether at once or by degrees, whether with one or several materials; to _compose_ and _constitute_ are both modes of forming by the help of several materials, with device and contrivance; _compose_ is said of that which only requires to be put together; _constitute_, of that to which a certain degree of stability must be given. God _formed_ man, man _forms_ a cup or a vessel; he _composes_ a book; he _constitutes_ offices, bodies politic, and the like.  
When employed to characterize things, _form_ signifies simply to have a _form_, be it either simple or complex; _compose_ and _constitute_ are said only of those things which have complex _forms;_ the former as respecting the material, the latter the essential parts of an object: thus we may say that an object _forms_ a circle, or a semicircle, or the segment of a circle: a society is _composed_ of individuals; but law and order _constitute_ the essence of society: so letters and syllables _compose_ a word; but sense is essential to _constitute_ a word.  
**FORM, CEREMONY, RITE, OBSERVANCE.** — _Form_ (see above). _Ceremony_, in Latin _ceremonia_, signifies a formal celebration. _Rite_, Latin _ritus_, means a going; a way, a way of doing, from a root _ri_, meaning to flow, to move. _Observance_ signifies the thing observed, from Latin _observare_, to heed, to observe.  
All these terms are employed with regard to particular modes of action in civil society. _Form_ is here, as in the preceding sections, the most general in its sense and application; _ceremony, rite_, and _observance_ are particular kinds of _form_, suited to particular occasions. _Form_, in its distinct application, respects all determinate modes of acting and speaking that are adopted by society at large in every transaction of life; _ceremony_ respects those _forms_ of outward behavior which are made the expressions of respect and deference; _rite_ and _observance_ are applied to national _ceremonies_ in matters of religion. A certain _form_ is requisite for the sake of order, method, and decorum, in every social matter, whether in affairs of state, in a court of law, in a place of worship, or in the private intercourse of friends. So long as distinctions are admitted in society, and men are agreed to express their sentiments of regard and respect to one another, it will be necessary to preserve the _ceremonies_ of politeness which have been established. Administering oaths by the magistrate is a necessary _form_ in law; kissing the king's hand is a _ceremony_ practiced at court.  
As far as _form, ceremonies, rites_, and _observances_ respect religion, the first is used in the most universal and unqualified sense in respect to religion generally or any particular _form:_ the second may be said either of an individual or a community; the third only of a community; and the last, more properly, of an individual either in public or in private. There can be no religion without some _form_, but there may be different _forms_ which are equally good. Every country has adopted certain _rites_ founded upon its peculiar religious faith, and prescribed certain _observances_ by which individuals can make a public profession of their faith: baptism is one _rite_ of initiation into the Christian church; kneeling at prayer is a _ceremony_, prayer itself is an _observance._  
**FORMAL, CEREMONIOUS, CEREMONIAL.** — _Formal_ and _ceremonious_, from _form_ and _ceremony_, are either taken in an indifferent sense with respect to what contains _form_ and _ceremony_, or in a bad sense, expressing the excess of _form_ and _ceremony._ A person expects to have a _formal_ dismissal before he considers himself as dismissed; people of fashion pay one another _ceremonious_ visits, by way of keeping up a distant intercourse.  
_Ceremonial_ is employed in the sense of appertaining to prescribed _ceremonies;_ and _formal_ implies appertaining to prescribed forms in public matters, as _formal_ communications from one government to another: it is the business of the church to regulate the _ceremonial_ part of religion.  
_Ceremonious_ was formerly used in the same sense as _ceremonial. Formal_, in the bad sense, is opposed to easy: _ceremonious_, to the cordial. A _formal_ carriage prevents a person from indulging himself in the innocent familiarities of friendly intercourse; _ceremonious_ carriage puts a stop to all hospitality and kindness. Princes, in their _formal_ intercourse with one another, know nothing of the pleasures of society; _ceremonious_ visitants give and receive entertainments without tasting any of the enjoyments which flow from the reciprocity of kind offices.

####formerly 
**FORMERLY, IN TIMES PAST or OLD TIMES, DAYS OF YORE, ANCIENTLY or ANCIENT TIMES.**  
_Formerly_ supposes a less remote period than _in times past:_ and that less remote than _in days of yore_ and _anciently._ The first two may be said of what happens within the age of man; the last two are extended to many generations and ages. Any individual may use the word _formerly_ with regard to himself: thus, we enjoyed our health better _formerly_ than now. An old man may speak of _times past_, as when he says he does not enjoy himself as he did _in times past. Old times, days of yore_, and _anciently_ are more applicable to nations than to individuals; and all these express different degrees of _remoteness._ "With respect to our present period, the age of Queen Elizabeth may be called _old times;_ the days of Alfred, and, still later, the _days of yore:_ the earliest period in which Britain is mentioned may be termed _ancient times._ See also [once](entry://once)

####formidable 
**FORMIDABLE, DREADFUL, TERRIBLE, SHOCKING.**  
_Formidable_ is applied to that which is apt to excite fear (see [apprehend](entry://apprehend)). _Dreadful_, to what is calculated to excite dread; _terrible_ (see [alarm](entry://alarm)), to that which excites _terror;_ and _shocking_ (from Middle English _shokken_, to jolt) is applied to that which violently shakes or agitates (see AGITATE). The _formidable_ acts neither suddenly nor violently; the _dreadful_ may act violently but not suddenly: thus the appearance of an army may be _formidable;_ but that of a field of battle is _dreadful._ The _terrible_ and _shocking_ act both suddenly and violently; but the former acts both on the senses and on the imagination, the latter on the moral feelings: thus, the glare of a tiger's eye is _terrible;_ the unexpected news of a friend's death is _shocking._

####forsake 
See [abandon](entry://abandon)

####forsaken 
**FORSAKEN, FORLORN, DESTITUTE.**  
To be _forsaken_ is to be deprived of the company and assistance of those we have looked to; to be _forlorn_, Anglo-Saxon _forloren_ (German _verloren)_, past participle of _forleosan_, to lose entirely, signifying lost, is to be _forsaken_ in time of difficulty, to be without a guide in an unknown road; to be _destitute_, from the Latin _destitutus_, from Latin _de_, away, and _statuere_, to place, meaning taken away from, is to be deprived of the first necessaries of life. To be _forsaken_ is a partial situation; to be _forlorn_ and _destitute_ is a permanent condition. We may be _forsaken_ by a fellow-traveller on the road; we are _forlorn_ when we get into a deserted path with no one to direct us; we are _destitute_ when we have no means of subsistence, nor the prospect of obtaining the means. It is particularly painful to be _forsaken_ by the friend of our youth and the sharer of our fortunes; the orphan who is left to travel the road of life without counsellor or friend is, of all others, in the most_ forlorn_ condition; if to this be added poverty, his misery is aggravated by his becoming _destitute._

####forswear 
**FORSWEAR, PERJURE, SUBORN.**  
_Forswear_ is Anglo-Saxon; _perjure_ is Latin; the prepositions _for_ and _per_ are both privative, and the words signify literally to swear contrary to the truth; this is, however, not their only distinction: to _forswear_ is applied to all kinds of oaths; to _perjure_ is employed only for such oaths as have been administered by the civil magistrate. A soldier _forswears_ himself who breaks his oath of allegiance by desertion; and a subject _forswears_ himself who takes an oath of allegiance to his sovereign which he afterward violates; a man _perjures_ himself in a court of law who swears to the truth of that which he knows to be false. _Forswear_ is used only in the proper sense: _perjure_ may be used figuratively with regard to lover's vows; he who deserts his mistress to whom he has pledged his affections is a _perjured_ man.  
_Forswear_ and _perjure_ are the acts of individuals; _suborn_, from the Latin sub, secretly, and _ornare_, to adorn, to enrich, meaning to enrich secretly, to bribe, and hence to make to _forswear;_ a _perjured_ man has all the guilt upon himself; but he who is _suborned_ shares his guilt with the _suborner._

####fortunate 
**FORTUNATE, LUCKY, FORTUITOUS, PROSPEROUS, SUCCESSFUL.**  
_Fortunate_ signifies having _fortune_ (see [chance](entry://chance)). _Lucky_ is the adjective corresponding to _luck_, which is not found in Anglo-Saxon, but is a late borrowing from Dutch and German. (Compare German _Glück.) Fortuitous_, from _fors_, chance, signifies according to chance. _Prosperous_ (see [flourish](entry://flourish)). _Successful_ signifies full of _success_, enabled to _succeed._  
The _fortunate_ and _lucky_ are both applied to that which happens without the control of man; but the latter, which is a collateral term, describes the capricious goddess _Fortune_ in her most freakish humors, while _fortunate_ represents her in her more sober mood: in other words, the _fortunate_ is more according to the ordinary course of things; the _lucky_ is something sudden, unaccountable, and singular: a circumstance is said to be _fortunate_ which turns up suitably to our purpose; it is said to be _lucky_ when it comes upon us unexpectedly, at the moment that it is wanted: hence we speak of a man as _fortunate_ in his business and the ordinary concerns of life, but _lucky_ in the lottery or in games of chance: a _fortunate_ year will make up for the losses of the past year; a _lucky_ hit may repair the ruined spendthrift's _fortune_, only to tempt him to still greater extravagances.  
_Fortunate_ and _lucky_ are applied to particular circumstances of good _fortune_ and _luck_, but _fortuitous_ is employed only in matters of chance generally and indifferently.  
_Prosperous_ and _successful_ seem to exclude the idea of what is _fortuitous_, although _prosperity_ and _success_ are both greatly aided by good _fortune. Fortunate_ and _lucky_ are applied as much to the removal of evil as to the attainment of good; _prosperous_ and _successful_ are concerned only in what is good, or esteemed as such: we may be _fortunate_ in making our escape; we are _prosperous_ in the acquirement of wealth. _Fortunate_ is employed for single circumstances; _prosperous_ only for a train of circumstances; a man may be _fortunate_ in meeting with the approbation of a superior; he is _prosperous_ in his business. _Prosperity_ is extended to whatever is the object of our wishes in this world; _success_ is that degree of _prosperity_ which immediately attends our endeavors; wealth, honors, children, and all outward circumstances constitute _prosperity;_ the attainment of any object constitutes _success:_ the _fortunate_ and _lucky_ man can lay no claim to merit, because they preclude the idea of exertion; the _prosperous_ and _successful_ man may claim a share of merit proportioned to the exertion.  
The epithet _prosperous_ may be applied to those things which promote _prosperity_ or ultimate success.

####foster 
**FOSTER, CHERISH, HARBOR, INDULGE.**  
To _foster_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _fostor_, nourishment, allied to _foda_, food; to _cherish_, through French from Latin _carus_, dear, is to hold affection; to _harbor_, from a _harbor_ or _haven_, is to provide with a shelter and protection; to _indulge_ comes from Latin _indulgere_, to be courteous to, of unknown origin. These terms are all employed here in the moral acceptation, to express the idea of giving nourishment to an object. To _foster_ in the mind is to keep with care and positive endeavors; as when one _fosters_ prejudices by encouraging everything which favors them: to _cherish_ in the mind is to hold dear or set a value upon; as when one _cherishes_ good sentiments by dwelling upon them with inward satisfaction: to _harbor_ is to allow room in the mind, and is generally taken in the worst sense for giving admission to that which ought to be excluded; as when one _harbors_ resentment by permitting it to have a resting-place in the heart: to _indulge_ in the mind is to give the whole mind to it, to make it the chief source of pleasure: as when one _indulges_ an affection, by making the will and the outward conduct bend to its gratification. 

####foul 
See [squalid](entry://squalid)

####found 
**FOUND, GROUND, REST, BUILD.**  
_Found_, in French _fonder_, Latin _fundo_, comes from _fundus_, the ground, and, like the verb _ground_, properly signifies to make firm in the _ground_, to make the _ground_ the support. To _found_ implies the exercise of art and contrivance in making a support; to _ground_ signifies to lay a thing so deep that it may not totter; it is merely in the moral sense that they are here considered, as the verb to _ground_ with this signification is never used otherwise. _Found_ is applied to outward circumstances; _ground_, to what passes inwardly: a man _founds_ his charge against another upon certain facts that are come to his knowledge; he _grounds_ his belief upon the most substantial evidence: a man should be cautious not to make any accusations which are not well _founded_, nor to indulge any expectations which are not well _grounded:_ monarchs commonly _found_ their claims to a throne upon the right of primogeniture; Christians _ground_ their hopes of immortality on the word of God. To _found_ and _ground_ are said of things which demand the full exercise of the mental powers; to _rest_ is an action of less importance: whatever is _founded_ requires and has the utmost support; whatever is _rested_ is more by the will of the individual: a man _founds_ his reasoning upon some unequivocal fact; he _rests_ his assertion upon mere hearsay. The words _found, ground_, and _rest_ have always an immediate reference to the thing that supports; to _build_ has an especial reference to that which is supported, to the superstructure that is raised: we should not say that a person _founds_ an hypothesis without adding something, as observations, experiments, and the like, upon which it was _founded;_ but we may speak of his simply _building_ systems, supposing them to be the mere fruit of his distempered imagination; or we may say that a system of astronomy has been _built_ upon the opinion of Copernicus respecting the motion of the earth.  
See also [institute](entry://institute)  
**FOUNDATION, GROUND, BASIS.** — _Foundation_ and _ground_ derive their meaning and application from the preceding article: a report is said to be without any _foundation_ which has taken its rise in mere conjecture or in some arbitrary cause independent of all fact; a man's suspicion is said to be without _ground_ which is not supported by the shadow of external evidence: _unfounded_ clamors are frequently raised against the measures of government; _groundless_ jealousies frequently arise between families to disturb the harmony of their intercourse.  
_Foundation_ and basis may be compared with each other, either in the proper or the improper signification: both _foundation_ and basis are the lowest parts of any structure; but the former lies under _ground_, the latter stands above: the _foundation_ supports some large and artificially erected pile; the _basis_ supports a simple pillar: hence we speak of the _foundation_ of St. Paul's, and the _base_ or _basis_ of the Monument.  
This distinction is likewise preserved in the moral application of the terms: disputes have too often their _foundation_ in frivolous circumstances; treaties have commonly their _basis_ in some acknowledged general principle; with governments that are at war pacific negotiations may be commenced on the _basis_ of the _uti possidetis._

####fragile 
**FRAGILE, FRAIL, BRITTLE.**  
_Fragile_ and _frail_, in French _frêle_, both come from the Latin _fragilis_, signifying breakable; but the former is used in the proper sense only, and the latter more generally in the improper sense: man, corporeally considered, is a _fragile_ creature, his frame is composed of _fragile_ materials; mentally considered, he is a _fragile_ creature, for he is liable to every sort of _frailty. Brittle_ comes from the Anglo-Saxon _breotan_, to break, and means breakable; but it conveys a stronger idea of this quality than _fragile:_ the latter applies to whatever will break from the effects of time; _brittle_ to that which will not bear a temporary violence: in this sense all the works of men are _fragile_, and, in fact, all sublunary things; but glass, stone, and ice are peculiarly denominated _brittle._

####frame 
**FRAME, TEMPER, TEMPERAMENT, CONSTITUTION.**  
_Frame_, Anglo-Saxon _framian_, to further, is allied to _from_, the preposition, and means literally the outside of anything; it is also allied to _fram_, meaning strong, and German _fromm_, good; it is applied to man physically or mentally, as denoting that constituent portion of him which seems to hold the rest together; which by an extension of the metaphor is likewise put for the whole contents, the whole body, or the whole mind. _Temper_ and _temperament_, in Latin _temperamentum_, from _temperare_, to govern or dispose, signify the particular modes of being disposed or organized. _Constitution_, from _constitute_ or appoint, signifies the particular mode of being _constituted_ or formed.  
_Frame_, when applied to the body, is taken in its most universal sense: as when we speak of the _frame_ being violently agitated, or the human _frame_ being wonderfully constructed: when applied to the mind, it will admit either of a general or restricted signification. Temper, which is applicable only to the mind, is taken in the general or particular state of the individual. The _frame_ comprehends either the whole body of mental powers or the particular disposition of those powers in individuals; the _temper_ comprehends the general or particular state of feeling as well as thinking in the individual. The mental _frame_ which receives any violent concussion is liable to derangement; it is necessary for those who govern to be well acquainted with the _temper_ of those whom they govern. By reflection on the various attributes of the Divine Being, a man may easily bring his mind into a _frame_ of devotion: by the indulgence of a fretful, repining _temper_, a man destroys his own peace of mind and offends his Maker.  
_Temperament_ and _constitution_ mark the general state of the individual; the former comprehends a mixture of the physical and mental; the latter has a purely physical application. A man with a warm _temperament_ owes his warmth of character to the rapid impetus of the blood; a man with a delicate _constitution_ is exposed to great fluctuations in his health; the whole _frame_ of a new-born infant is peculiarly tender. Men of fierce _tempers_ are to be found in all nations; men of sanguine _tempers_ are more frequent in warm climates; the _constitutions_ of females are more tender than those of the male, and their _frames_ are altogether more susceptible.

####frank 
**FRANK, CANDID, INGENUOUS, FREE, OPEN, PLAIN.**  
_Frank_, in French _franc_, Old High German _franko_, a Frank, from a weapon, was originally the name of a Germanic tribe which gave its name to France; the word signified a free-born German, as distinguished from those whom the Germans conquered, and hence the liberal and fearless manners of the man who calls no man master. _Candid_ (for derivation see [candid](entry://candid)). _Ingenuous_ comes from the Latin _ingenuus_, which signifies literally free-born, as distinguished from the _liberti_, who were afterward made _free:_ hence the term has been employed by a figure of speech to denote nobleness of birth or character. _Free_, Anglo-Saxon _freo_, originally meant dear, and was applied to the free-born children of a household, distinguished from the child-slaves. Compare Latin _liberi_, free, which also meant children. _Open_ (see [candid](entry://candid)). _Plain_ (see [apparent](entry://apparent)).  
All these terms convey the idea of a readiness to communicate and be communicated with; they are all opposed to concealment, but under different circumstances. The _frank_ man is under no constraint; his thoughts and feelings are both set at ease, and his lips are ever ready to give utterance to the dictates of his heart; he has no reserve: the _candid_ man has nothing to conceal; he speaks without regard to self-interest or any partial motive; he speaks nothing but the truth: the _ingenuous_ man throws off all disguise; he scorns all artifice and brings everything to light; he speaks the whole truth. _Frankness_ is acceptable in the general transactions of society; it inspires confidence and invites communication: _candor_ is of peculiar use in matters of dispute; it serves the purposes of equity and invites to conciliation: _ingenuousness_ is most wanted where there is most to conceal; it courts favor and kindness by an acknowledgment of that which is against itself.  
_Frankness_ is associated with unpolished manners, and frequently appears in men of no rank or education; sailors have commonly a deal of _frankness_ about them: _candor_ is the companion of uprightness; it must be accompanied with some refinement, as it acts in cases where nice discriminations are made: _ingenuousness_ is the companion of a noble and elevated spirit: it exists most frequently in the unsophisticated period of youth. _Frankness_ displays itself in the outward behavior; we speak of a _frank_ air and _frank_ manner: _candor_ displays itself in the language which we adopt and the sentiments we express; we speak of a _candid_ statement, a _candid_ reply: _ingenuousness_ shows itself in all the words, looks, or actions; we speak of an _ingenuous_ countenance, an _ingenuous_ acknowledgment, an _ingenuous_ answer.  
_Free, open_, and _plain_ have not so high an office as the first three; _free_ and _open_ may be taken either in a good, bad, or indifferent sense; but seldomer in the first than in the last two senses.  
The _frank, free_, and _open_ men all speak without constraint; but the _frank_ man is not impertinent, like the _free_ man, nor indiscreet, like the _open_ man. The _frank_ man speaks only of what concerns himself; the _free_ man speaks of what concerns others: a _frank_ man may confess his own faults or inadvertencies; the _free_ man corrects those which he sees in another: the_ frank_ man opens his heart from the warmth of his nature; the _free_ man opens his mind from the conceit of his temper, and the _open_ man says all he knows and thinks, from the inconsiderate levity of his temper.  
_Plainness_, the last quality to be here noticed, is a virtue which, though of the humbler order, is not to be despised: it is sometimes employed, like _freedom_, in the task of giving counsel; but it does not convey the idea of anything unauthorized either in matter or manner. A _free_ counsellor is more ready to display his own superiority than to direct the wanderer in his way; he rather aggravates faults than instructs how to amend them; he seems more like a supercilious enemy than a friendly monitor: the _plain_ man is _free_ from these faults: he speaks _plainly_ but truly; he gives no false coloring to his speech; it is not calculated to offend, and it may serve for improvement: it is the part of a true friend to be _plain_ with another whom he sees in imminent danger. A _free_ speaker is in danger of being hated; a _plain_ dealer must at least be respected.

####freak 
**FREAK, WHIM.**  
_Freak_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _free_, meaning bold, rash. _Whim_ is a Scandinavian word, allied to Icelandic _hvima_, to wander with the eyes, to be foolish. _Freak_ has more of childishness and humor than boldness in it, a _whim_ more of eccentricity than of childishness. Fancy and fortune are both said to have their _freaks_, as they both deviate most widely in their movements from all rule; but _whims_ are at most but singular deviations of the mind from its ordinary and even course. Females are most liable to be seized with _freaks_, which are in their nature sudden and not to be calculated upon: men are apt to indulge themselves in _whims_ which are in their nature strange and often laughable. We should call it a _freak_ for a female to put on the habit of a male, and so accoutred to sally forth into the streets: we term it a _whim_ in a man who takes a resolution never to shave himself any more. 

####free 
**FREE, LIBERAL.**  
In the section on [frank](entry://frank), _free_ is considered only as it respects communication by words; in the present case it respects actions and sentiments. In all its acceptations, _free_ is a term of dispraise, and _liberal_ that of commendation. To be _free_ signifies to act or think at will; to be _liberal_ is to act according to the dictates of an enlarged heart and an enlightened mind. A clown or a fool may be _free_ with his money, and may squander it away to please his humor or gratify his appetite; but the nobleman and the wise man will be _liberal_ in rewarding merit, in encouraging industry, and in promoting whatever can contribute to the ornament, the prosperity, and improvement of his country.  
A man who is _free_ in his sentiments thinks as he pleases; the man who is _liberal_ thinks according to the extent of his knowledge. The _free_thinking man is wise in his own conceit, he despises the opinions of others; the _liberal-minded_ thinks modestly on his own personal attainments, and builds upon the wisdom of others.  
**FREE, SET FREE, DELIVER, LIBERATE.** — To _free_ is properly to make _free_, in distinction from _set free;_ the first is employed in what concerns ourselves, and the second in that which concerns another. A man _frees_ himself from an engagement; he _sets_ another _free_ from his engagement: we _free_, or _set_ ourselves _free_, from that which has been imposed upon us by ourselves or by circumstances; we are _delivered_ or _liberated_ from that which others have imposed upon us; the former from evils in general, the latter from the evil of confinement. I _free_ myself from a burden; I _set_ my own slave _free_ from his slavery; I _deliver_ another man's slave from a state of bondage; I _liberate_ a man from prison. A man _frees_ an estate from rent, service, taxes, and all encumbrances; a king _sets_ his subjects _free_ from certain imposts or tributes, he _delivers_ them from a foreign yoke, or he _liberates_ those who have been taken in war.  
See also [emancipate](entry://emancipate)  
**FREE, FAMILIAR.** — _Free_ has already been considered as it respects words, actions and sentiments; in the present case it is coupled with _familiarity_, inasmuch as they respect the outward behavior or conduct in general of men one to another. To be _free_ is to be disengaged from all the constraints which the ceremonies of social intercourse impose; to be _familiar_ is to be upon the footing of a _familiar_, of a relative, or one of the same family.  
Neither of these terms can be admitted as unexceptionable; _freedom_ is authorized only by particular circumstances and within certain limitations; _familiarity_ sometimes shelters itself under the sanction of long, close, and friendly intercourse. _Free_ is a term of much more extensive import than _familiar;_ a man may be _free_ toward another in a thousand ways; but he is _familiar_ toward him only in his manners and address. A man who is _free_ makes _free_ with everything as if it were his own; a _familiar_ man only wants to share with another, and to stand upon an equal footing in his social intercourse. No man can be _free_ without being in danger of infringing upon what belongs to another, nor _familiar_ without being in danger of obtruding himself to the annoyance of others, or of degrading himself.  
**FREE, EXEMPT.** — _Free_ (see preceding terms). _Exempt_, in Latin _exemptus_, from _ex_, out, and _emere_, to take, signifies set out or disengaged from anything.  
The condition and not the conduct of men is here considered. _Freedom_ is either accidental or intentional; the _exemption_ is always intentional; we may be _free_ from disorders, or _free_ from troubles; we are _exempt_, that is, _exempted_ by government, from serving in the militia. _Free_ is applied to everything from which any one may wish to be _free;_ but _exempt_, on the contrary, to those burdens which we should share with others: we may be _free_ from imperfections, _free_ from inconveniences, _free_ from the interruptions of others, but _exempt_ from any office or tax. We may likewise be said to be _exempt_ from troubles when speaking of these as the dispensations of Providence to others.  
**FREEDOM, LIBERTY.** — _Freedom_, the abstract noun of _free_, is taken in all the senses of the primitive. _Liberty_, from the Latin _liber_, free, is only taken in the sense of _free_ from external constraint, from the action of power.  
_Freedom_ is personal and private; _liberty_ is public. _The freedom_ of the city is the privilege granted by the city to individuals; the _liberties_ of the city are the immunities enjoyed by the city. By the same rule of distinction we speak of the _freedom_ of the will, the _freedom_ of manners, the _freedom_ of conversation, or the _freedom_ of debate; but the _liberty_ of conscience, the _liberty_ of the press, the _liberty_ of the subject.  
_Freedom_ serves, moreover, to qualify the action; _liberty_ is applied only to the agent; hence we say, to speak or think with _freedom;_ but to have the _liberty_ of speaking, thinking, or acting.  
_Freedom_ and _liberty_ are likewise employed for the private conduct of individuals toward one another; but the former is used in a qualified good sense, the latter often in an unqualified bad sense. A _freedom_ may sometimes be licensed or allowed; a _liberty_, if it be taken, may be something not agreeable or allowed. A _freedom_ may be innocent and even pleasant; a _liberty_ may do more or less violence to the decencies of life or the feelings of individuals. There are little _freedoms_ which may pass between youth of different sexes, so as to heighten the pleasures of society; but a modest woman will be careful to guard against any _freedoms_ which may admit of misinterpretation, and resent every _liberty_ offered to her as an insult. 

####freight 
**FREIGHT, BURDEN, CARGO, LADING, LOAD.**  
_Freight_ is a word which has come from Dutch or Low German through French into English; it originally signified the earnings or the hire of a ship. _Cargo_ comes through Spanish from the Late Latin _carricare_, to load a car. _Lading_, from _lade_, is derived from Anglo-Saxon _hladan_, to heap, to heap together. _Load_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _lad_, a way or journey, allied to Modern English _lead_, and signifies that which is carried on a journey. _Burden_, from _bear_, conveys the idea of weight which is borne by the vessel.  
A captain speaks of the _freight_ of his ship as that which is the object of his voyage, by which all who are interested in it are to make their profit; he speaks of the _lading_ as the thing which is to fill the ship; the quantity and weight of the _lading_ are to be taken into the consideration: he speaks of the _cargo_ as that which goes with the ship, and belongs, as it were, to the ship; the amount of the _cargo_ is that which is first thought of: he speaks of the _burden_ as that which his vessel will bear; it is the property of the ship which is to be estimated. The ship-broker regulates the _freight:_ the captain and the crew dispose of the _lading:_ the agent sees to the procuring of the _cargo:_ the ship-builder determines the _burden:_ the carrier looks to the _load_ which he has to carry.

####frequent 
**FREQUENT, RESORT TO, HAUNT.**  
_Frequent_ comes from French _frequent_, in Latin _frequens_, crowded, signifying to come in numbers, or come often to the same place. _Resort_ comes from Late Latin _resortere_, from _re_, again, and sors, a lot, and meant to go to a tribunal, to re-obtain by appeal. _Haunt_, from Old French _hanter_, is a word whose ultimate origin and meaning are disputed.  
_Frequent_ is more commonly used of an individual who goes often to a place; _resort_ and _haunt_, of a number of individuals. A man is said to _frequent_ a public place; but several persons may _resort to_ a private place: men who are not fond of home _frequent_ taverns; in the first ages of Christianity, while persecution raged, its professors used to _resort to_ private places for purposes of worship.  
_Frequent_ and _resort_ are indifferent actions; but _haunt_ is always Used in a bad sense. A man may _frequent_ a theatre, a club, or any other social meeting, innocent or otherwise; people from different quarters may _resort to_ a fair, a church, or any other place where they wish to meet for a common purpose; but those who _haunt_ any place go to it in privacy for some bad purpose.

####frighten 
**FRIGHTEN, INTIMIDATE.**  
Between _frighten_ and _intimidate_ there is the same difference as between _fright_ (see [alarm](entry://alarm)) and _fear_ (see [apprehend](entry://apprehend)): the danger that is near or before the eyes _frightens;_ that which is seen at a distance _intimidates:_ hence females are oftener _frightened_ and men are oftener _intimidated:_ noises will _frighten;_ threats may _intimidate:_ we may run away when we _axe frightened;_ we waver in our resolution when we are _intimidated;_ we fear immediate bodily harm when we are _frightened;_ we fear harm to our property as well as our persons when we are _intimidated; frighten_, therefore, is always applied to animals, but _intimidate_ never.

####frolic 
**FROLIC, GAMBOL, PRANK.**  
_Frolic_ is a Dutch word, allied to German _froh_, merry. _Gambol_ is derived through French from Italian _gambata_, a kick, Italian _gamba_, a leg (French _jambe)_, from Late Latin _gamba_, a joint of the leg. _Prank_ comes from Middle English _pranken_, to trim; compare _prink_, to arrange one's clothes before a mirror. The _frolic_ is a merry, joyous entertainment; the _gambol_ is a dancing, light entertainment; the _prank_ is a freakish, wild entertainment. Laughing, singing, noise, and feasting constitute the _frolic_ of the careless mind; it belongs to a company; conceit, levity, and trick, in movement, gesture, and contrivance, constitute the _gambol;_ it belongs to the individual: adventure, eccentricity, and humor constitute the _prank;_ it belongs to one or many. One has a _frolic;_ one plays a _gambol_ or a _prank._

####fulfil 
**FULFIL, ACCOMPLISH, REALIZE.**  
To _fulfil_ is literally to fill quite full, that is, to bring about _full_ to the wishes of a person; _accomplish_ is to bring to perfection, but without reference to the wishes of any one; to _realize_ is to make _real_, namely, whatever has been aimed at. The application of these terms is evident from their explanations: the wishes, the expectations, the intentions and promises of an individual are appropriately said to be _fulfilled;_ national projects, or undertakings, prophecies, and whatever is of general interest are said to be _accomplished:_ the fortune or the prospects of an individual, or whatever results successfully from specific efforts, is said to be _realized:_ the _filfilment_ of our wishes may be as much the effect of good fortune as of design; the _accomplishment_ of projects mostly results from extraordinary exertion, as the _accomplishment_ of prophecies results from a miraculous exertion of power; the _realization_ of hopes results more commonly from the slow process of moderate well-combined efforts than from anything extraordinary.

####fulness 
**FULNESS, PLENITUDE.**  
Although _fulness_ is simply the Anglo-Saxon translation of Latin _plenitude_ (from _plenus_, full), yet the latter is used either in the proper sense to express the state of objects that _axe full_, or in the improper sense to express great quantity, which is the accompaniment of _fulness;_ the former only in the higher style and in the improper sense: hence we say in the _fulness_ of one's heart, in the _fulness_ of one's joy, or the _fulness_ of the Godhead bodily; but the _plenitude_ of power. 

####fulsome 
**FULSOME, FLORID, RANK.**  
All these words indicate an overgrowth, over-development, especially as applied figuratively to language or manners. _Fulsome_ originally meant over _full_, indicating a _fulness_ of growth — animal or vegetable growth — offensive to the taste. It is now almost obsolete except as applied figuratively to speech, to refer to exaggerated flattery or over-demonstrative affection. _Florid_, from _florem_ (accusative), flower, means literally flowery, and is applied figuratively to speech, but it has different connotations; it refers simply to the elaborate and ornamental phraseology without the suggestion of flattery or demonstrativeness. _Rank_, Anglo-Saxon _rank_, strong, proud, like _fulsome_, applies to coarse, luxuriant growth, and by extension to a kind of speech — as when we say "rank flattery" — with an emphasis upon offensiveness.

####funeral 
**FUNERAL, OBSEQUIES.**  
_Funeral_ is in Latin _funus_, a burial; the term _funeral_, therefore, denotes the ordinary solemnity which attends the consignment of a body to the grave. _Obsequies_, from Latin _ob_, near, and _sequi_, to follow, means literally following the corpse, and refers to _funerals_ attended with more than ordinary solemnity.  
We speak of the _funeral_ as the last sad office which we perform for a friend; it is accompanied by nothing but by mourning and sorrow: we speak of _obsequies_ as the greatest tribute of respect which can be paid to the person of one who was high in station or public esteem: the _funeral_, by its frequency, becomes so familiar an object that it passes by unheeded; _obsequies_ which are performed over the remains of the great attract our notice from the pomp and grandeur with which they are conducted.

####gain 
**GAIN, PROFIT, EMOLUMENT, LUCRE.**  
_Gain_ signifies in general what is gained (see [acquire](entry://acquire); [get](entry://get)). _Profit_ (see [advantage](entry://advantage)). _Emolument_, from _emoliri_, from _e_, out, and _moliri_, to work, signifies to work out or get by working. _Lucre_ is in Latin _lucrum_, gain.  
_Gain_ is here a general term, the other terms are specific: the _gain_ is that which comes to a man; it is the fruit of his exertions, or agreeable to his wish: the _profit_ is that which accrues from the thing. Thus, when applied to riches, that which increases a man's estate is his _gains;_ that which flows out of his trade or occupation is his _profits;_ that is, they are his _gains_ upon dealing. _Emolument_ is a species of _gain_ from labor, or a collateral _gain;_ of this description are a man's _emoluments_ from an office: a man estimates his _gains_ by what he receives in the year; he estimates his _profits_ by what he receives on every article; he estimates his _emoluments_ according to the nature of the service which he has to perform: the merchant talks of his _gains_, the retail dealer of his _profits_, the placeman of his _emoluments. Gain_ and _profit_ are also taken in an abstract sense; _lucre_ is never used otherwise; but the latter always conveys a bad meaning; it is, strictly speaking, unhallowed _gain:_ an immoderate thirst for _gain_ is the vice of men who are always calculating _profit_ and loss; a thirst for _lucre_ deadens every generous feeling of the mind.  
_Gain_ and _profit_ may be extended to other objects, and sometimes opposed to each other; for as that which we _gain_ is what we wish only, it is often the reverse of _profitable._

####gallant 
**GALLANT, BEAU, SPARK.**  
These words convey nothing respectful of the person to whom they are applied; but the first, as is evident from its derivation, has something in it to recommend it to attention above the others: as true valor is ever associated with a regard for the fair sex, a _gallant_ man will always be a _gallant_ when he can render a female any service; sometimes, however, his _gallantries_ may be such as to do them harm rather than good: insignificance and effeminacy characterize the _beau_ or fine gentleman; he is the woman's man — the humble servant to supply the place of a lackey: the _spark_ has but a _spark_ of that fire which shows itself in impertinent puerilities; it is applicable to youth who are just broke loose from school or college and eager to display their manhood.

####gape 
**GAPE, STARE, GAZE.**  
_Gape_ is a Scandinavian word meaning to look with an open or wide mouth. _Stare_, Anglo-Saxon _starian_, is allied to _sta_, the root of _stand, station, statue_, etc.; and signifies to look with fixed eyes. _Gaze_, Middle English _gasen_, is a Scandinavian word meaning to look at earnestly.  
_Gape_ and _stare_ are taken in a bad sense, the former indicating the astonishment of gross ignorance, the latter not only ignorance, but impertinence: _gaze_ is taken always in a good sense, as indicating a laudable feeling of astonishment, pleasure, or curiosity: a clown _gapes_ at the pictures of wild beasts which he sees at a fair; an impertinent fellow _stares_ at every woman he looks at, and _stares_ a modest woman out of countenance: a lover of the fine arts will _gaze_ with admiration and de-light at the productions of Raphael or Titian; when a person is stupefied by affright he gives a vacant _stare:_ those who are filled with transport _gaze_ on the object of their ecstasy. 

####garner 
**GARNER, DEPOSIT, HOARD**  
_Garner_ comes from Latin _granaria_, a place in which the _grain (granum)_ is gathered. _Deposit_ is derived from _depositus_, the past participle of Latin _deponere_, to lay down. _Hoard_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _hord_, from a root signifying to _hide._ These words have in common the general idea of gathering and stowing away, but they differ widely in their application. In one sense _garner_ is synonymous with _gather_, which see. It signified originally to gather and put away the grain, and is used figuratively always with a distinct and poetic reminiscence of its original meaning. _Deposit_ emphasizes not the gathering, but the putting away; it is given a special application nowadays in business. A _deposit_ of money is a sum of money paid down against a debt that may be incurred, or simply the putting away of money in a bank. _Hoard_ adds to the idea of gathering and stowing away the special suggestion of _hiding secretly._ A miser _hoards_ his money; selfish people, in time of war, _hoard_ foodstuffs, etc. 

####garnish 
**GARNISH, TRIM.**  
_Garnish_, Old French _garnis_, comes from Old High German _warnon_, to defend one's self, to provide one's self with. It shares with _trim_ the general idea of adorning by the addition of something external, especially of small and pretty decorations; but it has now a somewhat more limited application than _trim._ We speak of _garnishing_ when we wish to refer especially to an ephemeral and perishable _trimming._ We _garnish_ dishes served at the table, for instance; we may speak of _garnishing_ a room with flowers. _Trim_ is used in this connection, but it is extended to refer to all sorts of ornamental additions, including those of a more permanent nature — as _trimming_ a hat, a dress, etc. It is a less dignified word than _adorn_ and its synonymes (see [adorn](entry://adorn)), with which it has something in common.

**GATHER, COLLECT.**  
To _gather_ is in Anglo-Saxon _gaderian_, to bring things together, from the root also found in _together._ To _collect_ (see [assemble](entry://assemble)) annexes also the idea of binding or forming into a whole; we _gather_ that which is scattered in different parts: thus stones are _gathered_ into a heap; vessels are _collected_ so as to form a fleet. _Gathering_ is a mere act of necessity or convenience; _collecting_ is an act of design or choice: we _gather_ apples from a tree, or a servant _gathers_ books from off a table; the antiquarian _collects_ coins, and the bibliomaniac _collects_ rare books.

####gender 
**GENDER, SEX.**  
_Gender_, in Latin _genus_, signifies properly a _genus_, or kind. Sex comes from Latin _sexus._ "Was it originally 'division, ' from _secare_, to cut? " (Skeat.) _Gender_ is that distinction in words which marks the distinction of _sex_ in things; there are, therefore, three _genders_, but only two _sexes._ By the inflections of words is denoted whether things are of this or that _sex_ or of no _sex._ The _genders_, therefore, are divided in grammar into _masculine, feminine_, and _neuter;_ and animals are divided into male and female _sex._

####general 
**GENERAL, UNIVERSAL.**  
The _general_ is to the _universal_ what the part is to the whole. What is _general_ includes the greater part or number; what is _universal_ includes every individual or part. The _general_ rule admits of many exceptions; the _universal_ rule admits of none. Human government has the _general_ good for its object; the government of Providence is directed to _universal_ good. _General_ is opposed to particular, and _universal_ to individual. A scientific writer will not content himself with _general_ remarks when he has it in his power to enter into particulars; the _universal_ complaint which we hear against men for their pride shows that in every individual it exists to a greater or less degree. It is a _general_ opinion that women are not qualified for scientific pursuits, but many females have proved themselves honorable exceptions to this rule: it is à _universal_ principle that children ought to honor their parents; the intention of the Creator in this respect is manifested in such a variety of forms as to admit of no question.

**GENERATION, AGE.**

Those who are born at the same time constitute the _generation;_ that period of time which comprehends the age of man is the _age:_ there may, therefore, be many _generations_ spring up in the course of an _age;_ a fresh _generation_ is springing up every day, which in the course of an _age_ pass away and are succeeded by fresh _generations._ We consider man in his _generation_ as to the part which he has to perform. We consider the _age_ in which we live as to the manners of men and the events of nations.

####genteel 
**GENTEEL, POLITE.**  
_Genteel_, in French _gentil_, Latin _gentilis_, signifies literally one belonging to the same family, or the next akin to whom the estate would fall if there were no children; hence by an extended application it denoted to be of a good family. _Polite_ (see [civil](entry://civil)).  
_Gentility_ respects rank in life; _politeness_, the refinement of the mind and outward behavior. A _genteel_ education is suited to the station of a gentleman; a _polite_ education fits for polished society and conversation, and raises the individual among his equals. There may be _gentility_ without _politeness_, and _vice versa._ A person may have _genteel_ manners, a _genteel_ carriage, a _genteel_ mode of living as far as respects his general relation with society; but a _polite_ behavior and a _polite_ address, which may qualify him for every relation in society and enable him to shine in connection with all orders of men, is independent of either birth or wealth; it is in part a gift of nature, although it is to be acquired by art. His equipage, servants, house, and furniture may be such as to entitle a man to the name of _genteel_, although he is wanting in all the forms of real good-breeding; while fortune may sometimes frown upon the polished gentleman, whose _politeness_ is a recommendation to him wherever he goes. 

####gentile 
**GENTILE, HEATHEN, PAGAN.**  
The Jews comprehended all strangers under the name of Goim, nations or _gentiles:_ among the Greeks and Romans they were designated by the name of barbarians. By the name _gentile_ was understood especially those who were not of the Jewish religion, including, in the end, even the Christians. Some learned men pretend that the _Gentiles_ were so named from their having only a natural law, and such as they imposed on themselves, in opposition to the Jews and Christians, who have a positive revealed law to which they are obliged to submit. _Heathen_, Anglo-Saxon _hœthen_, meant originally a dweller on the heath; _pagan_ comes from Latin _pagus_, village, and means a dweller in the village, because when Constantine banished idolaters from the towns they repaired to the villages, and secretly adhered to their religious worship, whence they were termed by the Christians of the fourth century _Pagani_, which was translated literally into the German _heidener_, a villager or worshipper in the field. Be this as it may, it is evident that the word _pagan_ is in our language more applicable than _heathen_ to the Greeks, the Romans, and the cultivated nations who practiced idolatry; and, on the other hand, _heathen_ is more properly employed for rude and uncivilized people who worship false gods.  
The _Gentile_ does not expressly believe in a Divine Revelation; but he either admits of the truth in part or is ready to receive it: the _heathen_ adopts a positively false system that is opposed to the true faith: the _pagan_ is a species of _heathen_, who obstinately persists in a worship which is merely the fruit of his own imagination. The _heathens_ and _pagans_ are _Gentiles;_ but the _Gentiles_ are not all either _heathens_ or _pagans._ Confucius and Socrates, who rejected the plurality of gods, and the followers of Mohammed, who adore the true God, are, properly speaking, _Gentiles._ The worshippers of Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, and all the deities of the ancients are termed _pagans._ The worshippers of Fo, Brahma, Xaca, and all the deities of savage nations are termed _heathens._ The _Gentiles_ were called to the true faith, and obeyed the call: many of the illustrious _pagans_ would have doubtless done the same had they enjoyed the same privilege: there are to this day many _heathens_ who reject this advantage, to pursue their own blind imaginations. 

####gentle 
**GENTLE, TAME.**  
_Gentleness_ lies rather in the natural disposition; _tameness_ is the effect either of art or circumstances. Any unbroken horse maybe _gentle_, but not _tame;_ a horse that is broken in will be _tame_, but not always _gentle. Gentle_, as before observed (see [genteel](entry://genteel)), signifies literally well-born, and is opposed either to the fierce or the rude: _tame_ is allied to Latin _do-mare_, to tame, whence _daunt_ is also derived, and is opposed either to the wild or the spirited. Animals are in general said to be _gentle_ who show a disposition to associate with man and conform to his will; they are said to be _tame_ if, either by compulsion or habit, they are brought to mix with human society. Of the first description there are individuals in almost every species which are more or less entitled to the name of _gentle;_ of the latter description are many species, as the dog, the sheep, the hen, and the like.  
In the moral application, _gentle_ is always employed in the good, and _tame_ in the bad, sense: a _gentle_ spirit needs no control, it amalgamates freely with the will of another: a _tame_ spirit is without any will of its own; it is alive to nothing but submission; it is perfectly consistent with our natural liberty to have _gentleness_, but _tameness_ is the accompaniment of slavery. The same distinction marks the use of these words when applied to the outward conduct or the language: _gentle_ bespeaks something positively good; _tame_ bespeaks the want of an essential good: the former is allied to the kind, the latter to the abject and mean qualities which naturally flow from the compression or destruction of energy and will in the agent. A _gentle_ expression is devoid of all acrimony and serves to turn away wrath: a _tame_ expression is devoid of all force or energy, and ill calculated to inspire the mind with any feeling whatever. In giving counsel to an irritable and conceited temper it is necessary to be _gentle: tame_ expressions are nowhere such striking deformities as in a poem or an oration.

####germ 
**GERM, BUD, EMBRYO, SEED.**  
These words all indicate the original or rudimentary state of a living organism — either animal or plant. _Germ_ and _seed_ represent the first beginnings, as it were, of life; _embryo_ and _bud_, an early stage of development. _Germ_ is a word of doubtful origin, probably allied to the root _ger_ in _gerere_, to bear; it signifies that portion of an organic being which is capable of developing into the likeness of that from which it sprang. _Seed_, from Anglo-Saxon _sawan_, to sow, indicates that portion of a plant which is sown in the ground, and from which the new plant springs; it is the _germ_ of the plant with a protective covering. _Embryo_, Greek _έμβρυον_, Greek _έν_ and _βρύον_, neuter of the present participle of _βρύειν_, to be full, to swell out. It refers to the first stage of new animal life. _Bud_, Middle English _budde_, is not found in Anglo-Saxon. It refers to the first stage of a new flower or the group of new leaves folded together in a hard little bundle, as it were.

####get 
**GET, GAIN, OBTAIN, PROCURE.**  
To _get_ signifies simply to cause to have or possess; it is generic, and the rest specific: to _gain_ is to _get_ the thing one wishes or that is for one's advantage: to _obtain_ is to _get_ the thing aimed at or striven after: to _procure_, from _pro_, for, and _curare_, to care, to care for, is to _get_ the thing wanted or sought for.  
_Get_ is not only the most general in its sense, but in its application; it may be substituted in almost every case for the other terms, for we may say to _get_ or _gain_ a prize, to _get_ or _obtain_ a reward, to _get_ or _procure_ a book; and it is also employed in numberless familiar cases, where the other terms would be less suitable, for, what this word gains in familiarity it loses in dignity: hence we may with propriety talk of a servant's _getting_ some water, or a person _getting_ a book off a shelf or _getting_ meat from the butcher, with numberless similar cases in which the other terms could not be employed without losing their dignity. Moreover, _get_ is promiscuously used for whatever comes to the hand, whether good or bad, desirable or not desirable, sought for or not; but _gain, obtain_, and _procure_ always include either the wishes or the instrumentality of the agent, or both together. Thus a person is said to _get_ a cold or a fever, a good or an ill name, without specifying any of the circumstances of the action; but he is said to _gain_ that approbation which is gratifying to his feelings; to _obtain_ a recompense which is the object of his exertions; to _procure_ a situation which is the end of his endeavors.  
The word _gain_ is peculiarly applicable to whatever comes to us fortuitously; what we _gain_ constitutes our good fortune; we _gain_ a victory or we _gain_ a cause; the result in both cases may be independent of our exertions. To _obtain_ and _procure_ exclude the idea of chance, and suppose exertions directed to a specific end: but the former may include the exertions of others, the latter is particularly employed for one's own personal exertions. A person _obtains_ a situation through the recommendation of a friend: he _procures_ a situation by applying for it. _Obtain_ is likewise employed only in that which requires particular efforts, that which is not immediately within our reach; _procure_ is applicable to that which is to be _got_ with ease, by the simple exertion of a walk, or of asking for.

####gift 
**GIFT, PRESENT, DONATION.**  
_Gift_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _gifan_, to give (the hard _g_ sound being due to Scandinavian influence), in the sense of what is communicated to another gratuitously of one's property. _Present_ is derived from to _present_, signifying the thing _presented_ to another. _Donation_, in French _donation_, from the Latin _donare_, to _present_ or _give_, is a species of _gift._  
The _gift_ is an act of generosity or condescension; it contributes to the benefit of the receiver: the _present_ is an act of kindness, courtesy, or respect; it contributes to the pleasure of the receiver. The _gift_ passes from the rich to the poor, from the high to the low, and creates an obligation; the _present_ passes either between equals or from the inferior to the superior. Whatever we receive from God, through the bounty of His providence, we entitle a _gift;_ whatever we receive from our friends, or whatever princes receive from their subjects, are entitled _presents._ We are told by all travellers that, it is a custom in the East never to approach a great man without a _present_, the value of a _gift_ is often heightened by being given opportunely. The value of a _present_ often depends upon the esteem we have for the giver; the smallest _present_ from an esteemed friend is of more worth in our eyes than the costliest _presents_ that monarchs receive.  
The _gift_ is private, and benefits the individual: the _donation_ is public, and serves some general purpose: what is given to relieve the necessities of any poor person is a _gift;_ what is given to support an institution is a _donation._ The clergy are indebted to their patrons for the livings which are in their _gift:_ it has been the custom of the pious and charitable in all ages to make _donations_ for the support of almshouses, hospitals, infirmaries, and such institutions as serve to diminish the sum of human misery.  
**GIFT, ENDOWMENT, TALENT.** — _Gift_ (see above). _Endowment_ signifies the thing with which one is endowed. _Talent_ (see [ability](entry://ability)).  
_Gift_ and _endowment_ both refer to the act of _giving_ and _endowing_, and of course include the idea of something given and something received: the word _talent_ conveys no such collateral idea. When we speak of a _gift_, we refer in our minds to a _giver;_ when we speak of an _endowment_, we refer in our minds to the receiver; when we speak of a _talent_, we only think of its intrinsic quality. A _gift_ is either supernatural or natural; an _endowment_ is only natural. The primitive Christians received various _gifts_ through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, as the, _gift_ of tongues, the _gift_ of healing, etc. There are some men who have a peculiar _gift_ of utterance; beauty of person and corporeal agility are _endowments_ with which some are peculiarly invested.  
The word _gift_ excludes the idea of anything acquired by exertion; it is that which is communicated to us altogether independently of ourselves, and enables us to arrive at that perfection in any art which could not be attained any other way. Speech is denominated a general _gift_, inasmuch as it is given to the whole human race in distinction from the brutes; but the _gift_ of eloquence is a peculiar _gift_ granted to a few individuals, in distinction from others, and one which may be exerted for the benefit of mankind. _Endowments_, though inherent in us, are not independent of our exertions; they are qualities which admit of improvement by being used; they are, in fact, the _gifts_ of nature, which serve to adorn and elevate the possessor when employed for a good purpose. _Talents_ are either natural or acquired, or in some measure of a mixed nature; they denote powers without specifying the source from which they proceed; a man may have a _talent_ for music, for drawing, for mimicry, and the like; but this _talent_ may be the fruit of practice and experience as much as of nature. It is clear from the above that an _endowment_ is a _gift_, but a _gift_ is not always an _endowment;_ and that a _talent_ may also be either a _gift_ or an _endowment_, but that it is frequently distinct from both. The terms _gift_ and _talent_ are applicable to corporeal as well as spiritual actions; _endowment_ to corporeal or mental qualities. To write a superior hand is a _gift_, inasmuch as it is supposed to be unattainable by any force of application and instruction; it is a _talent_, inasmuch as it is a power or property worth our possession, but it is never an _endowment._ On the other hand, courage, discernment, a strong imagination, and the like are both _gifts_ and _endowments;_ and when the intellectual _endowment_ displays itself in any creative form, as in the case of poetry, music, or any art, so as to produce that which is valued and esteemed, it becomes a _talent_ to the possessor.

####give 
**GIVE, GRANT, BESTOW.**  
For the derivation of _give_ see [gift](entry://gift); _grant_ and _bestow_ (see [allow](entry://allow)).  
The idea of communicating to another what is our own or in our power is common to these terms; this is the whole signification of _give;_ but _grant_ and _bestow_ include accessory ideas in their meaning. To _grant_ is to _give_ at one's pleasure; to _bestow_ is to give from a certain degree of necessity. _Giving_ is confined to no object; whatever property we transfer into the hands of another, that we _give;_ we _give_ money, clothes, food, or whatever is transferable: _granting_ is confined to such objects as afford pleasure or convenience; they may consist of transferable property or not; _bestowing_ is applied to such objects only as are necessary to supply wants, which always consist of that which is transferable. We _give_ what is liked or not liked, asked for or unasked for: we _grant_ that only which is wished for and requested. One may _give_ poison or medicine; one _grants_ a sum of money by way of loan: we _give_ what is wanted or not wanted; we _bestow_ that only which is expressly wanted: we _give_ with an idea of a return or otherwise: we _grant_ voluntarily, without any prospect of a return: we give for a permanency or otherwise; we _bestow_ only in particular cases which require immediate notice.  
To _give_ has no respect to the circumstances of the action or the agent; it is applicable to persons of all conditions: to _grant_ bespeaks not only the will, but the power and influence of the _grantor:_ to _bestow_ bespeaks the necessitous condition of the receiver. Children may _give_ to their parents and parents to their children, kings to their subjects or subjects to their kings; but monarchs only _grant_ to their subjects, or parents to their children; and superiors in general _bestow_ upon their dependents that which they cannot provide for themselves.  
In an extended application of the terms to moral objects or circumstances they strictly adhere to the same line of distinction. We _give_ our consent; we _give_ our promise; we _give_ our word; we _give_ credit; we _give_ in all cases that which may be simply transferred from one to another. Liberties, rights, privileges, favors, indulgences, permissions, and all things are _granted_ which are in the hands of only a few but are acceptable to many. Blessings, care, concern, and the like, are _bestowed_ upon those who are dependent upon others for whatever they have.  
_Give_ and _bestow_ are likewise said of things as well as of persons; _grant_ is said only of persons. _Give_ is here equally general and indefinite; _bestow_ conveys the idea of _giving_ under circumstances of necessity and urgency. One _gives_ a preference to a particular situation; one _gives_ a thought to a subject that is proposed; one _gives_ time and labor to any matter that engages one's attention: but one _bestows_ pains on that which demands particular attention; one _bestows_ a moment's thought on one particular subject out of the number which engage attention.  
**GIVE, AFFORD.** — _Give_ and _afford_ are allied to each other in the sense of sending forth; but the former denotes an unqualified and unconditional action, as in the preceding article; the latter bears a relation to the circumstances of the agent. A person is said to _give_ money without any regard to the state of his finances: he is said to _afford_ what he _gives_, when one wishes to define his pecuniary condition. The same idea runs through the application of these terms to all other cases, in which inanimate things are made the agents. When we say a thing _gives_ satisfaction, we simply designate the action; when we say it _affords_ pleasure, we refer to the nature and properties of the thing thus, specified — that is to say, its capacity to give satisfaction; the former is employed only to declare the fact, the latter to characterize the object. Hence, in certain cases, we should say this or that posture of the body _gives_ ease to a sick person; but, as a moral sentiment, we should say nothing _affords_ such ease to the mind as a clear conscience. Upon the same grounds the use of. these terms is justified in the following cases: to _give_ rise; to _give_ birth; to _give_ occasion; to _afford_ an opportunity; to _afford_ a plea or a pretext; to _afford_ ground, and the like.  
**GIVE, PRESENT, OFFER, EXHIBIT.** — These terms have a common signification, inasmuch as they designate the manual act of transferring something from one's self to another. The first is, here as elsewhere, the most indefinite and extensive in its meaning; it denotes the complete act: the latter two refer rather to the preliminaries of _giving_ than to the act itself. What is _given_ is actually transferred: what is _presented_, that is, made a _present_ to any one, or _offered_, that is, brought in his way, is put in the way of being transferred: we _present_ in _giving_, and _offer_ in order to _give;_ but we may _give_ without presenting or offering; and, on the other hand, we may _present_ or _offer_ without _giving_, if the thing _presented_ or _offered_ be not received.  
To _give_ is the familiar term which designates the ordinary transfer of property: to _present_ is a term of respect; it includes in it the formality and ceremony of setting before another that which we wish to _give:_ to _offer_ is an act of humility or solemnity; it bespeaks the movement of the heart, which impels to the making a transfer or _gift._ We _give_ to our domestics; we _present_ to princes; we _offer_ to God: we _give_ to a person what we wish to be received; we _present_ to a person what we think agreeable; we _offer_ what we think acceptable; what is _given_ is supposed to be ours; what we _offer_ is supposed to be at our command; what we _present_ need not be either our own or at our command: we _give_ a person not only our external property, but our esteem, our confidence, our company, and the like: an ambassador _presents_ his credentials at court; a subject _offers_ his services to his king.  
They bear the same relation to each other when applied to words or actions, instead of property: we speak of _giving_ a person an assurance or a contradiction; of _presenting_ an address and _offering_ an apology: of _giving_ a reception, _presenting_ a figure, or _offering_ an insult. They may likewise be extended in their application, not only to personal and individual actions, but also to such as respect the public at large: we _give_ a description in writing, as well as by word of mouth; one _presenis_ the public with the fruit of one's labors; we _offer_ remarks on such things as attract notice and call for animadversion.  
These terms may also be employed to designate the actions of unconscious agents, by which they are characterized: in this sense they come very near to the word _exhibit_, which, from _exhibeo_, signifies to hold or put forth. Here the word _give_ is equally indefinite and general, denoting simply to send from one's self, and applies mostly to what proceeds from another, by a natural cause: thus, a thing is said to _give_ pain or to _give_ pleasure. Things are said to _present or offer:_ thus, a town is said to _present_ a fine view, or an idea _presents_ itself to the mind; an opportunity _offers_, that is, _offers_ itself to our notice. To _exhibit_ is properly applied in this sense of setting forth to view; but expresses, likewise, the idea of attracting notice also: that which is _exhibited_ is more striking than what is _presented_ or _offered_, thus a poem is said to _exhibit_ marks of genius.  
**GIVE UP, DELIVER, SURRENDER, YIELD, CEDE, CONCEDE.** — We _give up_ that which we wish to retain; we _deliver_ that which we wish not to retain. _Deliver_ does not include the idea of a transfer; but _give up_ implies both the _giving_ from and the _giving_ to: we _give up_ our house to the accommodation of our friends; we _deliver_ property into the hands of the owner. To _give up_ is a colloquial substitute for either _surrender_ or _yield_, as it designates no circumstance of the action; it may be employed in familiar discourse, in almost every ease, for the other terms: where the action is compulsory we may either say an officer _gives up_ or _surrenders_ his sword; when the action is discretionary, we may either say he _gives up_ or _yields_ a point of discussion: _give up_ has, however, an extensiveness of application which gives it an office distinct from either _surrender_ or _yield._ When we speak of familiar and personal subjects, _give up_ is more suitable than _surrender_, which is confined to matters of public interest or great moment: a man _gives up_ his place, his right, his claim, and the like; he _surrenders_ a fortress, a vessel, or his property to his creditors. When _give up_ is compared with _yield_, they both respect personal matters; but the former expresses a much stronger action than the latter: a man _gives up_ his whole judgment to another; he _yields_ to the opinion of another in particular cases: he _gives_ himself _up_ to sensual indulgences; he _yields_ to the force of temptation.  
_Cede_, from the Latin _cedere_, to come to, to yield, to give, is properly to _surrender_ by virtue of a treaty: we may _surrender_ a town as an act of necessity; but the _cession_ of a country is purely a political transaction: thus, generals frequently _surrender_ such towns as they are not able to defend; and governments _cede_ such countries as they find it not convenient to retain. To _concede_, which is but a variation of _cede_, is a mode of _yielding_ which may be either an act of discretion or courtesy; as when a government _concedes to_ the demands of the people certain privileges, or when an individual _concedes_ any point in dispute for the sake of peace.  
**GIVE UP, ABANDON, RESIGN, FOREGO.** — These terms differ from the preceding ones, inasmuch as they designate actions entirely free from foreign influence. A man _gives up, abandons_, and _resigns_ from the dictates of his own mind, independently of all control from others. To _give up_ and _abandon_ both denote a positive decision of the mind; but the former may be the act of the understanding or the will; the latter is more commonly the act of the will and the passions: to _give up_ is applied to familiar cases; _abandon_ to matters of importance: one _gives up_ an idea, an intention, a plan, and the like; one _abandons_ a project, a scheme, a measure of government.  
To _give up_ and _resign_ are applied either to outward actions or merely to inward movements; but the former is active and determinately fixes the conduct; the latter seems to be rather passive — it is the leaning of the mind to the circumstances: a man _gives up_ his situation by a positive act of his choice; he _resigns_ his office when he feels it inconvenient to hold it; so, likewise, we _give up_ expectations and _resign_ hopes. In this sense, _forego_, which signifies to let go, is comparable with _resign_, inasmuch as it expresses a passive action; but we _resign_ that which we have, and we _forego_ that which we might have: thus, we _resign_ the claims which we have already made; we _forego_ the claims which we might make: the former may be a matter of prudence; the latter is always an act of virtue and forbearance.  
When applied to the state of a person's mind, or the actions flowing from that state, to _give up_ is used either in a good, bad, or indifferent sense; _abandon_ always in a bad sense; _resign_ always in a good sense: a man may _give_ himself _up_ either to studious pursuits, to idle vagaries, or vicious indulgences; he _abandons_ himself to gross" vices; he _resigns_ himself to the will of Providence, or to the circumstances of his condition: a man is said to be _given up_ to his lusts who is without any principle to control him in their gratification; he is said to be _abandoned_ when his outrageous conduct bespeaks an entire insensibility to every honest principle; he is said to be _resigned_ when he discovers composure and tranquillity in the hour of affliction; so one is said to _resign_ a thing to another when one is contented with what one has. 

####glad 
**GLAD, PLEASED, JOYFUL, CHEERFUL.**  
_Glad_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _glœd_, smooth, bright, allied to German _glatt_, smooth, polished. _Pleased_, from to _please_, marks the state of being _pleased. Joyful_ bespeaks its own meaning either as full of _joy_ or productive of great _joy_, from Latin _gaudium_, joy. _Cheerful_ (see **cheerful** under [cheer](entry://cheer)).  
_Glad_ denotes either a partial state or a permanent and habitual sentiment: in the former sense it is most nearly allied to _pleased;_ in the latter sense, to _joyful_ and merry. _Glad_ and _pleased_ are both applied to the ordinary occurrences of the day; but the former denotes rather a lively and momentary sentiment, the latter a gentle but rather more lasting feeling: we are _glad_ to see a friend who has been long absent; we are _glad_ to have good intelligence from our friends and relatives; we are _glad_ to get rid of a troublesome companion; we are _pleased_ to have the approbation of those we esteem: we are _pleased_ to hear our friends well spoken of; we are _pleased_ with the company of an intelligent and communicative person.  
_Glad, joyful_, and _cheerful_ all express more or less lively sentiments; bur. _glad_ is less vivid than _joyful_, and more so than _cheerful. Gladness_ seems to arise as much from physical as mental causes; wine is said to make the heart _glad: joy_ has its source in the mind, as it is influenced by external circumstances; instances of good fortune, for either ourselves, our friends, or our country, excite _joy: cheerfulness_ is an even tenor of the mind, which it may preserve of itself independently of all external circumstances; religious contemplation produces habitual _cheerfulness. Glad_ is seldom employed as an epithet to qualify things, except in the scriptural or solemn style, as _glad_ tidings of great _joy: joyful_ is seldomer used to qualify persons than things; hence we speak of _joyful_ news, a _joyful_ occurrence, _joyful_ faces, _joyful_ sounds, and the like: _cheerful_ is employed either to designate the state of the mind or the property of the thing; we either speak of a _cheerful_ disposition, a _cheerful_ person, a _cheerful_ society, or a _cheerful_ face, a _cheerful_ sound, a _cheerful_ aspect, and the like.  
When used to qualify one's actions they all bespeak the temper of the mind; _gladly_ denotes a high degree of willingness as opposed to aversion: one who is suffering under excruciating pains _gladly_ submits to anything which promises relief: _joyfully_ denotes unqualified _pleasure_, unmixed with any alloy or restrictive consideration; a convert to Christianity _joyfully_ goes through all the initiatory ceremonies which entitle him to all its privileges, spiritual and temporal; _cheerful_ denotes the absence of unwillingness, it is opposed to reluctantly; the zealous Christian _cheerfully_ submits to every hardship to which he is exposed in the course of his religious profession.

####glance at 
**GLANCE AT, ALLUDE TO.**  
_Glance_ is a nasalized form of Old French _glacier_, to slip, slide; it indicated a sliding beam of light. _Allude_ (see [allude](entry://allude)).  
These terms are nearly allied in the sense of indirectly referring to any object, either in written or verbal discourse: but _glance_ expresses a cursory and latent action; _allude_, simply an indirect but undisguised action: ill-natured satirists are perpetually _glancing_ at the follies and infirmities of individuals; the Scriptures are full of _allusions_ to the manners and customs of the Easterns: he who attempts to write an epitome of universal history must take but a hasty _glance_ at the most, important events.

####glare 
See [flame](entry://flame); [shine](entry://shine)

####glaring 
**GLARING, BAREFACED.**  
_Glaring_ is here used in the figurative sense, drawn from its natural signification of broad light, which strikes powerfully upon the senses. _Barefaced_ signifies literally having a _bare_ or _uncovered face_, which denotes the absence of all disguise or all shame.  
_Glaring_ designates the thing; _barefaced_ characterizes the person: a _glaring_ falsehood is that which strikes the observer in an instant to be falsehood; a _barefaced_ he or falsehood betrays the effrontery of him who utters it. A _glaring_ absurdity will be seen instantly without the aid of reflection; a _barefaced_ piece of impudence characterizes the agent as more than ordinarily lost to all sense of decorum. 

####gleam 
**GLEAM, GLIMMER, RAY, BEAM.**  
_Gleam_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _glœm_, from a root signifying brightness, whence _glimmer_, a frequentative, is also derived. _Ray_ comes from Latin _radius_, a ray — a beam of light issuing from a centre of light. _Beam_, Anglo-Saxon _beam_, from Teutonic root cognate with Greek _φαυσις_, a light, which appears in _phosphorus._  
Certain portions of light are designated by all these terms, but _gleam_ and _glimmer_ are indefinite; _ray_ and _beam_ are definite. A _gleam_ is properly the commencement of light, or that portion of opening light which interrupts the darkness: a _glimmer_ is an unsteady _gleam: ray_ and _beam_ are portions of light which emanate from some luminous body; the former from all luminous bodies in general, the latter more particularly from the sun: the former is, as its derivation denotes, a row of light issuing in a greater or less degree from any body; the latter is a great row of light, like a pole issuing from a body. There may be a _gleam_ of light visible on the wall of a dark room, or _glimmer_ if it be movable; there may be _rays_ of light visible at night on the back of a glow-worm, or _rays_ of light may break through the shutters of a closed room; the sun in the height of its splendor sends forth its _beams._

####gleaming 
See [lambent](entry://lambent)

####glee 
**GLEE, GAYETY, JOVIALITY, MERRIMENT, MIRTH.**  
_Glee_, Anglo-Saxon _gleo_, joy, mirth, and music, signifies in ordinary language an expression of joy, gladness, happiness, gratification over some pleasing occurrence. _Gayety_ implies the state of being exuberant or having a superabundance of good-humor, liveliness, cheerfulness, blitheness; _joviality_, the state of being jolly, convivial, festive, joyous; _merriment_, the state of being full of fun and good-humor, sportive, frolicsome, loudly cheerful, gay of heart; and _mirth_, the state of being playful, festive, vivacious, witty, facetious, fond of merrymaking, and the like.  
In another application the term _glee_ implies a musical composition sung in parts as a series of interwoven melodies for three or more voices, each part being limited to one voice; may be composed in any style and rendered with or without instrumentation.

####glimpse 
**GLIMPSE, GLANCE.**  
A _glimpse_ is the action of the object appearing to the eye; a _glance_ is the action of the eye seeking the object: one catches a _glimpse_ of an object; one casts a _glance_ at an object: the latter, therefore, is properly the means for obtaining the former, which is the end: we get a _glimpse by_ means of a _glance._ The _glimpse_ is the hasty, imperfect, and sudden view which we get of an object; the _glance_ is the hasty and imperfect view which we take of an object: the former may depend upon a variety of circumstances; the latter depends upon the will of the agent. We can seldom do more than get a _glimpse_ of objects in a carriage that is going with rapidity: when we do not wish to be observed to look, we take but a _glance_ at an object. 

####glitter

####gloaming 
**GLOAMING, EVENING, TWILIGHT.**  
Of these three terms _evening_ is the term which simply denotes the time of day — the beginning of night. The other two terms add to the denotation of time certain special connotations. _Gloaming_ is a poetic word found in the Anglo-Saxon compound _œfen-glommung_, literally evening-glow, from Anglo-Saxon _glowan_, to glow. It indicates the time just after sunset, when there is still a _glow_ of light in the western sky, but when the _gloom_ of night is fast falling. The word _gloaming_ has this double suggestion of both _gloom_ and _glow. Twilight_ signifies literally the time of half light, the space between day and night when light has not entirely given way to darkness. Compare Middle Dutch _tweelicht._

####globe 
**GLOBE, BALL.**  
_Globe_ comes from Latin _globus_, ball. _Ball_, Teutonic _ball_, is doubtless connected with the words _bowl, boil_, and the like, signifying that which is turned or rounded.  
_Globe_ is to _ball_ as the species to the genus; a _globe_ is a _ball_, but every _ball_ is not a _globe._ The _globe_ does not in its strict sense require to be of an equal rotundity in all its parts; it is properly an irregularly round body: a _ball_, on the other hand, is generally any round body, but particularly one that is entirely, regularly round; the earth itself is therefore properly denominated a _globe_ from its unequal rotundity: and for the same reason the mechanical body, which is made to represent the earth, is also denominated a _globe:_ but in the higher style of writing the earth is frequently denominated a _ball_, and in familiar discourse every solid body which assumes a circular form is entitled a _ball._  
See also [circle](entry://circle)

####gloom 
**GLOOM, HEAVINESS.**  
_Gloom_ has its source internally, and is often independent of outward circumstances; _heaviness_ is a weight upon the spirits produced by a foreign cause: the former belongs to the constitution; the latter is occasional. People of a melancholy habit have a particular _gloom_ hang over their minds which pervades all their thoughts; those who suffer under severe disappointments for the present, and have _gloomy_ prospects for the future, may be expected to be _heavy_ at heart; we may sometimes dispel the _gloom_ of the mind by the force of reflection, particularly by the force of religious contemplation: _heaviness_ of spirits is itself a temporary thing, and may be succeeded by vivacity or lightness of mind when the pressure of the moment has subsided.  
**GLOOMY, SULLEN, MOROSE, SPLENETIC.** — All these terms denote a temper of mind the reverse of easy or happy: _gloomy_ lies either in the general constitution or in the particular frame of the mind; _sullen_ lies in the temper: a man of a _gloomy_ disposition is an involuntary agent; it is his misfortune, and renders him in some measure pitiable: the _sullen_ man yields to his evil humors; _sullenness_ is his fault, and renders him offensive. The _gloomy_ man distresses himself most; his pains are all his own: the _sullen_ man has a great share of discontent in his composition; he charges his sufferings upon others, and makes them suffer in common with himself. A man may be rendered _gloomy_ for a time by the influence of particular circumstances; but _sullenness_ creates pains for itself when all external circumstances of a painful nature are wanting.  
_Sullenness_ and _moroseness_ are both the inherent properties of the temper; but the former discovers itself in those who have to submit, and the latter in those who have to command: _sullenness_ therefore betrays itself mostly in early life; _moroseness_ is the peculiar characteristic of age. The _sullen_ person has many fancied hardships to endure from the control of others; the _morose_ person causes others to endure many real hardships by keeping them under too severe a control. _Sullenness_ shows itself mostly by an unseemly reserve: _moroseness_ shows itself by the hardness of the speech and the roughness of the voice. _Sullenness_ is altogether a sluggish principle that leads more or less to inaction; _moroseness_ is a harsh feeling, that is, not contented with exacting obedience unless it inflicts pain.  
_Moroseness_ is a defect of the temper; but _spleen_ is a defect in the heart: the one betrays itself in behavior, the other more in conduct. A _morose_ man is an unpleasant companion; a _splenetic_ man is a bad member of society; the former is ill-natured to those about him, the latter is ill-humored with all the world. _Moroseness_ vents itself in temporary expressions; _spleen_ indulges itself in perpetual bitterness of expression.

####glory 
**GLORY, HONOR.**  
_Glory_ is something dazzling and widely diffused, from Latin _gloria._ That the moral idea of _glory_ is best represented by light is evident from the _glory_ which is painted round the head of our Saviour. _Honor_ is something less splendid, but more solid. It is derived from Latin _honorent_ (accusative), honor, reputation.  
_Glory_ impels to extraordinary efforts and to great undertakings. _Honor_ induces to a discharge of one's duty. Excellence in the attainment and success in the exploit bring _glory;_ a faithful exercise of one's talents reflects _honor. Glory_ is connected with everything which has a peculiar public interest; _honor_ is more properly obtained within a private circle. _Glory_ is not confined to the nation or life of the individual, by whom it is sought; it spreads over all the earth and descends to the latest posterity: _honor_ is limited to those who are connected with the subject of it and eye-witnesses to his actions. _Glory_ is attainable but by few, and may be an object of indifference to any one; _honor_ is more or less within the reach of all and must be disregarded by no one. A general at the head of an army goes in pursuit of _glory;_ the humble citizen who acts his part in society so as to obtain the approbation of his fellow-citizens is in the road for _honor._ A nation acquires _glory by_ the splendor of its victories and its superiority in arts as well as arms; it obtains _honor_ by its strict adherence to equity and good faith in all its dealings with other nations.  
_Glory_ is a sentiment selfish in its nature, but salutary or pernicious in its effect, according as it is directed; _honor_ is a principle disinterested in its nature and beneficial in its operations. A thirst for _glory_ is seldom indulged but at the expense of others, as it is not attainable in the plain path of duty; there are but few opportunities of acquiring it by elevated acts of goodness, and still fewer who have the virtue to embrace the opportunities that offer: a love of _honor_ can never be indulged but to the advantage of others; it is restricted by fixed laws; it requires a sacrifice of every selfish consideration and a due regard to the rights of others; it is associated with nothing but virtue.  
**GLORY, BOAST, VAUNT.** — To _glory_ is to hold as one's _glory._ To _boast_ is to set forth to one's advantage. To _vaunt_ is to set one's self up before others. The first two terms denote the value which the individual sets upon that which belongs to himself; the last term may be employed in respect to others.  
To _glory_ is more particularly the act of the mind, the indulgence of the internal sentiment: to _boast_ denotes rather the expression of the sentiment. To _glory_ is applied only to matters of moment; _boast_ is rather suitable to trifling points: the former is seldom used in a bad sense, the latter still seldomer in a good one. A Christian martyr _glories_ in the cross of Christ; a soldier _boasts_ of his courage and his feats in battle. To _vaunt_ is properly to proclaim praises aloud, and is taken either in an indifferent or bad sense. 

####gloss 
**GLOSS, VARNISH, PALLIATE.**  
_Gloss_ and _varnish_ are figurative terms, which borrow their signification from the act of making the outer surface of any physical object shine. To _gloss_ comes from a Scandinavian word signifying lustre, from a root meaning to glow; it means to give a glow or brightness to anything by means of friction, as in the case of japan or mahogany: to _varnish_ is to give an artificial _gloss_ by means of applying a foreign substance. Hence, in the figurative use of the terms, to _gloss is_ to put the best face upon anything by various artifices; but to _varnish_ is to do the same thing by means of direct falsehood; to _palliate_, which likewise signifies to give the best possible outside to a thing (see [extenuate](entry://extenuate)), requires still less artifice than either. One _glosses_ over that which is bad by giving it a soft name, as when a man's vices are _glossed_ over with the name of indiscretion or a man's mistress is termed his friend: one _varnishes_ a bad character by ascribing good motives to his bad actions, by withholding many facts that are to his discredit, and fabricating other circumstances in his favor; an _unvarnished_ tale contains nothing but the simple truth; the _varnished_ tale, on the other hand, contains a great mixture of falsehood: to _palliate_ is to diminish the magnitude of an offence by making an excuse in favor of the offender, as when an act of theft is _palliated_ by considering the starving condition of the thief.

####go 
**GO, ADVANCE, DEPART, PROCEED, TRAVEL.**  
_GO_ is a widely distributed Teutonic word. It is the generic term signifying to move in any direction. The other terms indicate particular kinds of going. _Advance_ and _proceed_ mean to _go_ forward (see [advance](entry://advance)). _Depart_, from Latin _de_, from, and _pars_, part, a separation, means to go away. _Travel_ means to go about for the sake of pleasure or sightseeing. 

####godlike 
**GODLIKE, DIVINE, HEAVENLY.**  
_Godlike_ bespeaks its own meaning, as like _God_, or after the manner of _God_, from the Teutonic word corresponding in meaning to Latin _Deus_, possibly signifying the being worshipped from a root meaning to worship. _Divine_, in Latin _divinus_, from _divus_ or _Deus_, signifies appertaining to _God. Heavenly_, or _heaven-like_, signifies like or appertaining to _heaven_, Anglo-Saxon _heofon. Godlike_ is a more expressive but less common term than _divine:_ the former is used only as an epithet of peculiar praise for an individual; _divine_ is generally employed for that which appertains to a superior being, in distinction from that which is human. Benevolence is a _godlike_ property: the _Divine_ image is stamped on the features of man, whence the face is called by Milton "the human face _divine. "_ As _divine_ is opposed to human, so is _heavenly_ to earthly; the term _Divine_ Being distinguishes the Creator from all other beings; but a _heavenly_ being denotes the agents or inhabitants of _heaven_, in distinction from earthly beings, or the inhabitants of earth. A _divine_ influence is to be sought for only by prayer to the Giver of all good things; but a _heavenly_ temper may be acquired by a steady contemplation of _heavenly_ things and an abstraction from those whichare earthly: the _Divine_ will is the foundation of all moral law and obligation; _heavenly_ joys are the fruit of all our labors in this earthly course. These terms are applied to other objects with similar distinction.  
**GODLY, RIGHTEOUS.** — _Godly_ is a contraction of _godlike. Righteous_ signifies conformable to _right_ or truth.  
These epithets are both used in a spiritual sense, and cannot, without an indecorous affectation of religion, be introduced into any other discourse than that which is properly spiritual. _Godliness_, in the strict sense, is that outward deportment which characterizes a heavenly temper; prayer, reading of the Scriptures, public worship, and every religious act enters into the signification of _godliness_, which at the same time supposes a temper of mind, not only to delight in, but to profit by such exercises: _righteousness_, on the other hand, comprehends Christian morality, in distinction from that of the heathen or unbeliever; a _righteous_ man does _right_, not only because it is _right_, but because it is agreeable to the will of his Maker and the example of his Redeemer; _righteousness_ is therefore to _godliness_ as the effect to the cause. The _godly_ man goes to the sanctuary and by converse with his Maker assimilates all his affections to the character of that Being whom he worships; when he leaves the sanctuary he proves the efficacy of his _godliness_ by his _righteous_ converse with his fellow-creatures. It is easy, however, for men to mistake the means for the end and to rest content with _godliness_ without _righteousness_, as too many are apt to do who seem to make their whole duty to consist in an attention to religious observances and in the indulgence of extravagant feelings. 

####gold 
**GOLD, GOLDEN.**  
These terms are both employed as epithets, but _gold_ is the substantive used in composition, and _golden_, the adjective, in ordinary use. The former is strictly applied to the metal of which the thing is made, as a _gold_ cup or a _gold_ coin; but the latter to whatever appertains to _gold_, whether properly or figuratively, as the _golden_ lion, the _golden_ crown, the _golden_ age, or a _golden_ harvest. 

####good 
**GOOD, GOODNESS.**  
_Good_ is a word which, under different forms, runs through all the Northern languages.  
_Good_ and _goodness_ are abstract terms, drawn from the same word; the former to denote the thing that is _good_, the latter the inherent _good_ property of persons or things. All _good_ comes from God, whose _goodness_ toward His creatures is unbounded. The good we do is determined by the tendency of the action; but our _goodness_ in doing it is determined by the motive of our actions. _Good_ is of a twofold nature, physical and moral, and is opposed to evil; _goodness_ is applicable either to the disposition of moral agents or to the qualities of inanimate objects; it is opposed to badness. By the order of Providence the most horrible convulsions are made to bring about _good;_ the _goodness_ or badness of any fruit depends upon its fitness to be enjoyed.

**GOOD, BENEFIT, ADVANTAGE.** — _Good_ is an abstract universal term which, in its unlimited sense, comprehends everything that can be conceived of as suited in all its parts to the end proposed. In this sense _benefit_ and _advantage_ are modifications of _good;_ but the term _good_ has likewise a limited application, which brings it to a just point of comparison with the other terms here chosen: the common idea which allies these words to one another is that of _good_ as it respects a particular object. _Good_ is here employed indefinitely; _benefit_ and _advantage_ are specified by some collateral circumstances. _Good_ is done without regard to the person who does it, or him to whom it is done; but _benefit_ has always respect to the relative condition of the giver and receiver, who must be both specified. Hence we say of a charitable man that he does much _good_, or that he bestows _benefits_ upon this or that individual. In like manner, when speaking of particular communities or society at large, we may say that it is for the _good_ of society or for the _good_ of mankind that every one submits to the sacrifice of some portion of his natural liberty; but it is for the _benefit_ of the poorer orders that the charitably disposed employ their money in charity.  
_Good_ is limited to no mode or manner, no condition of the person or the thing; it is applied indiscriminately: _benefit_ is more particularly applicable to the external circumstances of a person, as to his health, his improvement, his pecuniary condition, and the like; it is also confined in its application to persons only: we may counsel another for his _good_, although we do not counsel him for his _benefit;_ but we labor for the _benefit_ of another when we set apart for him the fruits of our labor: exercise is always attended with some _good_ to all persons; it is of particular _benefit_ to those who are of a lethargic habit: an indiscreet zeal does more harm than _good_ to the cause of religion; a patient cannot expect to derive _benefit_ from a medicine when he counteracts its effects.  
A _benefit_ is a positive and direct _good_, an _advantage_ is an adventitious and indirect _good:_ the _benefit_ serves to supply some want, to remove some evil and afford some sort of relief: an _advantage_ serves to promote some ulterior object. An _advantage_, therefore, will not be a _benefit_ unless it be turned to a _good_ use. Education may be a _benefit_ to a person if it enable him to procure a competence; a polite education is of _advantage_ to one who associates with the great. 

####good-nature 
**GOOD-NATURE, GOOD-HUMOR.**  
_Good-nature_ and _good-humor_ both imply the disposition to please and be pleased; but the former is habitual and permanent, the latter is temporary and partial: the former lies in the nature and frame of the mind, the latter in the state of the humors or spirits. A _good-natured_ man recommends himself at all times for his _good-nature;_ a _good-humored_ man recommends himself particularly as a companion: _good-nature_ displays itself by a readiness in doing kind offices; _good-humor_ is confined mostly to the ease and cheerfulness of one's outward deportment in social converse: _goodnature_ is apt to be guilty of weak compliances; _good-humor_ is apt to be succeeded by fits of peevishness and depression. _Good-nature_ is applicable only to the character of the individual; _good-humor_ may be said of a whole company: it is a mark of _good-nature_ in a man not to disturb the _good-humor_ of the company he is in by resenting the affront that is offered him by another.

####goods 
**GOODS, FURNITURE, CHATTELS, MOVABLES, EFFECTS.**  
All these terms are applied to such things as belong to an individual: the first term is the most general, both in sense and application; all the rest are species.  
_Furniture_ comprehends all household goods; wherefore in regard to an individual, supposing the house to contain all he has, the general is put for the specific term, as when one speaks of a person's moving his _goods_ for his _furniture:_ but in the strict sense _goods_ comprehends more than _furniture_, including not only that which is adapted for the domestic purposes of a family, but also everything which is of value to a person: the chairs and tables are a part of _furniture;_ papers, books, and money are included among his _goods:_ it is obvious, therefore, that _goods_, even in its most limited sense, is of wider import than _furniture. Chattels_, Old French _chatel_, comes from Late Latin _capitale_, capital, meaning property, and is a technical term in law, and therefore not so frequent in ordinary use, but still sufficiently employed to deserve notice. It comprehends that species of _goods_ which is in a special manner separated from one's person and house; a man's cattle, his implements of husbandry, the partial rights which he has in land or buildings, are all comprehended under _chattels:_ hence the propriety of the expression to seize a man's _goods_ and _chattels_, as denoting the disposable property which he has about his person or at a distance. _Movables_ comprehends all the other terms, in the limited application to property, as far as it admits of being removed from one place to the other; it is opposed either to fixtures, when, speaking of _furniture_, or to land as contrasted with _goods_ and _chattels. Effects_ is a term of nearly as extensive a signification as _goods_, but not so extensive in its application: whatever a man has that is of any supposed value, or convertible into money, is entitled, his _goods;_ whatever a man has that can effect, produce, or bring forth money by sale is entitled his _effects; goods_, therefore, is applied only to that which a man has at his own disposal; _effects_ more properly to that which is left at the disposal of others. A man makes a sale of his _goods_ on his removal from any place; his creditors or executors take care of his _effects_ either on his bankruptcy or decease; _goods_, in this case, is seldom employed but in the limited sense of what is removable, but _effects_ includes everything real as well as personal.  
**GOODS, POSSESSIONS, PROPERTY.** — All these terms are applicable to such things as are the means of enjoyment; but the former term respects the direct quality of producing enjoyment, the latter two have regard to the subject of the enjoyment; we consider _goods_ as they are real or imaginary, adapted or not adapted for the producing of real happiness; those who abound in the _goods_ of this world are not always the happiest; _possessions_ must be regarded as they are lasting or temporary; he who is anxious for earthly _possessions_ forgets that they are but transitory and dependent upon a thousand contingencies: _property_ is to be considered as it is legal or illegal, just or unjust; those who are anxious for great _property_ are not always scrupulous about the means by which it is to be obtained. The purity of a man's Christian character is in danger from an overweening attachment to earthly _goods;_ no wise man will boast the multitude of his _possessions_ when he reflects that if they do not leave him the time is not far distant when he must leave them; the validity of one's claim to _property_ which comes by inheritance is better founded than any other. 

####gorgeous 
**GORGEOUS, BRILLIANT, DAZZLING.**  
_Gorgeous_ has a curious derivation. It comes from the Old French _gorge_, throat (compare the slang phrase. "Get my gorge"), and originally meant proud, with reference to the swelling of the throat in pride. _Gorge_ itself comes from Latin _gurges_, a whirlpool, whence in Late Latin it came to signify the gullet, into which everything disappears as if into a whirlpool. _Gorgeous_ now signifies brightly colored with special reference to splendor and richness of effect. _Brilliant_ (for derivation see [brightness](entry://brightness)) also means very bright, but it suggests light primarily rather than color, or color in so far as it also has the qualities of light. _Dazzling_ indicates brightness of color or especially of light with special reference to the psychological effect upon the spectator. _Dazzle_ refers to the sudden blurring of the rays of light to the eye when it faces something very bright. A _dazzling_ light is something this side of a _blinding_ light. 

####govern 
**GOVERN, RULE, REGULATE.**  
_Govern_ is in French _gouverner_, Latin _guberno_, Greek _κυβερνάω. Rule_ and _regulate_ signify to bring under a _rule_ or make by _rule._  
The exercise of authority enters more or less into the signification of these terms; but to _govern_ implies the exercise likewise of judgment and knowledge. To _rule_ implies rather the unqualified exercise of power, the malting the will the _rule:_ a king _governs_ his people by means of wise laws and an upright administration: a despot _rules_ over a nation according to his arbitrary decision; if he have no principle, his _rule_ becomes an oppressive tyranny. These terms are applied either to persons or to things: persons _govern_ or _rule_ others; or they _govern, rule_ or _regulate_ things.  
In regard to persons _govern_ is always in a good sense, but _rule_ is sometimes taken in a bad sense; it is frequently associated with an abuse of power: to _govern_ is so perfectly discretionary that we speak of _governing_ ourselves; but we speak only of _ruling_ others: nothing can be more lamentable than to be _ruled_ by one who does not know how to _govern_ himself: it is the business of a man to _ride his_ house by keeping all its members in due subjection to his authority: it is the duty of a person to _rule_ those who are under him in all matters wherein they are incompetent to _govern_ themselves.  
In application to things, _govern_ and _rule_ admit of a similar distinction: a minister _governs_ the state and a pilot _governs_ the vessel: the movements of the machine are in both cases directed by the exercise of the judgment; a person _rules_ the times, seasons, fashions, and the like; it is an act of the individual will. _Regulate is_ a species of _governing_ simply by judgment; the word is applicable to things of minor moment, where the force of authority is not so requisite: one _governs_ the affairs of a nation or a large body where great interests are involved; we _regulate_ the concerns of an individual, or we _regulate_ in cases where good order or convenience only is consulted: so likewise in regard to ourselves, we _govern_ our passions, but we _regulate_ our affections.  
These terms are all properly used to denote the acts of conscious agents, but by a figure of personification they may be applied to inanimate or moral objects: the price of one market _governs_ the price of another, or _governs_ the seller in his demand; fashion and caprice _ride_ the majority, or particular fashions _rule_ them: the time of one clock _regulates_ that of many others.  
**GOVERNMENT, ADMINISTRATION.** — Both these terms may be employed either to designate the act of _governing_ and _administering_ or the persons _governing_ and _administering._ In both cases _government_ has a more extensive meaning than _administration:_ the former includes every exercise of authority, while _administration_ implies only that exercise of authority which consists in putting the laws or will of another in force.  
When we speak of the _government_ as it respects the persons, it implies the whole body of constituted authorities; and the _administration_, only that part which puts in execution the intentions of the whole: the _government_ of a country, therefore, may remain unaltered, while the _administration_ undergoes many changes: it is the business of the _government_ to make treaties of peace and war; and without a _government_ it is impossible for any people to negotiate: it is the business of the _administration_ to _administer_ justice, to regulate the finances, and to direct all the complicated concerns of a nation; without an _administration_ all public business would be at a stand.  
**GOVERNMENT, CONSTITUTION.** — _Government_ is here, as in the former article, the general term; _constitution_ the specific. _Government_ implies generally the act of _governing_, or exercising authority under any form whatever; _constitution_ implies any _constituted_ or fixed form of _government:_ we may have a _government_ without a _constitution;_ we cannot have a _constitution_ without a _government._ In the first formation of society, _government_ was placed in the hands of individuals who exercised authority according to discretion rather than any positive rule or law; here then was _government_ without a _constitution:_ as time and experience proved the necessity of some established form, and the wisdom of enlightened men discovered the advantages and disadvantages of different forms, _government_ in every country assumed a more definite shape and became the _constitution_ of the country; hence then the union of _government_ and _constitution. Governments_ are divided by political writers into three classes, monarchical, aristocratic, and republican; but these three general forms have been adopted with such variations and modifications as to impart to the _constitution_ of every country something peculiar. The term _constitution_ is now particularly applied to any popular form of _government_, or any _government_ formed at the pleasure of the people, and in a still more restricted sense to the _government_ of England.

####grace 
**GRACE, FAVOR.**  
_Grace_, in French _grâce_, Latin _gratia_, comes from _gratus_, kind, because a _grace_ results from pure kindness, independently of the merit of the receiver; but _favor_ is that which is granted voluntarily and without hope of recompense, independently of all obligation.  
_Grace_ is never used but in regard to those who have offended and made themselves liable to punishment; _favor_ is employed for actual good. An act of _grace_, in the spiritual sense, is that merciful influence which God exerts over His most unworthy creatures from the infinite goodness of His Divine nature; it is to His special _grace_ that we attribute every good feeling by which we are prevented from committing sin: the term _favor_ is employed indiscriminately with regard to man or his Maker; those who are in power have the greatest opportunity of conferring _favors;_ but all we receive at the hands of our Maker must be acknowledged as a _favor._  
**GRACE, CHARM.** — _Grace_ is altogether corporeal; _charm_ is either corporeal or mental: the _grace_ qualifies the action of the body; the _charm_ is an inherent quality in the body itself. A lady moves, dances, and walks with _grace;_ the _charms_ of her person are equal to those of her mind.  
**GRACEFUL, COMELY, ELEGANT.** — A _graceful_ figure is rendered so by the deportment of the body. A _comely_ figure has that in itself which pleases the eye. _Gracefulness_ results from nature improved by art; _comeliness_ is mostly the work of nature. It is possible to acquire _gracefulness_ by the aid of the dancing-master, but for a _comely_ form we are indebted to nature aided by circumstances. _Grace_ is a quality pleasing to the eye; but _elegance_, from the Latin _e_, out, and _legere_, to choose, meaning worthy of being chosen out, is a quality of a higher nature, that inspires admiration; _elegant_ is applicable, like _graceful_, to the motion of the body, or like _comely_ to the person, and is extended in its meaning also to language, and even to dress. A person's step is _graceful;_ his air or his movements are _elegant;_ the _grace_ of an action lies chiefly in its adaptation to the occasion.   
See also [becoming](entry://becoming)  
**GRACIOUS, MERCIFUL, KIND.** — _Gracious_, when compared with _merciful_, is used only in the spiritual sense; the latter is applicable to the conduct of man as well as of the Deity. _Grace_ is exerted in doing good to an object that has merited the contrary; _mercy_ is exerted in withholding the evil which has been merited. God is _gracious_ to His creatures in affording them not only an opportunity to address Him, but every encouragement to lay open their wants to Him; their un worthiness and sinfulness are not made impediments of access to Him. God is _merciful_ to the vilest of sinners, and lends an ear to the smallest breath of repentance; in the moment of executing vengeance He stops His arm at the voice of supplication: He expects the same _mercy_ to be extended by man toward his offending brother. An act of _grace_ in the largest sense, as not only independent of, but opposite to, the merits of the person, is properly ascribable to God alone, but by analogy it has also been considered as the prerogative of earthly princes: thus we speak of acts of _grace_, by which insolvent debtors are released: in like manner, the _grace_ of the sovereign may be exerted in various ways.  
_Gracious_, when compared with _kind_, differs principally as to the station of the persons to whom it is applied. _Gracious_ is altogether confined to superiors; _kind_ is indiscriminately employed for superiors and equals: a king gives a _gracious_ reception to the nobles who are presented to him; one friend gives a _kind_ reception to another by whom he is visited. _Gracious_ is a term in peculiar use at court and among princes. _Kindness_ is a domestic virtue; it is found mostly among those who have not so much ceremonial to dispense with.

####grandeur 
**GRANDEUR, MAGNIFICENCE.**  
_Grandeur_ comes from _grand_, in French _grand_, great, Latin _grandis_, great. _Magnificence_, in Latin _magnificentia_, from _magnus_, great, and _facere_, to make, signifies making or acting on a large scale.  
An extensive assemblage of striking qualities in the exterior constitutes the common signification of these terms, of which _grandeur_ is the genus and _magnificence_ the species. _Magnificence_ cannot exist without _grandeur_, but _grandeur_ exists without _magnificence:_ the former is distinguished from the latter both in degree and in application. When applied to the same objects, they differ in degree, _magnificence_ being the highest degree of _grandeur._ As it respects the style of living, _grandeur_ is within the reach of subjects; _magnificence_ is mostly confined to princes.

####gratify 
**GRATIFY, INDULGE, HUMOR.**  
To _gratify_, make _grateful_ or _pleasant_ (see [acceptable](entry://acceptable)), is a positive act of the choice. To _indulge_ (for derivation see [foster](entry://foster)) is a negative act of the will, a yielding of the mind to circumstances. One _gratifies_ his desires or appetites and _indulges_ his humors, or _indulges_ in pleasures: by the former, one seeks to get the pleasure which the desire promises; by the latter, one yields to the influences which the humor or passion exercises. _Gratifying_ as a habit becomes a vice, and _indulging_ as a habit is a weakness. In this sense of the words, _gratification_ is mostly applied to mental objects, as to _gratify_ one's curiosity; _indulgence_, to matters of sense or partial feeling, as to _indulge_ one's palate. A person who is in search of pleasure _gratifies_ his desires as they rise; he lives for the _gratification_, and depends upon it for his happiness. He who has higher objects in view than the momentary _gratification_ will be careful not to _indulge_ himself too much in such things as will wean him from his purpose.  
As occasional acts, _gratify_ and _indulge_ may be both innocent.  
We _gratify_ and _indulge_ others as well as ourselves, and mostly in the good sense: to _gratify_ is for the most part in return for services; it is an act of generosity: to _indulge_ is to yield to the wishes or be lenient to the infirmities of others; it is an act of kindness or good-nature. To _humor_ is mostly taken in a bad sense.

####gratuitous 
**GRATUITOUS, VOLUNTARY.**  
_Gratuitous_ is opposed to that which is obligatory. _Voluntary_ is opposed to that which is compulsory or involuntary. A gift is _gratuitous_ when it flows entirely from the free will of the giver, independently of right: an offer is _voluntary_ which flows from the free will independently of all external constraint. _Gratuitous_ is therefore to _voluntary_ as a species to the genus. What is _gratuitous_ is _voluntary_, although what is _voluntary_ is not always _gratuitous._ The _gratuitous_ is properly the _voluntary_ in regard to the disposal of one's property; and the _voluntary_ is applicable to all other actions.  
**GRATUITY, RECOMPENSE.** — The distinction between these terms is very similar to the above. They both imply a gift, and a gift by way of return for some supposed service; but the _gratuity_ is independent of all expectation as well as right: the _recompense_ is founded upon some admissible claim. Those who wish to confer a favor in a delicate manner will sometimes do it under the shape of a _gratuity:_ those who overrate their services will in all probability be disappointed in the _recompense_ they receive. 

####grave 
**GRAVE, SERIOUS, SOLEMN.**  
_Grave_, in Latin _gravis_, heavy, denotes the weight which keeps the mind or person down and prevents buoyancy; it is opposed to the light. _Serious_, Latin _serius_, possibly allied to German _schwer_, heavy, marks the quality of slowness or considerateness, either in the mind or that which occupies the mind: it is opposed to the jocose.  
_Grave_ expresses more than _serious;_ it does not merely bespeak the absence of mirth, but that heaviness of mind which is displayed in all the movements of the body; _seriousness_, on the other hand, bespeaks no depression, but simply steadiness of action and a refrainment from all that is jocular. A man may be _grave_ in his walk, in his tone, in his gesture, in his looks, and all his exterior; he is _serious_ only in bis general air, his countenance, and demeanor. _Gravity_ is produced by some external circumstance, _seriousness_ springs from the operation of the mind itself or from circumstances. Misfortunes or age will produce _gravity: seriousness_ is the fruit of reflection. _Gravity_ is, in the proper sense, confined to the person, as a characteristic of his temper; _serious_, on the other hand, is a characteristic either of persons or of things: hence we should speak of a _grave_ assembly, not a _serious_ assembly, of old men; _grave_ senators, not _serious_ senators; of a _grave_ speaker, not a _serious_ speaker: but a _serious_, not a _grave_ sermon; a _serious_, not a _grave_ writer; but _grave_ is sometimes extended to things in the sense of weight, as when we speak of _grave_ matters of deliberation, a _grave_ objection, sentiment. _Gravity_ is peculiarly ascribed to a judge, from the double cause that much depends upon his deportment, in which there ought to be _gravity_, and that the weighty concerns which press on his mind are most apt to produce_ gravity:_ on the other hand, both _gravity_ and _seriousness_ may be applied to the preacher; the former only as it respects the manner of delivery; the latter as it respects especially the matter of his discourse: the person may be _grave_ or _serious;_ the discourse only is _serious. Solemn_ expresses more than either _grave_ or _serious_, from the Latin _solennis_, yearly; as applied to the stated religious festivals of the Romans, it has acquired the collateral meaning of religious _gravity:_ like _serious_, it is employed not so much to characterize either the person or the thing: a judge pronounces the _solemn_ sentence of condemnation in a _solemn_ maimer; a preacher delivers many _solemn_ warnings to his hearers. _Gravity_ may be the effect of corporeal habit, and _seriousness_ of mental habit; but _solemnity_ is something occasional and extraordinary. Some children exhibit a remarkable _gravity_ as soon as they begin to observe; a regular attention to religious Worship will induce a habit of _seriousness;_ the admonitions of a parent on his death-bed will have peculiar _solemnity._

**GRAVE, TOMB, SEPULCHRE.** — All these terms denote the place where bodies are deposited. _Grave_, in this sense, comes from Anglo-Saxon _grafan_, to cut or dig, and signifies something cut or dug out, especially the hollow made in the earth. _Tomb_, Latin _tumba_, Greek _τύμβα_, is allied to _tumulus_, a mound, and _tumere_, to swell, and has reference to the rising above a grave. _Sepulchre_, from _sepelio_, bury, has a reference to the use for which it is employed. From this explanation it is evident that these terms have a certain propriety of application: "To sink into the _grave"_ is an expression that carries the thoughts where the body must rest in death, consequently to death itself: "To inscribe on the _tomb_, or to encircle the _tomb_ with flowers, " carries our thoughts to the external of that place in which the body is interred. To inter in a _sepulchre_, or to visit or enter a _sepulchre_, reminds us of a place in which bodies are deposited, or, by a figure, where anything may be buried.

####great 
**GREAT, LARGE, BIG.**  
_Great_, in Anglo-Saxon _great_, is applied to all kinds of dimensions in which things can grow or increase. _Large_, in Latin _largus_, wide, is properly applied to space, extent, and quantity. _Big_, Middle English _big_, is probably of Scandinavian origin; it denotes _great_ as to expansion or capacity. A house, a room, a heap, a pile, an army, etc., are _great_ or _large;_ an animal or a mountain is _great_ or _big:_ a road, a city, a street, and the like, are termed rather _great_ than _large. Great_ is used generally in the improper sense; _large_ and _big_ are used only occasionally: a noise, a distance, a multitude, a number, a power, and the like, are termed _great_, but not _large:_ we may, however, speak of a _large_ portion, a _large_ share, a _large_ quantity; or of a mind _big_ with conception, or of an event _big_ with the fate of nations.  
_Great, Grand, Sublime_. — These terms are synonymous only in their moral applications. _Great_ simply designates extent; _grand_ includes likewise the idea of excellence and superiority. A _great_ undertaking characterizes only the extent of the undertaking; a _grand_ undertaking bespeaks its superior excellence: _great_ objects are seen with facility; _grand_ objects are viewed with admiration. It is a _great_ point to make a person sensible of his faults; it should be the _grand_ aim of all to aspire after moral and religious improvement.  
_Grand_ and _sublime_ are both superior to _great;_ but the former marks the dimensions of _greatness;_ the latter, from the Latin _sublimis_, designates that of height. A scene may be either _grand_ or _sublime:_ it is _grand_ as it fills the imagination with its immensity; it is _sublime_ as it elevates the imagination beyond the surrounding and less important objects. There is something _grand_ in the sight of a vast army moving forward, as it were, by one impulse; there is something peculiarly _sublime_ in the sight of huge mountains and craggy cliffs of ice shaped into various fantastic forms. _Grand_ may be said of the works of either art or nature; _sublime_ is peculiarly applicable to the works of nature. The Egyptian pyramids and the ocean are both _grand_ objects; a tempestuous ocean is a _sublime_ object. _Grand_ is sometimes applied to the mind; _sublime_ is applied both to the thoughts and to the expressions.

####greedy 
**GREEDY, AVARICIOUS, GRASPING, RAPACIOUS, SELFISH.**  
_Greedy_, in Anglo-Saxon _grœdig_, from a Teutonic root meaning to be hungry, signifies the state of a person or animal that has a keen appetite for food or drink or an eagerness for anything earnestly desired. The latter implication is the most common one in the relation of the term to persons, and, with the possible exception of being _greedy_ or intensely anxious to obtain useful knowledge, the term _greedy_ indicates a wholly reprehensible quality, though it is to be admitted that many persons are born into that quality or state and in later life fail to escape from it. Such may be more pardonable than those of maturity who knowingly enter that state.  
The _avaricious_ person is one who is possessed, nay, controlled, by an inordinate or insatiable desire for gain, without any consideration of the element of need. He wants something because he has none of it now, because his neighbor has it, because he wants to increase the quantity of it that he already possesses, and for all manner of reasons, but decidedly because he _wants_ it.  
The _grasping_ person is not only _avaricious_, that quality giving him a motive, but he is covetous of the possessions of others, desirous of obtaining them, jealous of the possessor because of his possessions, and very apt to reach out, stretch forth, commit some underhand, act, or take a mean advantage of another to accomplish his desire. The _rapacious_ person is more of an extremist, for he is addicted to plunderings, forcible seizures, severe exactions, heartless extortions, and preposterous demands for whatever he desires.  
The _selfish_ person lives only for one person — himself; is attentive only to his own interests; is influenced in his actions by motives of personal advantage only; and, to use a familiar colloquialism, "Wants the whole earth and everything in it. " He, too, is jealous of others who have more of this world's goods than himself, covets whatever others have, and is the only person on earth to be considered under all circumstances — in his own estimation. 

####green 
**GREEN, VERDANT.**  
_Green_, in Anglo-Saxon _grene_, is allied to grow, and signifies the color of growing things — of grass and herbage. _Verdant_, Old French _verd_, green, Latin _viridus_, green, is the Latin corresponding to Anglo-Saxon _green. Green_ denotes simply the color green. _Verdant_ suggests lusty and flourishing vegetable life. _Green_ makes a clearer impression upon the sensuous imagination; _verdant_ suggests more to the mind. It is a less definite word, but richer in associations. Both terms are applied figuratively to some one who is ignorant or young — _green_ with a definite implied comparison with unripe fruits or vegetable growth; _verdant_ as a humorous substitute for _green._

####grievance 
**GRIEVANCE, HARDSHIP.**  
_Grievance_, from the Latin _gravis_, heavy or burdensome, implies that which lies heavy at heart. _Hardship_, from the adjective _hard_, denotes that which presses or bears violently on the person.  
_Grievance_ is in general taken for that which is done by another to _grieve_ or distress: _hardship_ is a particular kind of _grievance_ that presses upon individuals. There are national _grievances_, though not national _hardships._ An infraction of one's rights, an act of violence or oppression, are _grievances_ to those who are exposed to them, whether as individuals or bodies of men: an unequal distribution of labor, a partial indulgence of one to the detriment of another, constitute the _hardship._ A weight of taxes, levied in order to support an unjust war, will be esteemed a _grievance:_ the partiality and caprice of the collector in making it fall with unequal weight upon particular persons will be regarded as a peculiar _hardship._ Men seek a redress of their _grievances_ from some higher power than that by which they are inflicted: they endure their _hardships_ until an opportunity offers of getting them removed.  
**GRIEVE, MOURN, LAMENT.** — To _grieve_ (see **affliction** under [afflict](entry://afflict)) is the general term; _mourn_, like _murmur_, being an imitation of the sound produced by pain, is a particular term. To _grieve_, in its limited sense, is an inward act; to _mourn_ is an outward act: the _grief_ lies altogether in the mind; the _mourning_ displays itself by some outward mark. A man _grieves_ for his sins; he _mourns_ for the loss of his friends. One _grieves_ for that which immediately concerns one's self, or that which concerns others; one _mourns_ for that which concerns others; one _grieves_ over the loss of property; one _mourns_ the fate of a deceased relative.  
_Grieve_, from Old French _grever_, Latin _gravis_, is the act of an individual; _mourn_ may be the common act of many: a nation _mourns_, though it does not _grieve_, for a public calamity. To _grieve_ is applicable to domestic troubles; _mourn_ may refer to public or private ills. The distractions of a state will cause many to _grieve_ for their own losses and _mourn_ the misfortunes of their country.  
_Grieve_ and _mourn_ are permanent sentiments; _lament_ (see [bewail](entry://bewail)) is a transitory feeling: the former are produced by substantial causes, which come home to the feelings: the latter respects things of a more partial, oftentimes of a more remote and indifferent, nature. A real widow _mourns_ all the remainder of her days for the loss of her husband; we _lament_ a thing to-day which we may forget to-morrow. _Mourn_ and _lament_ are both expressed by some outward sign; but the former is composed and free from all noise; the latter displays itself either in cries or simple words. In the moment of trouble, when the distress of the mind is at its height, it may break out into loud _lamentation_, but commonly _grieving_ and _mourning_ commence when _lamentation_ ceases.  
As epithets, _grievous, mournful_, and _lamentable_ have a similar distinction. What presses hard or unjustly on persons, their property, connections, and circumstances, is _grievous;_ what touches the tender feelings, and tears asunder the ties of kindred and friendship, is _mournful;_ whatever excites a painful sensation in our mind is _lamentable._ Famine is a _grievous_ calamity for a nation; the violent separation of friends by death _is_, a _mournful_ event at all times, but particularly so for those who are in the prime of life and the fulness of expectation; the ignorance which some persons discover even in the present cultivated state of society is truly _lamentable._

####groan 
**GROAN, MOAN.**  
_Groan_, in Anglo-Saxon _granian_, may be allied to _grin. Groan_ and _moan_, however, both have the effect of onomatopœtic words. _Groan_ is a deep sound produced by hard breathing: _moan_ is a plaintive, long-drawn sound produced by the organs of utterance. The _groan_ proceeds involuntarily as an expression of severe pain, either of body or of mind: the _moan_ proceeds often from the desire of awakening attention or exciting compassion. Dying _groans_ are uttered in the agonies of death: the _moans_ of a wounded sufferer are sometimes the only resource he has left to make his destitute case known. 

####gross 
**GROSS, COARSE.**  
_Gross_ comes from Latin _grossus_, thick, fat. _Coarse_ (see [coarse](entry://coarse)).  
These terms are synonymous in the moral application. _Grossness_ of habit is opposed to delicacy; _coarseness_ to softness and. refinement. A person becomes _gross_ by an unrestrained indulgence of his sensual appetites, particularly in eating and drinking; he is _coarse_ from the want of polish, as to either his mind or his manners. A _gross_ sensualist approximates very nearly to the brute; he sets aside all moral considerations; he indulges himself in the open face of day in defiance of all decency: a _coarse_ person approaches nearest to the savage, whose roughness of humor and inclination has not been refined down by habits of restraining his own will and complying with the will of another. A _gross_ expression conveys the idea of that which should be kept from the view of the mind which shocks the moral feeling; a _coarse_ expression conveys the idea of an unseemly sentiment in the mind of the speaker. The representations of the Deity by any sensible image is _gross_, because it gives us a low and grovelling idea of a superior being; the doing a kindness, and making the receiver at the same time sensible of your superiority and his dependence, indicates great _coarseness_ in the character of the favorer.  
**GROSS, TOTAL.** — From the idea of size which enters into the original meaning of _gross_ is derived that of quantity. _Total_, from the Latin _totus_, signifies literally the whole: the _gross_ implies that from which nothing has been taken: the _total_ signifies that to which, nothing need be added: the _gross_ sum includes everything without regard to what it may be; the _total_ includes everything which one wishes to include; we may, therefore, deduct from the _gross_ that which does not immediately belong to it; but the _total_ is that which admits of no deduction. The _gross_ weight in trade is applicable to any article the whole of which, good or bad, pure or dross, is included in opposition to the net weight; the _total_ amount supposes all to be included which ought to form a part, in opposition to any smaller amount or subdivisions; when employed in the improper, sense, they preserve the same distinction: things are said to be taken or considered in the _gross_, that is, in the large and comprehensive way, one with another; things are said to undergo a _total_ change.

####guarantee 
**GUARANTEE, BE SECURITY, BE RESPONSIBLE, WARRANT.**  
_Guarantee_ and _warrant_ are both derived from Old High German _werent_, present participle of _weren_, to certify to, to warrant; _security_, from _secure_ (see [certain](entry://certain)), has the same original meaning; _responsible_ (see [amenable](entry://amenable)).  
To _guarantee_ and _be security_ have respect to what is, done for others: to _be responsible_ respects what is done by one's self or others; to _warrant_, what is done by one's self only. To _guarantee_ is applied to matters of public or private interest; to _be security_, to private matters only. The larger governments frequently _guarantee_ for the performance of stipulations entered into by minor powers; one man becomes _security_ to another for the payment of a sum of money by a third person. _Guarantee_ may be taken for the person or thing that guarantees.  
One is _security_ for another in pecuniary concerns, but he is _responsible_ for his own conduct or that of others; he becomes a _security_ by virtue of his contract, as one tradesman becomes _security_ for another — he is _responsible_ by virtue of his relative office or situation; masters are _responsible_ for the conduct of their servants; a jailer is _responsible_ for the safe custody of the prisoner; every man is _responsible_ for that which is placed under his charge. To _warrant_ is applied to commercial transactions: one _warrants_ the goodness of any commodity that is sold.  
The _warrant_ serves to indemnify against loss, or, in a moral sense, to protect against censure, to give a sanction to. 

####guard 
**GUARD, DEFEND, WATCH.**  
_Guard_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _weardian_, to watch, the _gu_ being due to French influence. _Defend_ (see [apologize ](entry://apologize )and DEFEND). _Watch_ and _wake_ come from Anglo-Saxon _wacan_, to wake.  
To _guard_, in its largest sense, comprehends both _watching_ and _defending_, that is, both the preventing the attack and the resisting it when it is made. In the restricted sense, to _guard_ is properly to keep off an enemy; to _defend_ is to drive him away when he makes the attack. The soldier _guards_ the palace of the king in time of peace, and _defends_ his country in time of war.  
_Watch_, like _guard_, consists in looking to the danger, but it does not necessarily imply the use of any means to prevent the danger: he who _watches_ may only give an alarm.  
In the improper application they have a similar sense: modesty _guards_ female honor; clothing _defends_ against the inclemency of the weather: a person who wants to escape _watches_ his opportunity to slip out unobserved. See also [fence](entry://fence)  
**GUARD, SENTINEL.** — These terms are used to designate those who are employed for the projection of either persons or things. _Guard_ has been explained above. _Sentinel_, in French _sentinelle_, Italian _sentinella_, a watch, possibly from _Latin sentire_, to perceive, signifies a military _guard_ in the time of a campaign; any one may be set as _guard_ over property, who is empowered to keep off every intruder by force; but the _sentinel_ acts in the army as the watch in the police, rather to observe the motions of the enemy than to repel any force.  
They are figuratively applied to other objects; the _guard_ in this case acts on ordinary occasions, the _sentinel_ in the moments of danger.  
**GUARD, GUARDIAN.** — These words are derived from the verb _guard;_ but they have acquired a distinct office. _Guard_ is used either in the literal or figurative sense; _guardian_ only in the improper sense. _Guard_ is applied either to persons or to things; _guardian_ only to persons. In application to persons, the _guard_ is temporary; the _guardian_ is fixed and permanent: the _guard_ only _guards_ against external evils; the _guardian_ takes upon him the office of parent, counsellor, and director: when a house is in danger of being attacked, a person may sit up as a _guard;_ when a parent is dead, a _guardian_ supplies his place: we expect from a _guard_ nothing but human assistance; but from our _guardian_ angel we may expect supernatural assistance.  
**GUARD AGAINST, TAKE HEED.** — Both these terms imply express care on the part of the agent; but the former is used with regard to external or internal evils, the latter only with regard to internal or mental evils: in an enemy's country it is essential to be particularly on one's _guard_, for fear of a surprise; in difficult matters, where we are liable to err, it is of importance to _take heed_ lest we run from one extreme to another: young men, on their entrance into life, cannot be too much on their _guard against_ associating with those who would lead them into expensive pleasures; in slippery paths, whether physically or morally understood, it is necessary to _take heed_ how we go. 

####guardian 
See [guard](entry://guard)

####guess 
**GUESS, CONJECTURE, DIVINE.**  
_Guess_ is a Scandinavian word. _Conjecture_ (see that word). _Divine_, from the Latin _divinus_ and _deus_, a god, signifies to think and know as a god.  
We _guess_ that a thing actually is; we _conjecture_ that which may be; we _guess_ that it is a certain hour; we _conjecture_ as to the meaning of a person's actions. _Guessing_ is opposed to the certain knowledge of a thing; _conjecturing_ is opposed to the full conviction of a thing: a child _guesses_ at that portion of his lesson which he has not properly learned; a fanciful person employs _conjecture_ where he cannot draw any positive conclusion.  
To _guess_ and _conjecture_ are natural acts of the mind: to _divine_, in its proper sense, is a supernatural act; in this sense the heathens affected to _divine_ that which was known only to an Omniscient Being; and impostors in our time presume to _divine_ in matters that are set above the reach of human comprehension. The term is, however, employed to denote a species of _guessing_ in different matters, as to _divine_ the meaning of a mystery. 

####guest 
**GUEST, VISITOR, VISITANT.**  
_Guest_ is a Scandinavian word from the same root as Latin _hastes_, signifying a stranger or an enemy; _visitor_ or _visitant_ is the one who pays the visit. The _guest_ is to the _visitor_ as the species to the genus: every _guest_ is a _visitor_, but every _visitor_ is not a _guest;_ the _visitor_ simply comes to see the person and enjoy social intercourse; but the _guest_ also partakes of hospitality: we are _visitors_ at the tea-table, at the card-table, and round the fire; we are _guests_ at the festive board. 

####guide 
**GUIDE, RULE.**  
_Guide_ is to _rule_ as the genus to the species: every _rule_ is a _guide_ to a certain extent; but the _guide_ is often that which exceeds the _rule._ The _guide_, in the moral sense, as in the proper sense, goes with us and points out the exact path; it does not permit us to err either to the right or left: the _rule_ marks out a line beyond which we may not go; but it leaves us to trace the line, and consequently to fail either on the one side 01 on the other. The Bible is our best _guide_ for moral practice; its doctrines, as interpreted in the articles of the Christian Church, are the best _rule_ of faith.

####guile

####guiltless 
**GUILTLESS, INNOCENT, HARMLESS.**  
_Guiltless_, without _guilt_, is more than _innocent: innocence_, from _nocere_, to hurt, extends no further than the quality of not hurting by any direct act; _guiltless_ comprehends the quality of not intending to hurt: it is possible, therefore, to be _innocent_ without being _guiltless_, though not _vice versa;_ he who wishes for the death of another is not _guiltless_, though he may be _innocent_ of the crime of murder. _Guiltless_ seems to regard a man's general condition, _innocent_ his particular condition: no man is _guiltless_ in the sight of God, for no man is exempt from the guilt of sin; but he may be _innocent_ in the sight of men, or _innocent_ of all such intentional offences as render him obnoxious to his fellow-creatures. _Guiltlessness_ was that happy state of perfection which men lost at the fall; _innocence_ is that relative or comparative state of perfection which is attainable here on earth: the highest state of _innocence_ is an ignorance of evil.  
_Guiltless_ is in the proper sense applicable only to the condition of man, and, when applied to things, it still has a reference to the person: _innocent_ is equally applicable to persons or things; a person is _innocent_ who has not committed any injury or has not any direct purpose to commit any injury; or a conversation is _innocent_ which is free from what is hurtful. _Innocent_ and _harmless_ both recommend themselves as qualities negatively good; they designate a freedom either in the person or in the thing from injuring, and differ only in regard to the nature of the injury: _innocence_ respects moral injury, and _harmless_ physical injury: a person is _innocent_ who is free from moral impurity and wicked purposes; he is _harmless_ if he have not the power or disposition to commit any violence; a diversion is _innocent_ which has nothing in it likely to corrupt the morals; a game is _harmless_ which is not likely to inflict any wound or endanger the health. 

####guilty 
See **criminal** under [crime](entry://crime)

####guise 
**GUISE, HABIT.**  
_Guise_ is the French form of English _wise_, both from a Teutonic root, and both signifying the manner. _Habit_, from the Latin _habitus_, a habit, fashion, or form, is taken for a settled or permanent mode of dress.  
The _guise_ is that which is unusual and often only occasional; the _habit_ is that which is usual among particular classes: a person sometimes assumes the _guise_ of a peasant, in order the better to conceal himself; he who devotes himself to the clerical profession puts on the _habit_ of a clergyman. 

####gulf 
**GULF, ABYSS.**  
_Gulf_, French _golfe_, Italian _golfo_, comes from Greek _κόλπος_, hollow, and is applied literally in the sense of a deep concave receptacle for water, as the _gulf_ of Venice, _gulf_ of Mexico, etc. _Abyss_, in Greek _άβυσσος_, compounded of _ά-_ and _βυσσός_, a bottom, signifies literally a bottomless pit.  
One is overwhelmed in a _gulf;_ it carries with it the idea of liquidity and profundity, into which one inevitably sinks never to rise: one is lost in an _abyss;_ it carries with it the idea of immense profundity, into which he who is cast never reaches a bottom, nor is able to return to the top; an insatiable voracity is the characteristic idea in the signification of this term.  
A _gulf_ is a capacious bosom, which holds within itself and buries all objects that suffer themselves to sink into it, without allowing them the possibility of escape; hell is represented as a fiery _gulf_, into which evil spirits are plunged, and remain perpetually overwhelmed: a guilty mind may be said, figuratively, to be plunged into a _gulf_ of woe or despair when filled with the horrid sense of its enormities. An _abyss_ presents nothing but an interminable space which has neither beginning nor end; he does wisely who does not venture in, or who retreats before he has plunged too deep to retrace his footsteps; as the ocean, in the natural sense, is a great _abyss_, so are metaphysics an immense _abyss_ into which the human mind precipitates itself only to be bewildered. 

####gumption 
**GUMPTION, ACUTENESS, CLEVERNESS, DISCERNMENT, SHREWDNESS.**  
_Gumption_ is a Scandinavian word. The term is one of colloquial usage, implying, as a substantive, a quickness of perception, the possession of much common sense, and, in painting, the art of preparing colors. We say that a person is possessed of _gumption_ who exhibits a quick-acting intellectuality, who perceives the drift, heart, spirit, of things speedily, whose mental activities evidence sharpness, keenness, _acuteness. Cleverness_ expresses more than _acuteness_, for it is that state or quality which enables its possessor to exercise a special skill or ability on certain lines, to be dexterous, expert, handy, adroit, to act expeditiously and efficiently with mind and body, and in intercourse with his fellow-men to be good-natured and obliging. _Shrewdness_, in a proper sense, implies sagacity, ingenuity, intelligence, "mother-wit, " and cleverness in practical matters; in an improper sense, craftiness, cunning, slyness, depravity, and iniquity.  
_Discernment_ is an act of perception, an acuteness or sharpness in judgment, a penetrative ability, and, specifically, the quality of discrimination, the mental condition of being able to weigh, analyze, segregate, and classify objects so that each may be considered by itself, and the relation of a part to the whole may be clearly determined.

####haggard 
**HAGGARD, GAUNT.**  
These words signify a wasted appearance. _Haggard_ originally was applied to a hawk "that preyed for herself long before she was taken, " and meant wild. It was applied to a person with special reference to a wild look in the eyes, but its meaning has been distinctly influenced by the resemblance in form to _hag_, so that it came to signify _hag-like._ It differs from _gaunt_, an East Anglian word meaning lean, in referring primarily to the wasted appearance of the face, especially the hollows under the eyes caused by illness or weariness. _Gaunt_ refers both to the whole face and the whole figure. It means thin, angular, bony, with hollows where rounded flesh would naturally be. _Haggard_ is always an abnormal condition caused by illness or some physical or emotional strain. _Gaunt_ may apply under the same conditions, but it may also indicate the usual or normal appearance of an individual.

####hallucination 
**HALLUCINATION, ABERRATION, DELUSION.**  
_Hallucination_, in French the same form, from the Latin _hallucinatio_, that from _hallucinor_, to wander in the mind, signifies, in common language, a perception without a real object to be perceived, an erroneous or insane belief in the reality of things which have no existence. Specifically, the term implies a morbid condition of the mind in which a perception of something occurs where no impression has been made upon the external organs of the special senses, yet where the object is believed to be real and existent.  
In a sense this state is a _delusion,_ but _delusion_ differs from _hallucination_ in that it originates at the other extremity of the chain of consciousness in the mind itself, and consists of erroneous interpretations of real sensations. Thus we recognize in another an aberration, a departure from a customary course, a wandering from fact to fancy; a fallacy in a deceptive or false appearance, in an unsound method of reasoning; a phantasm, a vision of something that does not exist, a spectre that appears visible to the victim only. A victim of _hallucination_ imagines that which is wholly erroneous, non-existent, but believes implicitly that it is real.  
An _aberration_, from Latin _ab_, away, and _errare_, to wander, means a wandering out of the accustomed or normal course, with reference both to thought and to conduct. As applied to the activity of the mind, it differs from _hallucination_ and _delusion_ in emphasizing not the false vision or interpretation, but the abnormal action of the mind itself.

####hapless 
**HAPLESS, ILL-FATED, LUCKLESS. **  
_Hapless_ is a negative of _hap_, a Scandinavian word signifying good luck, whence _happy, happen_, etc., are derived. _Hapless_, accordingly, implies the condition that is contrary to the _hap_ events — hence, misfortune and its attendant vicissitudes.  
We say that a person is _ill-fated_ who seems destined to misfortune. This is the strongest of the above group of terms, for it implies the recognition of a condition in which a person may have been born or one into which he has fallen, and from which apparently he cannot extricate himself — a condition to which he was doomed at birth and in which he remains through life. _Luckless_, on the contrary, implies a condition that may be similar to _ill-fated_, but in the most common usage it suggests not a permanent, but a temporary misfortune, as a venture may be _luckless_ that is without an anticipated advantage; some proceedings out of many may be unfortunate in their results, while the others may turn out according to our desires. 

####happen 
**HAPPEN, CHANCE.**  
To _happen_, that is, to fall out by a _hap_, is to _chance_ as the genus to the species; whatever _chances happens_, but not _vice versa. Happen_ respects all events, without including any collateral idea; _chance_ comprehends likewise the idea of the cause and order of events: whatever comes to pass _happens_, whether regularly in the course of things or particularly and out of the order; whatever _chances happens_, altogether without concert, intention, and often without relation to any other thing. Accidents _happen_ daily which no human foresight could prevent; the newspapers contain an account of all that _happens_ in the course of the day or week: listeners and busybodies are ready to catch every word that _chances_ to fall in their hearing. 

####happiness 
**HAPPINESS, FELICITY, BLESSEDNESS, BEATITUDE, BLISS.**  
_Happiness_ signifies the state of being _happy. Felicity_ comes from Latin _felicitas_, happiness. _Bliss_ is in Anglo-Saxon _bliths_, happiness, literally _blitheness_, from Anglo-Saxon _blithe_, English _blithe._ The original sense of _blessedness_ may have been to consecrate with blood, either by sacrifice or the sprinkling of blood, as the word can be clearly traced back to _blood;_ hence it may have meant to be consecrated, holy; then simply _happiness._ It retains a religious suggestion Still. _Beatitude_, from the Latin _beatus_, signifies the property of being _happy_ in a superior degree.  
_Happiness_ comprehends that aggregate of pleasurable sensations which we derive from external objects. It is the ordinary term which is employed alike in the colloquial or the philosophical style: _felicity_ is a higher expression, comprehending inward enjoyment, or an aggregate of inward pleasure, without regard to the source whence either is derived: _bliss_ is a still higher term, expressing more than either _happiness_ or _felicity_, both as to the degree and nature of the enjoyment. _Happiness_ is the thing adapted to our present condition and to the nature of our being, as a compound of body and soul; it is impure in its nature and variable in degree; it is sought for by various means and with great eagerness; but it often lies much more within our reach than we are apt to imagine: it is not to be found in the possession of great wealth, of great power, of great dominions, of great splendor, or the unbounded indulgences of any one appetite or desire; but in moderate possessions with a heart tempered by religion and virtue for the enjoyment of that which God has bestowed upon us: it is, therefore, not so unequally distributed as some have been led to conclude.  
_Happiness_ admits of degrees, since every individual is placed in different circumstances, either of body or of mind, which fit him to be more or less _happy. Felicity_ is not regarded in the same light; it is that which is positive and independent of all circumstances: domestic _felicity_ and conjugal _felicity_ are regarded as moral enjoyments, abstracted from everything which can serve as an alloy. _Bliss_ is that which is purely spiritual; it has its source in the imagination and rises above the ordinary level of human enjoyments: of earthly _bliss_ little is known but in poetry; of heavenly _bliss_ we form but an imperfect conception from the utmost stretch of our powers. _Blessedness_ is a term of spiritual import, which refers to the _happy_ condition of those who enjoy the Divine favor, and are permitted to have a foretaste of heavenly _bliss_ by the exaltation of their minds above earthly _happiness. Beatitude_ denotes the quality of _happiness_ only which is most exalted, namely, heavenly _happiness._

**HAPPY, FORTUNATE.** — _Happy_ and _fortunate_ are both applied to the external circumstances of a man; but the former conveys the idea of that which is abstractly good, the latter implies rather what is agreeable to one's wishes. A man is _happy_ in his marriage, in his children, in his connections, and the like: he is _fortunate_ in his trading concerns. _Happy_ excludes the idea of chance; _fortunate_ excludes the idea of personal effort: a man is _happy_ in the possession of what he gets; he is _fortunate_ in getting it.  
In another sense, they bear a similar analogy. A _happy_ thought, a _happy_ expression, a _happy_ turn, a _happy_ event, and the like, denote a degree of positive excellence; a _fortunate_ idea, a _fortunate_ circumstance, a _fortunate_ event, are all relatively considered with regard to the wishes and views of the individual.

####harbor 
**HARBOR, HAVEN, PORT.**  
The idea of a resting-place for vessels is common to these terms, of which _harbor_ is general and the two others specific in their significance. _Harbor_ is Scandinavian, from Icelandic _herbergi_, a shelter for an army, compounded of _heri_, army, German _heer_, and _bergen_, to hide; it carries with it little more than the common idea of affording a resting or anchoring place. _Haven_ is also a Scandinavian word possibly allied to Anglo-Saxon _heaf_, sea. _Port_, from the Latin _portus_, a harbor, allied to _porta_, a gate, and to English _ford_, conveys the idea of an enclosure. A _haven_ is a natural _harbor;_ a _port_ is an artificial _harbor._ We characterize a _harbor_ as commodious, a _haven_ as snug and secure; a _port_ as safe and easy of access. A commercial country profits by the excellence and number of its _harbors;_ it values itself on the security of its _havens_, and increases the number of its _ports_ accordingly. A vessel goes into a _harbor_ only for a season; it remains in a _haven_ for a permanency; it seeks a _port_ as the destination of its voyage. Merchantmen are perpetually going in and out of a _harbor;_ a distressed vessel, at a distance from home, seeks some _haven_ in which it may winter; the weary mariner looks to the _port_, not as the termination of his labor, but as the commencement of all his enjoyments.  
**HARBOR, SHELTER, LODGE.** — The idea of giving a resting-place is common to these terms; but _harbor_ (see [foster](entry://foster)) is used mostly in a bad sense, _shelter_ (see [asylum](entry://asylum)) in an indefinite sense:_ lodge_, Old French _loge_, Italian _loggia_, comes from Old High German _loube_, an arbor, from _hub_, a leaf — an arbor being a leafy shelter. _Lobby_ is a doublet of _lodge._ One _harbors_ that which ought not to find room anywhere; one _shelters_ that which cannot find security elsewhere; one _lodges_ that which wants a resting-place. Thieves, traitors, conspirators, are _harbored_ by those who have an interest in securing them from detection: either the wicked or the unfortunate may be _sheltered_ from the evil with which they are threatened: travellers are _lodged_ as occasion may require.  
As the word _harbor_ does not, in its original sense, mean anything more than affording a temporary entertainment, it may be taken in a good sense for an act of hospitality.  
_Harbor_ and _shelter_ are said of things in the sense of giving a harbor or shelter; _lodge_ in the sense of being a resting-place: furniture _harbors_ vermin, trees _shelter_ from the rain, a ball _lodges_ in the breast; so in the moral sense a man _harbors_ resentment, ill-will, evil thoughts, and the like; he _shelters_ himself from a charge by retorting it upon his adversary; or a particular passion may be _lodged_ in the breast or ideas _lodged_ in the mind. 

####hard 
**HARD, FIRM, SOLID.**  
The close adherence of the component parts of a body constitutes _hardness._ The close adherence of different bodies to one another constitutes _firmness_ (see [fixed](entry://fixed)). That is _hard_ which will not yield to a closer compression; that is _firm_ which will not yield so as to produce a separation. Ice is _hard_, as far as it respects itself, when it resists every pressure; it is _firm_, with regard to the water which it covers, when it is so closely bound as to resist every weight without breaking.  
_Hard_ and _solid_ respect the internal constitution of bodies and the adherence of the component parts; but _hard_ denotes a much closer degree of adherence than _solid:_ the _hard_ is opposed to the soft; the _solid_ to the fluid; every _hard_ body is by nature _solid;_ although every _solid_ body is not _hard._ Wood is always a _solid_ body, but it is sometimes _hard_ and sometimes soft; water, when congealed, is a _solid_ body, and admits of different degrees of _hardness._ In another application, _hardness_ is allied to insensibility; _firmness_ to fixedness; _solidity_ to substantiality; a _hard_ man is not to be acted upon by any tender motives; a _firm_ man is not to be turned from his purpose; a _solid_ man holds no purposes that are not well-founded. A man is _hardened_ in that which is bad by being made insensible to that which is good; a man is _confirmed_ in anything good or bad by being rendered less disposed to lay it aside; his mind is _consolidated_ by acquiring fresh motives for action.  
**HARD, CALLOUS, HARDENED, OBDURATE.** — _Hard_ is here, as in the former case, the general term, and the rest particular: _hard_, in its most extensive physical sense, denotes the property of resisting the action of external force, so as not to undergo any change in its form or separation in its parts: _callous_ is that species of the _hard_, in application to the skin, which arises from its dryness and the absence of all nervous susceptibility. _Hard_ and _callous_, from Latin _callosus_, thick-skinned, are likewise applied in the moral sense: but _hard_ denotes the absence of tender feeling, or the property of resisting any impression which tender objects are apt to produce; _callous_ denotes the property of not yielding to the force of motives to action. A _hard_ heart cannot be moved by the sight of misery, let it be presented in ever so affecting a form: a _callous_ mind is not to be touched by any persuasions, however powerful. _Hard_ does not designate any circumstance of its existence or origin: we may be _hard_ from a variety of causes; but _callousness_ arises from the indulgence of vices, passions, and the pursuit of vicious practices. When we speak of a person as _hard_, it simply determines what he is: if we speak of him as _callous_, it refers also to what he was, and from what he is become so.  
_Callous, hardened_, and _obdurate_ are all employed to designate a morally depraved character; but _callousness_ belongs properly to the heart and conscience; _hardened_, to both the heart and the understanding; _obdurate_, more particularly to the will. _Callousness_ is the first stage of _hardness_ in moral depravity; it may exist in the infant mind, on its first tasting the poisonous pleasures of vice, without being acquainted with its remote consequences. A _hardened_ state is the work of time; it arises from a continued course of vice, which becomes, as it were, habitual, and wholly unfits a person for admitting any other impressions; _obduracy_ is the last stage of moral _hardness_, which supposes the whole mind to be obstinately bent on vice. A child discovers himself to be _callous_ when the entreaties, threats, or punishments of a parent cannot awaken in him a single sentiment of contrition; a youth discovers himself to be _hardened_ when he begins to take a pride and a pleasure in a vicious career; a man shows himself to be _obdurate_ when he betrays a settled and confirmed purpose to pursue his abandoned course without regard to consequences.  
**HARD, HARDY, INSENSIBLE, UNFEELING.** — _Hard_ may be applied to either that which makes resistance to external impressions or that which presses with a force upon other objects. _Hardy_, which is only a variation of _hard_, is applicable only in the first case: thus, a person's skin may be _hard_ which is not easily acted upon; but the person is said to be _hardy_ who can withstand the elements: on the other hand, _hard_, when employed as an active principle, is only applied to the moral character; hence the difference between a _hardy_ man who endures everything and a _hard_ man who makes others endure.  
_Insensible_ and _unfeeling_ are but modes of the _hard;_ that is, they designate the negative quality of _hardness_, or its incapacity to receive impression: _hard_, therefore, is always the strongest term of the three; and of the two others _unfeeling_ is stronger than _insensible. Hard_ and _insensible_ are applied physically and morally; _unfeeling_ is employed only as a moral characteristic. A horse's mouth is _hard_ when it is insensible to the action of the bit; a man's heart is _hard_ which is insensible to the miseries of others; a man is _unfeeling_ who does not regard the feelings of others. The heart may be _hard_ by nature, or rendered so by the influence of some passion; but a person is commonly _unfeeling_ from circumstances. Shylock is depicted by Shakespeare as _hard_, from his strong antipathy to the Christians: people who enjoy an uninterrupted state of good health are often _unfeeling_ in eases of sickness. As that which is _hard_ mostly hurts or pains when it comes in contact with the soft, the term _hard_ is peculiarly applicable to superiors or such as have power to inflict pain: a creditor may be _hard_ toward a debtor. As _insensible_ signifies a want of sense, it may be sometimes necessary: a surgeon, when performing an operation, must be _insensible_ to the present pain which he inflicts. As _unfeeling_ signifies a want of feeling, it is always taken for a want of good feeling: where the removal of pain is required, the surgeon shows himself to be _unfeeling_ who does not do everything in his power to lessen the pain of the sufferer.  
**HARD, DIFFICULT, ARDUOUS.** — _Hard_ is here taken in the sense of causing trouble and requiring pains, in which sense it is a much stronger term than _difficult_, which, from the Latin _difficilis_, compounded of the privative _dis_ and _facilis_, signifies merely not easy. _Hard_ is therefore positive, and _difficult_ negative. A _difficult_ task cannot be got through with without exertion, but a _hard_ task requires great exertion. _Difficult_ is applicable to all trivial matters which call for a more than usual portion either of labor or thought; _hard_ is applicable to those which are of the highest importance and accompanied with circumstances that call for the utmost stretch of every power. It is a _difficult_ matter to get admittance into some circles of society that are select: it is _difficult_ to decide between two fine paintings which is the finer; it is a _hard_ matter to come to any conclusion on metaphysical subjects. A child mostly finds it _difficult_ to learn his letters; there are many passages in classical writers which are _hard_ to be understood by the learned.  
_Arduous_, from the Latin _arduus_, lofty, signifying set at a distance or out of reach, expresses more than either _hard_ or _difficult._ What is _difficult_ may be conquered by labor and perseverance without any particular degree of talent; but what is _arduous_ cannot be effected without great mental powers and accomplishments. What is _difficult_ is so in various degrees, according to circumstances; that which is _difficult_ to one person may be less so to another; but that which is _arduous_ is difficult in a high degree, and positively _difficult_ under every circumstance.

**HARD-HEARTED, CRUEL, UNMERCIFUL, MERCILESS**. — _Hard-hearted_ signifies having a hard heart, or a heart not to be moved by the pains of others. _Cruel_, in Latin _crudelis_, allied to _crudus_, raw flesh, and _cruor_, blood, that is, delighting in blood like beasts of prey, signifies ready to inflict pain: as a temper of mind, therefore, _cruel_ expresses much more than _hard-hearted;_ the latter denotes the want of that sensibility toward others which ought to be the property of every human heart; the former, the positive inclination to inflict pain and the pleasure from so doing. _Hard-hearted_ is employed as an epithet of the person; _cruel_, as an epithet to things as well as persons; as a _cruel_ man, a _cruel_ action. _Hard-hearted_ respects solely the moral affections; _cruelty_, in its proper sense, respects the infliction of corporeal pains, but is extended in its application to whatever creates moral pains: a person may be _cruel_, too, in his treatment of children or brutes by beating or starving them; or he may be _cruel_ toward those who look up to him for kindness.  
The _unmerciful_ and _merciless_ are both modes of characteristics of the _hardhearted._ An _unmerciful_ man is _hardhearted_, inasmuch as he is unwilling to extend his compassion or mercy to one who is in his power; a _merciless_ man, which is more than an _unmerciful_ man, is _hard-hearted_, inasmuch as he is restrained by no compunctious feelings from inflicting pain on those who are in his power. Avarice makes a man _hard-hearted_ even to _those_ who are bound to him by the closest ties; it makes him _unmerciful_ to those who are in his debt. There are many _merciless_ tyrants in domestic life, who show their dispositions by their _merciless_ treatment of their poor brutes.  
**HARDLY, SCARCELY.** — What is _hard_ is not common, and in that respect _scarce:_ hence the idea of unfrequency assimilates those terms both in signification and application. In many cases they may be used indifferently; but where the idea of practicability predominates _hardly_ seems most proper; and where the idea of frequency predominates _scarcely_ seems preferable. One can _hardly_ judge of a person's features by a single and partial glance; we _scarcely_ ever see men lay aside their vices from a thorough conviction of their enormity: but it may with equal propriety be said in general sentences, _hardly_ one in a thousand, or _scarcely_ one in a thousand, would form such a conclusion.

####harsh 
**HARSH, ROUGH, SEVERE, RIGOROUS.**  
_Harsh_ (see [acrimony](entry://acrimony)) and _rough_ (see [abrupt](entry://abrupt)) borrow their moral signification from the physical properties of the bodies to which they belong. The _harsh_ and the _rough_ both act painfully upon the taste, but the former with much more violence than the latter. An excess of the sour mingled with other unpleasant properties constitutes _harshness:_ an excess of astringency constitutes _roughness._ Cheese is said to be _harsh_ when it is dry and biting: _roughness_ is the peculiar quality of the damascene. From this physical distinction between these terms we discover the ground of their moral application. _Harshness_ in a person's conduct acts upon the feelings and does violence to the affections: _roughness_ acts only externally on the senses: we may be _rough_ in the tone of the voice, in the mode of address, or in the manner of handling or touching an object; but we are _harsh_ in the sentiment we convey and according to the persons to whom it is conveyed: a stranger may be _rough_ when he has it in his power to be so: only a friend or one in the tenderest relation can be _harsh. Severe_ (see [austere](entry://austere)). _Rigorous_, from the Latin _rigor_ and _rigere_, to stiffen, designates unbending, inflexible. These terms mark different modes of treating those that are in one's power, all of which are the reverse of the kind. _Harsh_ and _rough_ are epithets of that which is unamiable: they indicate the _harshness_ and _roughness_ of the humor: _severity_ and _rigor_ are not always to be condemned; they spring from principle, and are often resorted to by necessity. _Harshness_ is always mingled with anger and personal feeling: _severity_ and _rigor_ characterize things more than the temper of persons. A _harsh_ master renders every burden which he imposes doubly _severe_ by the grating manner in which he communicates his will: a _severe_ master simply imposes the burden in a manner to enforce obedience. The one seems to indulge himself in inflicting pain: the other seems to act from a motive that is independent of the pain inflicted. A _harsh_ man is therefore always _severe_, but with injustice: a _severe_ man, however, is not always _harsh. Rigor_ is a high degree of _severity._ One is _severe_ in the punishment of offences: one is _rigorous_ in exacting compliance and obedience. _Severity_ is always more or less necessary in the army, or in a school, for the preservation of good order: _rigor_ is essential in dealing with the stubborn will and unruly passions of men. 

####harshness 
See [acrimony](entry://acrimony)

####hasten 
**HASTEN, ACCELERATE, SPEED, EXPEDITE, DESPATCH.**  
_Hasten_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _hœst_, Modern English _haste_, meaning originally violence. Old French _haste_ is from the same Teutonic root. _Accelerate_, from _celer_, quick, signifies literally to quicken for a specific purpose. _Speed_, from Anglo-Saxon _spowan_, to succeed, meant originally to increase, to become prosperous — whence the phrase, _speed_ the parting guest. _Expedite_ (see [diligent](entry://diligent)). _Despatch_ comes from Spanish _despachar_, from Latin _dis_, away, and a root found in the past participle _pactus_, from _pangere_, to fix.  
Quickness in movement and action is the common idea of all these terms, which vary in the nature of the movement and the action. To _hasten_ expresses little more than the general idea of quickness in moving toward a point; thus, he _hastens_ who runs to get to the end of his journey: _accelerate_ expresses, moreover, the idea of bringing something to a point; thus, every mechanical business is _accelerated_ by the order and distribution of its several parts. It may be employed, like the word _hasten_, for corporeal and familiar actions: a tailor _accelerates_ any particular work that he has in hand by putting on additional hands; or a compositor _accelerates_ the printing of a work by doing his part with correctness. The word _speed_ includes not only quick, but forward movement. He who goes with _speed_ goes effectually forward, and comes to his journey's end the sooner. This idea is excluded from the term _haste_, which may often be a planless, unsuitable quickness. Hence the proverb, "The more _haste_ the worse _speed. "  
Expedite_ and _despatch_ are terms of higher import, in application to the most serious concerns in life; but to _expedite_ expresses a process, a bringing forward toward an end: _despatch_ implies a putting an end to, a making a clearance. We do everything in our power to _expedite_ a business: we _despatch_ a great deal of business within a given time. _Expedition_ is requisite for one who executes; _despatch_ is most important for one who determines and directs. An inferior officer must proceed with _expedition_ to fulfil the orders or execute the purposes of his commander; a general or minister of state _despatches_ the concerns of planning, directing, and instructing. Hence it is we speak only of _expediting_ a thing; but we may speak of _despatching_ a person as well as a thing.  
**HASTEN, HURRY.** — _Hasten_ (see above). _Hurry_ is a word of imitative origin, indicating the sound of swift movement.  
To _hasten_ and _hurry_ both imply to move forward with quickness in any matter; but the former may proceed with some design and good order, but the latter always supposes perturbation and irregularity. We _hasten_ in the communication of good news when we make efforts to convey it in the shortest time possible; we _hurry_ to get to an end when we impatiently and inconsiderately press forward without making choice of our means. To _hasten_ is opposed to delay, or a dilatory mode of proceeding; it is frequently indispensable to _hasten_ in the affairs of human life: to _hurry_ is opposed to deliberate and cautious proceeding: it must always be prejudicial, and unwise to _hurry;_ men may _hasten;_ children _hurry._ As epithets, _hasty_ and _hurried_ are both employed in another sense; but _hasty_ implies merely an overquickness of motion which outstrips consideration; _hurried_ implies a disorderly motion which springs from a distempered state of mind. Irritable people use _hasty_ expressions; they speak before they think: deranged people walk with _hurried_ steps; they follow the blind impulse of undirected feeling.

####hate 
**HATE, DETEST.**  
The alliance between these terms in signification is sufficiently illustrated in the articles referred to. Their difference consists more in sense than application. To _hate_ (see [antipathy](entry://antipathy)) is a personal feeling directed toward the object independently of its qualities; to _detest_ (see [abhor](entry://abhor)) is a feeling independent of the person, and altogether dependent upon the nature of the thing. What one _hates_ one _hates_ commonly on one's own account; what one _detests_ one _detests_ on account of the object: hence it is that one _hates_, but not _detests_, the person who has done an injury to one's self; and that one _detests_, rather than _hates_, the person who has done injuries to others. Joseph's brethren _hated_ him because he was more beloved than they; we _detest_ a traitor to his country because of the enormity of his offence.  
In this connection to _hate_ is always a bad passion: to _detest_ always laudable; but, when both are applied to inanimate objects, to _hate_ is bad or good, according to circumstances; to _detest_ always retains its good meaning. When men _hate_ things because they interfere with their indulgences, as the wicked _hate_ the light, it is a bad personal feeling, as in the former case, but when good men are said to _hate_ that which is bad it is a laudable feeling, justified by the nature of the object. As this feeling is, however, so closely allied to _detest_, it is necessary further to observe that _hate_, whether rightly or wrongly applied, seeks the injury or destruction of the object: but _detest_ is confined simply to the shunning of the object, or thinking of it with very great pain. God _hates_ sin, and on that account punishes sinners; conscientious men _detest_ all fraud, and therefore cautiously avoid being concerned in it.  
**HATEFUL, ODIOUS.** — _Hateful_ signifies, literally, full of that which is apt to excite _hatred. Odious_, from the Latin _odi_, I hate, has the same sense originally.  
These epithets are employed in regard to such objects as produce strong aversion in the mind; but when employed, as they commonly are, upon familiar subjects, they indicate an unbecoming vehemence in the speaker. _Hateful_ is properly applied to whatever violates general principles of morality; lying and swearing are _hateful_ vices; _odious_ is more commonly applied to such things as affect the interests of others and bring _odium_ upon the individual; a tax that bears particularly hard and unequally is termed _odious_, or a measure of government that is oppressive is denominated _odious.  
Hatred, Enmity, Ill-will, Rancor._ — These terms agree in this particular, that those who are under the influence of such feelings derive a pleasure from the misfortune of others; but _hatred_ (see **aversion** under [averse](entry://averse)) expresses more than _enmity_ (see [enemy](entry://enemy)), and this more than _ill-will_, which signifies either an evil will or a willing of evil. _Hatred_ is not contented with merely wishing _ill_ to others, but derives its whole happiness from their misery or destruction; _enmity_, on the contrary, is limited in its operations to particular circumstances: _hatred_, on the other hand, is frequently confined to the feeling of the individual; but _enmity_ consists as much in the action as in the feeling. He who is possessed with _hatred_ is happy when the object of his passion is miserable, and is miserable when he is happy; but the _hater_ is not always instrumental in causing his misery or destroying his happiness: he who is inflamed with _enmity_ is more active in disturbing the peace of his _enemy_, but oftener displays his temper in trifling, than in important matters. _Ill-will_, as the word denotes, lies only in the mind, and is so indefinite in its signification that it admits of every conceivable degree. When the will is evilly directed toward another in ever so small a degree it constitutes _ill-will. Rancor_ comes from Latin _rancius_, evil smelling. 

####haughtiness 
**HAUGHTINESS, DISDAIN, ARROGANCE.**  
_Haughtiness_ denotes the abstract quality of _haughty_, which comes from Old French _haut_, originally _halt_, from _altus_, high. It meant originally "high and mighty. " _Disdain_ (see [contemn](entry://contemn)). _Arrogance_ (see that word).  
_Haughtiness_ is founded on the high opinion we entertain of ourselves; _disdain_, on the low opinion we have of others; _arrogance_ is the result of both, but, if anything, more of the former than the latter. _Haughtiness_ and _disdain_ are properly sentiments of the mind, and _arrogance_ a mode of acting resulting from a state of mind: there may therefore be _haughtiness_ and _disdain_ which have not betrayed themselves by any visible action; but _arrogance_ is always accompanied with its corresponding action: the _haughty_ man is known by the air of superiority which he assumes; the _disdainful_ man, by the contempt which he shows to others; the _arrogant_ man, by his lofty pretensions. _Haughtiness_ and _arrogance_ are both vicious; they are built upon a false idea of ourselves; but _disdain_ may be justifiable when provoked by what is infamous: a lady must treat with _disdain_ the person who insults her honor.

_Haughty, High, High-minded. — Haughty_ and _high_, derived from the same source as _haughty_, characterize both the external behavior and the internal sentiment; _high-minded_ marks the sentiment only, or the state of the mind. With regard to the outward behavior, _haughty_ is a stronger term than _high;_ a _haughty_ carriage bespeaks not only a _high_ opinion of one's self, but a strong mixture of contempt for others: a _high_ carriage denotes simply a _high_ opinion of one's self: _haughtiness_ is therefore always offensive. as it is burdensome to others; but _height_ may sometimes be laudable, inasmuch as it is justice to one's self: one can never give a command in a _haughty_ tone without making others feel their inferiority in a painful degree; we may sometimes assume a _high_ tone in order to shelter ourselves from insult.  
With regard to the sentiment of the mind, _haughty_, whether it shows itself in the outward behavior or rests in the mind, is always bad; _height_ as an habitual temper, and still more _high-mindedness_, which more strongly marks the personal quality, are expressly inconsistent with Christian humility; but a man may with reason be too _high_ or too _high-minded_ to condescend to a mean action.

####have 
**HAVE, POSSESS.**  
_Have_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _habban_, a widely distributed Teutonic word. _Possess_, in Latin _possessus_, participle of _possideo_, compounded of Latin _pot_, as in _potes_, able, and _sedere_, to sit, means to remain master, to be able to keep.  
_Have_ is the general, _possess_ is the particular term: _have_ designates no circumstance of the action; _possess_ expresses a particular species of having. To _have_ is sometimes to have in one's hand or within one's reach; but to _possess_ is to _have_ as one's own; a clerk _has_ the money which he has fetched for his employer; the latter _possesses_ the money, which he _has_ the power of turning to his use. To _have_ is sometimes to _have_ the right to, to belong; to _possess_ is to _have_ by one and at one's command: a debtor _has_ the property which he has surrendered to his creditor; but he cannot be said to _possess_ it, because he _has_ it not within his reach and at his disposal: we are not necessarily masters of that which we _have;_ although we always are of that which we _possess:_ to _have_ is sometimes only temporary; to possess is mostly permanent: we _have_ money which we are perpetually disposing of: we possess lands which we keep for a permanency: a person _has_ the good graces of those whom he pleases; he _possesses_ the confidence of those who put everything in his power. 

####hazard 
**HAZARD, RISK, VENTURE, JEOPARD.**  
All these terms denote actions performed under an uncertainty of the event: but _hazard_ (see [chance](entry://chance)) bespeaks a want of design and choice on the part of the agent; to _risk_ (see [danger](entry://danger)) implies a choice of alternatives; to _venture_, which is the same as _adventure_ (see [event](entry://event)), signifies a calculation and balance of probabilities: one _hazards_ and _risks_ under the fear of an evil; one _ventures_ with the hope of a good. He who _hazards_ an opinion or an assertion does it from presumptuous feelings and upon slight grounds; chances are rather against him than for him that it may prove erroneous: he who _risks_ a battle does it often from necessity; he chooses the least of two evils; although the event is dubious, yet he fears less from a failure than from inaction: he who _ventures_ on a mercantile speculation does it from a love of gain; he flatters himself with a favorable event, and acquires boldness from the prospect. He who _jeopards_ a cause (from Old French _jeu_, Latin _iocus_, a game, and _partitus_, parted, meaning a divided game, one in which the outcome is dubious) threatens its downfall or disaster. _Jeopard_ means to _hazard_, with a presumption, however, in favor of an unfortunate outcome. There are but very few circumstances to justify us in _hazarding;_ there may be several occasions which render it necessary to _risk_, and very many cases in which it may be advantageous to _venture._

####healthy 
**HEALTHY, WHOLESOME, SALUBRIOUS, SALUTARY.**  
_Healthy_ signifies not only having _health_, but also causing _health. Wholesome_, like the German _heilsam_, signifies making whole, keeping whole or sound. _Salubrious_ and _salutary_, from the Latin _salus_, safety or _health_, signify likewise contributive to _health_ or good in general.  
These epithets are all applicable to such objects as have a kindly influence on the bodily constitution: _healthy_ is the most general and indefinite; it is applied to exercise, to air, situation, climate, and most other things but food, for which _wholesome_ is commonly substituted: the life of a farmer is reckoned the most _healthy;_ and the simplest diet is the most _wholesome. Healthy_ and _wholesome_ are rather negative in their sense; _salubrious_ and _salutary_ are positive, that is, _healthy_ and _wholesome_ which does no injury to the _health;_ that is _salubrious_ which serves to improve the _health;_ and that is _salutary_ which serves to remove a disorder: climates are _healthy_ or _unhealthy_, according to the constitution of the person; water is a _wholesome_ beverage for those who are not dropsical; bread is a _wholesome_ diet for man; the air and climate of southern France have been long famed for their _salubrity_, and have induced many invalids to repair thither for the benefit of their _health;_ the effects have not been equally _salutary_ in all cases  
_Wholesome_ and _salutary_ have likewise an extended and moral application; _healthy_ and _salubrious_ are employed only in the proper sense: _wholesome_ in this case seems to convey the idea of making whole again what has been unsound; but _salutary_ retains the idea of improving the condition of those who stand in need of improvement: correction is _wholesome_ which serves the purpose of amendment without doing any injury to the body; instruction or admonition is _salutary_ when it serves the purpose of strengthening good principles and awakening a sense of guilt or impropriety: laws and punishments are _wholesome_ to the body politic, as diet is to the physical body; restrictions are _salutary_ in checking irregularities.

####heap 
**HEAP, PILE, ACCUMULATE, AMASS.**  
To _heap_ signifies to form into a _heap_, from Anglo-Saxon _heap_, a crowd, a pile. To _pile_ is to form into a _pile_, from Latin _pila_, originally a pillar, a pier of stone. To _accumulate_, from the Latin _cumulus_, a _heap_, signifies to put _heap_ upon _heap. Amass_ comes from French _à masse_, Latin _ad massa_, literally in a mass, meaning to gather to one's self in a mass.  
To _heap_ is an indefinite action; it may be performed with or without order: to _pile_ is a definite action done with design and order; thus we _heap_ stones, or _pile_ wood: to _heap_ may be to make into large or small _heaps:_ to _pile_ is always to make something considerable in height: children may _heap_ sticks together; men _pile_ loads of wood together.  
To _pile_ is used always, to _heap_ mostly, in the physical, _accumulate_ and amass in the physical or moral acceptation. To _accumulate_ is properly to bring or add _heap_ to _heap_, which is a gradual and unfinished act; to _amass_ is to form into a mass, which is a single complete act; a man may _accumulate_ guineas or anything else in small quantities, but he properly amasses wealth, and in a figurative sense he _amasses_ knowledge. To _accumulate_ and to _amass_ are not always the acts of conscious agents: things may _accumulate_ or _amass;_ water or snow _accumulates_ by the continual accession of fresh quantities; ice _amasses_ in rivers until they are frozen over: so in the moral acceptation, evils, abuses, and the like, _accumulate:_ corruption _amasses._

####hear 
**HEAR, HEARKEN, OVERHEAR.**  
To _hear_ is properly the act of the ear; it is sometimes totally abstracted from the mind, when we _hear_ and do not understand: to _hearken_ is an act of the ear and the mind in conjunction; it implies an effort to _hear_, a tendency of the ear: to _overhear_ is to _hear_ clandestinely, or unknown to the person who is heard, whether designedly or not. We _hear_ sounds: we _hearken_ for the sense; we _overhear_ the words: a quick ear _hears_ the smallest sound; a willing mind _hearkens_ to what is said; a prying curiosity leads to _overhearing._

####hearten 
**HEARTEN, ANIMATE, CHEER, COMFORT, ENCOURAGE.**  
_Hearten_ is a compound of the English _heart_ and the suffix _en. Heart_, in Anglo-Saxon _heorte_, allied to Latin COP, implies the vital, inner, or chief part of anything, in persons the seat of the faculties. To _hearten_ another is to bestow upon him an influence directly from the heart; figuratively a spoken word or a voluntary act, when the person is disheartened, that is, timely, sincere, and thoroughly meant.  
To _animate_ either a person, animal, or drooping plant is to impart new life to the subject by an infusion that goes directly to the heart; to inspire a person with energy, courage, ardor, to stimulate: to _cheer_, to comfort, console, invigorate, brace up, produce a joyous, hopeful state of mind: to _comfort_, to give consolation in time of affliction, sickness, or trouble, support, assistance, relief in time of misfortune or danger: and to _encourage_, to incite to renewed effort, to urge forward, to give confidence to another, also to promote, help forward, advance.  
While there is an apparent similarity in the import of all these terms, there are variant shades of meaning connected with each, which are critically considered in the articles on ANIMATE, CHEER, and ENCOURAGE. 

####heartiness 
See [zeal](entry://zeal)

####heartless 
**HEARTLESS, BRUTAL, PITILESS, CRUEL, UNFEELING,**  
_Heartless_ (for derivation see [hearten](entry://hearten)) means literally without heart, and is applied to a variety of conditions that exhibit the worst features of human life, with nothing in extenuation. Of the terms here mentioned _brutal_ and _pitiless_ are the severest. _Brutal_ is associated with the actions of a savage, an irresponsible, conscienceless creature, scarcely a whit better than a wild animal, whose attacks are liable to occur at any moment and to be repeated indefinitely, if death does not ensue from the first.  
A person who is naturally _brutal_ or who becomes so by evil influences is capable of deeds of violence and inhumanity with and without provocation. The _cruel_ person may in his conduct reach the state of _brutality_, for he is disposed to injure or take pleasure in the injury of others, but his acts are generally studied ones, thought out in advance, showing a disposition or a growing gratification to injure others, while the _brutal_ one is more apt to act on a momentary impulse.  
_Pitiless_, however, implies a combination of whatever is _brutal_ and _cruel_, for those whom these terms designate are destitute of compassion, are merciless, insistent in inflicting injury upon others, deaf to appeals for consideration, pity, and even life itself, unmoved by any sentiment or sympathy, and absolutely _unfeeling_ toward their victims.  
A further discussion of the general conditions which the above terms imply will be found in the article on CRUEL. 

####hearty 
**HEARTY, WARM, SINCERE, CORDIAL.**  
_Hearty, i.e._, having the heart in a thing, and _warm_ (see [fire](entry://fire)) express, a stronger feeling than _sincere_ (see [candid](entry://candid)); _cordial_, from _cor_, the heart, _i.e._, according to the heart, is a mixture of the _warm_ and _sincere._ There are cases in which it may be peculiarly proper to be _hearty_, as when we are supporting the cause of religion and virtue; there are other cases in which it is peculiarly proper to be _warm_, as when our affections ought to be roused in favor of our friends; in all cases we ought to be _sincere_ when we express either a sentiment or a feeling; it is peculiarly happy to be on terms of _cordial_ regard with those who stand in any close relation to us. The man himself should be _hearty;_ his heart should be _warm;_ professions should be _sincere;_ a reception _cordial._

####heave 
**HEAVE, SWELL.**  
_Heave_ is used either transitively or intransitively, as a reflective or a neuter verb; _swell_ is used only as a neuter verb. _Heave_ implies raising, and _swell_ implies distension: they differ, therefore, very widely in sense, but they sometimes agree in application. The bosom is said both to _heave_ and to _swell_, because it happens that the bosom _swells_ by _heaving;_ the waves are likewise said to _heave_ themselves or to _swell_, in which there is a similar correspondence between the actions: otherwise most things which _heave_ do not _swell_, and those which _swell_ do not _heave._

####heavy 
**HEAVY, DULL, DROWSY.**  
_Heavy_ is allied to both _dull_ and _drowsy_, but the latter have no close connection with each other.  
_Heavy_ and _dull_ are employed as epithets both for persons and for things; _heavy_ characterizes the corporeal state of a person; _dull_ qualifies the spirits or the understanding of the subject. A person has a _heavy_ look whose temperament seems composed of gross and weighty materials which weigh him down and impede his movements; he has a _dull_ countenance in whom the ordinary brightness and vivacity of the mind is wanting.  
_Heavy_ and _drowsy_ are both employed in the sense of sleepy; but the former is only a particular state, the latter particular or general; all persons may be occasionally _heavy_ or _drowsy;_ some are habitually _drowsy_ from disease: they likewise differ in degree, the latter being much the greater of the two; and occasionally they are applied to such things as produce sleepiness.  
**HEAVY, BURDENSOME, WEIGHTY, PONDEROUS.** — _Heavy_, from _heave_, signifies the causing to heave, or requiring to be lifted up with force; _burdensome_ signifies having a _burden; weighty_, having a _weight;_ and _ponderous_, from the Latin _pondus_, a weight, has the same original meaning.  
_Heavy_ is the natural property of some bodies; _burdensome_ is incidental to some. In the vulgar sense things are termed _heavy_ which are found difficult to lift, in distinction from those which are light or easy to be lifted; but those things are _burdensome_ which are too troublesome to be carried or borne: many things, therefore, are actually _heavy_ that are never _burdensome;_ and others are occasionally _burdensome_ that are never _heavy:_ that which is _heavy_ is so whether lifted or not; but that which is _burdensome_ must be _burdensome_ to some one carrying it: hard substances are mostly _heavy;_ but to a weak person the softest substance may sometimes be _burdensome_ if he is obliged to bear it; things are _heavy_ according to the difficulty with which they are lifted; but they are _weighty_ according as they _weigh_ other things down. The _heavy_ is therefore indefinite; but the _weighty_ is definite and something positively great: what is _heavy_ to one may be light to another; but that which is _weighty_ exceeds the ordinary weight of other things: _ponderous_ expresses even more than _weighty_, for it includes also the idea of bulk; the _ponderous_, therefore, is that which is so _weighty_ and large that it cannot easily be moved. 

####hector 
**HECTOR, BULLY.**  
These words have a similar meaning. Hector comes from Greek _"Έκτωρ_, the celebrated hero of Troy and a mighty warrior. To _hector_ was to treat others as Hector treated his foes in battle. _Hector_ now differs from _bully_ in suggesting a repeated exercise of argument and force — something irritating and harassing, and less definitely indicating the display of superior brute force. _Bully_ comes from Old Low German. The oldest sense in English is "dear one, " a lover. It now signifies a person who gets his own will by a display of force, especially against those whom he knows to be much weaker than himself; it carries the suggestion of a perfectly safe threat of force. The _bully_ generally knows that he will not be called upon to live up to his fierce protestations; that the mere display will make his victim yield. _Hector_ does not suggest this element in the verb to _bully._ One may _hector_ one's equal or superior; one _bullies_ one's inferiors. 

####heed 
**HEED, CARE, ATTENTION.**  
_Heed_ (see [attend](entry://attend)) applies to matters of importance to one's moral conduct; _care_ (see [care](entry://care)) to matters of minor import: a man is required to take _heed;_ a child is required to take _care:_ the former exercises his understanding in taking _heed;_ the latter exercises his thoughts and his senses in taking _care:_ the former looks to the remote and probable consequences of his actions, and endeavors to prevent the evil that may happen; the latter sees principally to the thing that is immediately before him. When a young man enters the world he must take _heed_ lest he be not ensnared by his companions into vicious practices; in a slippery path we must take _care_ that we do not fall.  
_Heed_ has, moreover, the sense of thinking on what is proposed to our notice, in which it agrees with _attention_ (see [attend](entry://attend)); hence we speak of giving _heed_ and paying _attention:_ but the former is applied only to that which is conveyed to us by another, in the shape of a direction, a caution, or an instruction; but the latter is said of everything which we are said to perform. A good child gives _heed_ to his parents when they caution him against any dangerous or false step; he pays _attention_ to the lesson which is set him to learn. He who gives no _heed_ to the counsels of others is made to repent his _folly by_ bitter experience; he who fails in paying _attention_ cannot learn. 

####heedless 
See **negligent** under [neglect](entry://neglect)

####heighten 
**HEIGHTEN, RAISE, AGGRAVATE.**  
To _heighten_ is to make _higher_ (see **haughty** under [haughtiness](entry://haughtiness)). TO _raise_ is to cause to _rise_ (see [arise](entry://arise)). TO _aggravate_ (see that word) is to make _heavy. Heighten_ refers more to the result of the action of making _higher; raise_ to the mode; we _heighten_ a house by _raising_ the roof, where _raising_ conveys the idea of setting up aloft, which is not included in the word _heighten._ On the same ground a head-dress may be said to be _heightened_ which is made _higher_ than it was before; and a chair or a table is _raised_ that is set upon something else: but in speaking of a wall we may say that it is either _heightened_ or _raised_, because the operation and result must in both cases be the same. In the improper sense of these terms they preserve a similar distinction: we _heighten_ the value of a thing; we _raise_ its price: we _heighten_ the grandeur of an object; we _raise_ a family.  
_Heighten_ and _aggravate_ have connection with each other only in application to offences: the enormity of an offence is _heightened_, the guilt of the offender is _aggravated_, by particular circumstances. The horrors of a murder are _heightened_ by being committed in the dead of the night: the guilt of the perpetrator is _aggravated_ by the addition of ingratitude to murder. 

####heinous 
**HEINOUS, FLAGRANT, FLAGITIOUS, ATROCIOUS.**  
_Heinous_ comes from Old French _haïnos_, from _haïr_, to hate, from the Teutonic root also found in English _hate. Flagrant_, in Latin _flagrans_, burning, is a figurative expression denoting excessive and violent in its nature. _Flagitious_, in Latin _flagitiosus_, from _flagitium_, signifies peculiarly infamous. _Atrocious_, in Latin _atrox_, cruel, signifies exceedingly black in guilt.  
These epithets, which are applied to crimes, seem to rise in degree. A crime is _heinous_ which seriously offends against the laws of men; a sin is _heinous_ which seriously offends against the will of God; an offence  
I is _flagrant_ which is in direct defiance of established opinions and practice: it is _flagitious_ if a gross violation of the moral law or coupled with any grossness; a crime is _atrocious_ which is attended with any aggravating circumstances. Lying is a _heinous sin;_ gaming and drunkenness are _flagrant_ breaches of the Divine law; the murder of a whole family is in the fullest sense _atrocious._

####help 
**HELP, ASSIST, AID, SUCCOR, RELIEVE.**  
_Help_ is in Anglo-Saxon _helpan_, German _helfen. Assist_, in Latin _assisto_, or _ad_ and _sisto_, signifies to place one's self by another so as to give him our strength. _Aid_, in Latin _adjutare_, a frequentative of _ad_ and _juvare_, to help, signifies to profit toward a specific end. _Succor_, in Latin _succurrere_, to run to the help of any one. _Relieve_ (see [alleviate](entry://alleviate)).  
The idea of communicating to the advantage of another in case of need is common to all these terms. _Help_ is the generic term; the rest specific: _help_ may be substituted for the others, and in many cases where they would not be applicable. The first three are employed either to produce a positive good or to remove an evil; the latter two only, remove an evil. We _help_ a person to prosecute his work, or _help_ him out of a difficulty; we _assist_ in order to forward a scheme, or we _assist_ a person in the time of his embarrassment; we _aid_ a good cause, or we _aid_ a person to make his escape; we _succor_ a person who is in danger; we _relieve_ him in time of distress. To _help_ and _assist_ respect personal service, the former by corporeal, the latter by corporeal or mental labor: one servant _helps_ another by taking a part in his employment; one author _assists_ another in the composition of his work. We _help_ up a person's load; we _assist_ him to rise when he has fallen; we _speak_ of a _helper_ or a _helpmate_ in mechanical employments, of an _assistant_ to a professional man.  
To _assist_ and _aid_ are used for services directly or indirectly performed: but the former is said only of individuals; the latter may be said of bodies as well as individuals. One friend _assists_ another with his purse, with his counsel, his interest, and the like: one person _aids_ another in carrying on a scheme; or one king, or nation, _aids_ another with armies and subsidies. We come to the _assistance_ of a person when he has met with an accident; we come to his _aid_ when contending against numbers. _Assistance_ is given, _aid_ is sent.  
To _succor_ is a species of immediate _assistance_, which is given on the spur of the occasion; the Good Samaritan went to the _succor_ of the man who had fallen among thieves; so in like manner we may _succor_ one who calls us by his cries; or we may _succor_ the poor whom we find in circumstances of distress. So likewise one may _succor_ a nation.  
The word _relieve_ has nothing in common with _succor_, except that they both express the removal of pain; but the latter does not necessarily imply any mode by which this is done, and therefore excludes the idea of personal interference. To _help_ is commonly an act of good-nature or discretion; to _relieve_, an act of humanity or generosity.  
All these terms, except _succor_, may be applied to things as well as persons; we may walk by the _help_ of a stick, read with the _assistance_ of glasses, learn a task quickly by the _aid_ of a good memory, and obtain _relief_ from medicine.

####herculean 
**HERCULEAN, BRAWNY, POWERFUL, STRONG, VIGOROUS.**  
_Herculean_, an adjective derived from Hercules (in Greek _Ηρακλής_, the hero of Grecian mythology who was said to be possessed of superhuman strength, implies, both as to persons and objects, the quality of extraordinary strength. Applied to persons, _brawny_ designates a tough, muscular condition, and relates particularly to the arms, calves of the legs, the breast, back, and such other parts as are employed in strenuous actions. _Powerful_, in this sense means might, force, both in an unusually high development; _strong_, having the power or ability to exert great bodily force, the mental or physical capability to bear or endure great burdens, sorrow, suffering; and _vigorous,_ the condition resulting from sound health, the possession of mental or physical energy, derived from the Latin _vigere_, to be lively.  
**HERCULEAN, DIFFICULT, HARD, PERILOUS, TOILSOME.** — This application of the term implies actions that require the power, strength, or courage of Hercules to perform or encounter that which is exceedingly great in magnitude and difficult or dangerous in the performance. _Difficult_ implies that which is arduous, not easily managed or comprehended, more or less perplexing, that which requires much labor and skill to overcome or accomplish; _hard_, that which is compact and solid, not easily pierced or broken, unyielding, and, hence, necessitating continuous application and labor and involving mental or physical fatigue; _perilous_, that which is beset with danger to the performer, which exposes him to injury or hazard, to the extent of his life; and _toilsome_, that which requires much time, labor, and ingenuity, the exertion of bodily strength, with efforts of some continuance or duration, producing weariness, exhaustion, fatigue, and other results of over-labor. 

####heresy 
See [heterodoxy](entry://heterodoxy)

####heretic 
**HERETIC, SCHISMATIC, SECTARIAN or SECTARY, DISSENTER, NON-CONFORMIST.**  
A _heretic_ is the maintainer of _heresy_ (see [heterodoxy](entry://heterodoxy)); the _schismatic_ is the author or promoter of _schism;_ the _sectarian_ or _sectary_ is the member of a _sect;_ the _dissenter_ is one who _dissents_ from an established religion; and the _non-conformist_ one who does not _conform_ to an establishment. A man is a _heretic_ only for matters of faith and doctrine, but he is a _schismatic_ in matters of discipline and practice. The _heretic_, therefore, is not always a _schismatic_, nor the _schismatic_ a _heretic._ Whoever holds the doctrines that are common to the Roman Catholic and reformed churches is not a _heretic_ in the Protestant sense of the word, although he may in many outward formalities be a _schismatic._ Calviniste are not _heretics_, but many among them are _schismatics;_ on the other hand, there are many members of the establishment who hold, though they do not avow, _heretical_ notions.  
The _heretic_ is considered as such with regard to the Catholic Church or the whole body of Christians, holding the same fundamental principles; but the _schismatic_ and _sectarian_ are considered as such with regard to particular bodies of Christians. _Schism_, from the Greek _σχίζειν_, to split, denotes an action, and the _schismatic_ is an agent who splits for himself in his own individual capacity: the _sectarian_ does not expressly perform a part, he merely holds a relation; he does not divide anything himself, but belongs to that which is already cut or divided. The _schismatic_, therefore, takes upon himself the whole moral responsibility of the _schism;_ but the _sectarian_ does not necessarily take an active part in the measures of his _sect;_ whatever guilt attaches to _schism_ attaches to the _schismatic;_ he is a voluntary agent, acting from an erroneous principle, if not an unchristian temper: the _sectarian_ is often an involuntary agent; he follows that to which he has been incidentally attached. It is possible, therefore, to be a _schismatic_ and not a _sectarian;_ as also to be a _sectarian_ and not a _schismatic._ Those professed members of the establishment who affect the title of evangelical and wish to palm upon the Church the peculiarities of the Calvinistic doctrine, and to ingraft their own modes and forms into its discipline, are _schismatics_, but not _sectarians;_ on the other hand, those who by birth and education are attached to a _sect_ are _sectarians_, but not always _schismatics._ Consequently, _schismatic_ is a term of much greater reproach than _sectarian._  
The _schismatic_ and _sectarian_ have a reference to any established body of Christians of any country; but _dissenter_ is a term applicable only to the inhabitants of Great Britain, and bearing relation only to the established Church of England: it includes not only those who have individually and personally renounced the doctrines of the Church, but those who are in a state of _dissent_ or difference from it. _Dissenters_ are not necessarily either _schismatics_ or _sectarians_, for British Roman Catholics are all _dissenters_, although they are the reverse of what is understood by _schismatic_ and _sectarian:_ it is equally clear that all _schismatics_ and _sectarians_ are not _dissenters_, because every established community of Christians, all over the world, have had individuals, or smaller bodies of individuals, setting themselves up against them: the term _dissenter_ being in a great measure technical, it may be applied individually or generally without conveying any idea of reproach; the same may be said of _nonconformist_, which is a more special term, including only such as do not _conform_ to some established or national religion: consequently, all members of the Romish Church, or of the Kirk of Scotland, are excluded from the number of _non-conformists;_ while on the other hand, all British-born subjects not adhering to these two forms, and at the same time renouncing the established form of their country, are of this number, among whom may be reckoned Independents, Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers, Methodists, and all other such _sects_ as have been formed since the Reformation. 

####hesitate 
**HESITATE, FALTER, STAMMER, STUTTER.**  
_Hesitate_ (see [demur](entry://demur)). _Falter_ or _faulter_ seems to signify to commit a _fault_ or blunder. _Stammer_ comes from a root found in _stand;_ it meant to stand fixed, amazed, and is related to German _stumm_, dumb. It now signifies the confusion and hesitation of speech incident to extreme amazement. _Stutter_ is a frequentative of _stut_, once common in the sense of _stutter._ "I _stutte;_ I can not speake my wordes redyly, " writes Palgrave. The original root of _stutter_ meant to strike against, hence to trip in the speech.  
A defect in utterance is the idea which is common in the signification of all these terms: they differ either as to the cause or the mode of the action. With regard to the cause, a _hesitation_ results from the state of the mind and an interruption in the train of thoughts; _falter_ arises from a perturbed state of feeling; _stammer_ and _stutter_ arise either from an incidental circumstance or more commonly from a physical defect in the organs of utterance. A person who is not in the habit of public speaking, or of collecting his thoughts into a set form, will be apt to _hesitate_ even in familiar conversation; he who first addresses a public assembly will be apt to _falter._ Children who first begin to read will _stammer_ at hard words: and one who has an impediment in his speech will _stutter_ when he attempts to speak in a hurry.  
With regard to the mode or degree of the action, _hesitate_ expresses less than _falter; stammer_ less than _stutter._ The slightest difficulty in uttering words constitutes a _hesitation;_ a pause or the repetition of a word may be termed _hesitating:_ but to _falter_ supposes a failure in the voice as well as the lips when they refuse to do their office. _Stammering_ and _stuttering_ are confined principally to the useless moving of the mouth; he who _stammers_ brings forth sounds, but not the right sounds, without trials and efforts; he who _stutters_ remains for some time in a state of agitation without uttering a sound.

####heterodoxy 
**HETERODOXY, HERESY.**  
_Heterodoxy_, from the Greek _έτερος_ and _δόξα_, signifies another or a different doctrine. _Heresy_, through French and Latin from the Greek _αίρεσις_, a choice, signifies an opinion adopted by individual choice.  
To be of a different persuasion is _heterodoxy;_ to have a faith of one's own is _heresy_, the _heterodoxy_ characterizes the opinions formed; the _heresy_ characterizes the individual forming the opinion: the _heterodoxy_ exists independently and for itself; the _heresy_ sets itself up against others. As all division supposes error either on one side or on both, the words _heterodoxy_ and _heresy_ are applied only to human opinions, and strictly in the sense of a false opinion, formed in distinction from that which is better founded; but the former implies any opinions, important or otherwise; the latter refers only to matters of importance: the heresy is therefore a fundamental schism. There has been much _heterodoxy_ in the Christian world at all times, and among these have been _heresies_ denying the most serious doctrines which have been acknowledged by the great body of Christians since the Apostles. 

####heterogeneous 
**HETEROGENEOUS**, from Greek _έτερος_, other, and _γέγος_, kind, meant literally of a different kind. It signifies that which is made up of different kinds of I elements, and is opposed to _homogeneous._ It has no real synonymes except the more general words listed under **different** under [differ](entry://differ), which see.

####hideous 
**HIDEOUS, GHASTLY, GRIM, GRISLY.**  
_Hideous_ comes from Old French _hidos_, which is probably derived from Latin _hispidosus_, rough, shaggy. _Ghastly_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _gœstan_, to terrify, allied to _aghast. Grim_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _grim_, fierce. _Grisly_, Anglo-Saxon _grislic_, is formed with the suffix _lic_ from _grisan_, to shudder.  
An unseemly exterior is characterized by these terms; but the _hideous_ refers to natural objects, and the _ghastly_ more properly that which is supernatural, or what resembles it. A mask with monstrous grinning features looks _hideous;_ a human form with a visage of death-like paleness is _ghastly._ The _grim_ is applicable only to the countenance; dogs or wild beasts may look very _grim: grisly_ refers to the whole form, but particularly to the color; as blackness or darkness has always something terrifying in it, a _grisly_ figure having a monstrous assemblage of dark color is particularly calculated to strike terror. _Hideous_ is applicable to objects of hearing also, as a _hideous_ roar; but the rest to objects of sight only. 

####high 
**HIGH, TALL, LOFTY.**  
_High_ is allied to German _hoch. Tall_ comes from Middle English _tal_, seemly, obedient, valiant, which was a general word of approval. _Lofty_ comes from Scandinavian _loft_, an upper room, allied to Anglo-Saxon _lyft_, air, sky, meaning high in the air.  
_High_ is the term in most general use, which seems likewise in the most unqualified manner to express the idea of extension upward, which is common to them all. Whatever is _tall_ and _lofty_ is _high_, but everything is not _tall_ or _lofty_ which is _high. Tall_ and _lofty_ both designate a more than ordinary degree of _height;_ but _tall_ is peculiarly applicable to what shoots up or stands up in a perpendicular direction, while _lofty_ is said of that which is extended in breadth as well as in _height_, that which is lifted up or raised by an accretion of matter or an expansion in the air. By this rule we say that a house is _high_, a chimney _tall_, a room _lofty._ With the _high_ is associated no idea of what is striking; but the _tall_ is coupled with the aspiring, or that which strives to outtop: the _lofty_ is always coupled with the grand and that which commands admiration.  
_High_ and _lofty_ have a moral acceptation, but _tall_ is taken in the natural sense only: _high_ and _lofty_ are applied to persons or what is personal, with the same difference in degree as before: a _lofty_ title or _lofty_ pretension conveys more than a _high_ title or a _high_ pretension. Men of _high_ rank should have _high_ ideas of virtue and personal dignity, and keep themselves clear from everything low and mean: a _lofty_ ambition often soars too _high_ to serve the purpose of its possessor, whose fall is the greater when he finds himself compelled to descend.

####high-flown 
**HIGH-FLOWN, BOMBASTIC, SWOLLEN.**  
_High-flown_ is a compound of the English _high_ and _flown; high_, in Anglo-Saxon _heah_, implies that which is elevated; _flown_, from _fly_, in Anglo-Saxon _fleógan_, implies to move or pass through the air. _High-flown_, in most common usage, is applied to the various terms of language as employed in speech and writing that are extravagant, inflated, above the customary quality, in a pretentious flowery or affected style.  
_Bombastic_ is from _bombast_, originally a soft, loose stuff used to swell out garments, and is applied to high-sounding words, big and puffing, without much meaning or relation to a subject under discussion.  
_Swollen_ and _bombastic_ are terms more closely allied, each implying language that is puffed up; hence used to make one appear consequential, as possessing greater intelligence than others.  
_Swollen_ is a general word which may under certain conditions have the meaning of _bombastic_ or _high-flown. Bombastic_ and _high-flown_, on the other hand, are specific words applied to language and manner.

####hinder 
**HINDER, PREVENT, IMPEDE, OBSTRUCT.**  
_Hinder_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _hindrian_, to keep back or behind. _Prevent_, from _prœ_ and _venire_, to come before, signifies to _hinder_ by coming before, or to cross another by the anticipation of his purpose. _Impede_, from _in_ and _pedes_, signifies to come between a person's feet and entangle him in his progress. _Obstruct_, from _ob_, in the way of, and _struere_, to heap together, signifies to set up something in his way, to block the passage.  
_Hinder_ is the most general of these terms, as it conveys little more than the idea which is common to them all, namely, that of keeping one from his purpose. To _hinder_ is commonly said of that which is rendered impracticable only for the time being, or merely delayed; _prevent_ is said of that which is rendered altogether impracticable. A person is _hindered_ by the weather and his various engagements from reaching a place at the time he intended; he is _prevented_ but not _hindered_ by ill health from going there at all. If a friend calls, he _hinders_ me from finishing the letter which I was writing; if I wish to _prevent_ my son from reading any book I keep it out of his way. To _hinder_ is an act of the moment, it supposes no design; _prevent_ is a premeditated act, deliberated upon, and adopted for general purposes: the former is applied only to the movements of any particular individual, the latter to events and circumstances. I _hinder_ a person who is running, if I lay hold of his arm and make him walk: it is the object of every good government to _prevent_ offences rather than to punish offenders. In ordinary discourse these words come very close in sense when the circumstances of the case do not sufficiently define whether the action in hand be altogether suspended or suspended only for a time, but the above explanation must make it very clear that to _hinder_, in its proper sense and application, is but to stop in the progress, and _prevent_ to stop at the outset. To _impede_ and _obstruct_ are a species of _hindering_ which is said rather of things than of persons: _hinder_ is said of both; but _hinder_ is commonly employed in regard to trifling matters, or such as retard a person's proceedings in the smallest degree; _impede_ and _obstruct_ are acts of greater importance, or produce a still greater degree of delay. A person is _hindered_ in his work, although neither _impeded_ nor _obstructed;_ but the quantity of artillery and baggage which is attached to an army will greatly _impede_ it in its march; and the trees which are thrown across the roads will _obstruct_ its march. _Hindrances_ always suppose the agency of a person, either of the one who _hinders_ or the one who is _hindered:_ but _impediments_ and _obstructions_ may be employed with regard to the operations of nature on inanimate objects. Cold _impedes_ the growth of plants; a dam _obstructs_ the course of water.

**HINDER, STOP.** — _Hinder_ refers solely to the prosecution of an object: _stop_, signifying to make to stand, refers simply to the cessation of motion; we may be _hindered_, therefore, by being _stopped;_ but we may also be _hindered_ without being expressly _stopped_, and we may be _stopped_ without being _hindered._ If the _stoppage_ does not interfere with any other object in view, it is a _stoppage_, but not a _hindrance;_ as when we are _stopped_ by a friend while walking for pleasure: but if _stopped_ by an idler in the midst of urgent business, so as not to be able to proceed according to our business, this is both a _stoppage_ and a _hindrance:_ on the other hand, if we are interrupted in the regular course of our proceeding, but not compelled to stand still or give up our business for any time, this may be a _hindrance_, but not a _stoppage:_ in this manner, the conversation of others in the midst of our business may considerably retard its progress, and so far _hinder_, but not expressly put a _stop to_, the whole concern. 

####hint 
**HINT, SUGGEST, INTIMATE, INSINUATE.**  
_Hint_ and _suggest_ (see [allude](entry://allude)). To _intimate_ is to make one _intimate_, or specially acquainted with, to communicate one's most inward thoughts.  
_Insinuate_, from the Latin _sinus_, a bend, is to introduce by a winding course into the mind of another.  
All these terms denote indirect expressions of what passes in one's own mind. We _hint_ at a thing from fear and uncertainty; we _suggest_ a thing from prudence and modesty; we _intimate_ a thing from indecision; a thing is _insinuated_ from artifice. A person who wants to get at the certain knowledge of any circumstance _hints_ at it frequently in the presence of those who can give him the information; a man who will not offend others by an assumption of superior wisdom _suggests his_ ideas on a subject, instead of setting them forth with confidence; when a person's mind is not made up on any future action, he only _intimates_ what may be done; he who has anything _offensive_ to communicate to another will choose to _insinuate_ it rather than declare it in express terms. _Hints_ are thrown out; they are frequently characterized as broken: _suggestions_ are offered; they are frequently termed idle or ill-grounded: _intimations_ are given, and are either slight or broad: _insinuations_ are thrown out, they are commonly designated as slanderous, malignant, and the like.  
To _hint_ is taken either in a bad or an indifferent sense; it is commonly resorted to by tale-bearers, mischief-makers; and all who want to talk of more than they know. To _suggest_ is oftener used in the good than the bad sense: as to _suggest_ doubts, queries, difficulties, or improvements in matters of opinion is truly laudable, particularly for young persons; but to _suggest_ anything to the disadvantage of another is even worse than to speak ill of him openly, for it bespeaks cowardice as well as ill-nature. To _intimate_ is taken either in a good or an indifferent sense; it commonly passes between relatives or persons closely connected in the communication of their half-formed intentions or of doubtful intelligence; but to _insinuate_ is always taken in a bad sense; it is the resource of an artful and malignant enemy to wound the reputation of another, whom he does not dare openly to accuse. A person is said to take a _hint_, to follow a _suggestion_, to receive an _intimation_, to disregard an _insinuation._

**HIRELING, MERCENARY.**  
_Hireling_, from _hire_, and _mercenary_, from _mercenarius_, based on _merx_, pay, are applied to any one who follows a sordid employment; but _hireling_ may sometimes be taken in its proper and less reproachful sense, for one who is _hired_ as a servant to perform an allotted work; but in general they are both reproachful epithets, the former having particular reference to the meanness of the employment, and the latter to the sordid character of the person. _Hireling_ papers are those which are in the pay of a party; a _mercenary_ principle will sometimes actuate men in the highest station.

####hold 
**HOLD, KEEP, DETAIN, RETAIN.**  
_Hold_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _healdan_, to _hold; keep_ from Anglo-Saxon _cepan_, to observe, notice, attend to. _Detain_ and _retain_ both come from the Latin _tenere_, to _hold._ The first signifies, by virtue of the particle _de_, meaning from, to _hold_ from another; the second, by virtue of the particle _re_, to _hold_ back for one's self.  
To _hold_ is a physical act; it requires a degree of bodily strength or at least the use of the limbs; to _keep_ is simply to have by one at one's pleasure. The having in one's power so that it shall not go is the leading idea in the signification of _hold;_ the durability of having is the leading idea in the word _keep:_ we may _hold_ a thing only for a moment; but what we _keep_ we _keep_ for a time. On the other hand, we may _keep_ a thing by _holding_, although we may _keep_ it by various other means: we may, therefore, _hold_ without _keeping_, and we may _keep_ without _holding._ A servant _holds_ a thing in his hand for it to be seen, but he does not _keep_ it; he gives it to his master, who puts it into his pocket, and consequently _keeps_, but does not _hold_ it. A thing may be _held_ in the hand, or _kept_ in the hand; in the former case the pressure of the hand is an essential part of the action, but in the latter case it is simply a contingent part of the action: the hand _holds_, but the person _keeps_ it. What is _held_ is fixed in position, but what is _kept_ is left loose, or otherwise, at the will of the individual. Things are _held_ by men in their hands, by beasts in their claws or mouths, by birds in their beaks; things are _kept_ by people either about their persons or in their houses, according to convenience.  
_Detain_ and _retain_ are modes of _keeping;_ the former signifies _keeping_ back what belongs to another; the latter signifies _keeping_ a long time for one's own purpose. A person may be either _held, kept, detained_, or _retained:_ when he is _held_ he is _held_ contrary to his will by the hand of another; as suspected persons are _held_ by the officers of justice, that they may not make their escape: he is _kept_, if he stops in any place, by the desire of another; as a man is _kept_ in prison until his innocence is proved, or a child is _kept_ at school until he has finished his education: he is _detained_ if he be _kept_ away from any place to which he is going or from any person to whom he belongs; as the servant of another is _detained_ to take back a letter, or one is _detained_ by business, so as to be prevented from attending to an appointment: a person is _retained_ who is _kept_ for a continuance in the service of another; as some servants are said to be _retained_, while others are dismissed.  
Things are _held_ in the improper sense: they are _kept, detained_, and _retained_ in the proper sense. A money-lender _holds_ the property of others in pledge; the idea of a temporary and partial action is here expressed by _hold_, in distinction from _keep_, which is used to express something definite and permanent: the money-lender _keeps_ the property as his own if the borrower forfeits it by breach of contract. When a person purchases anything he is expected to _keep_ it or pay the value of the thing ordered, if the tradesman fulfil his part of the engagement. What is _detained_ is _kept_ either contrary to the will, or without the consent, of the possessor: when things are suspected to be stolen, the officers have the right of _detaining_ them until inquiry be instituted. What is _retained_ is continued to be _kept;_ it supposes, however, some alteration in the terms or circumstances under which it is _kept:_ a person _retains_ his seat in a train, notwithstanding that he finds it disagreeable: or a lady _retains_ some of the articles of millinery which are sent for her choice, but she returns the rest.  
All are used in a moral application except _detain;_ in this case they are marked by a similar distinction. A person is said to _hold_ an office, by which simple possession is implied: he may _hold_ it for a long or a short time, at the will of others, or by his own will, which is not marked: he _keeps_ a situation or he _keeps_ his post, by which his continuance in the situation or at the post is denoted: but to say he _retains_ his office signifies that he might have given it up, or lost it, had he not been led to continue in it. In like manner, with regard to one's sentiments or feelings, a man is said to _hold_ certain opinions, which are ascribed to him as a part of his creed; he keeps the opinions which no one can induce him to give up; he _retains_ his old attachments, notwithstanding the lapse of years and change of circumstances which have intervened and were naturally calculated to wean him from them. See also [contain](entry://contain)  
**HOLD, OCCUPY, POSSESS.** — _Hold_ (see above). _Occupy_, in Latin _occupe_, or _ob_ and _capere_, to hold or keep near, so that it cannot be held by others, or fill a space so that it cannot be filled by any other object. _Possess_, from Latin possessus, past participle of _possideo_, or _potis_ and _sedeo_, signifies to sit as master of.  
We _hold_ a thing for a long or a short time; we _occupy_ it for a permanence: we _hold_ it for ourselves or others; we _occupy_ it only for ourselves: we _hold_ it for various purposes; we _occupy_ only for the purpose of converting it to our private use. Thus a person may _hold_ an estate, or, which is the same thing, the title-deeds to an estate, _pro tempore_, for another person's benefit; but he _occupies_ an estate if he enjoys the fruit of it. On the other hand, to _occupy_ is only to _hold_ under a certain compact; but to _possess_ is to _hold_ as one's own. The tenant _occupies_ the farm when he _holds_ it by a certain lease and cultivates it for his subsistence: but the landlord _possesses_ the farm, _possessing_ the right to let it and to receive the rent. We may _hold_ by force, or fraud, or right; we _occupy_ either by force or right; we _possess_ only by right.  
Hence we say, figuratively, to _hold_ a person in esteem or contempt, to _occupy_ a person's attention or a place, or to _possess_ one's affection.  
**HOLD, SUPPORT, MAINTAIN.** — _Hold_ is here, as in the former article, a term of very general import. Support (see [countenance](entry://countenance)) and _maintain_ (see [assist](entry://assist)) include the idea of holding with other collateral ideas in their signification.  
_Hold_ and _support_ are employed in the proper sense, _maintain_ in the improper sense. To _hold_ is a term unqualified by any circumstance; we may _hold_ a thing in any direction, _hold_ it up or down, in a straight or oblique direction: _support_ is a species of _holding_ up; to _hold_ up, however, is a personal act or a direct effort of the individual; to _support_ may be an indirect and a passive act; he who _holds_ anything up keeps it in an upright posture by the exertion of his strength; he who _supports_ a thing only bears its weight or suffers it to rest upon himself: persons or voluntary agents can _hold_ up; inanimate objects may _support:_ a servant _holds_ up a child that it may see; a pillar _supports_ a building.  
In the figurative application a person is said to _hold_ power for himself, but to _support_ the authority of another, or to have one's own mind _supported_ by circumstances or reflections. To _maintain_ is to _hold_ firmly or with vigor.  
These terms are all applied to the opinions with a similar distinction. Opinions are _held_ and _maintained_ as one's own; they are _supported_ when they are another's. We _hold_ and _maintain_ whatever we believe. We _support_ the belief or doctrine of another or what we ourselves have asserted and _maintained_ at a former time. What is _held_ is _held_ by the act of the mind within itself and as regards itself, without reference to others; but what is _maintained_ and _supported_ is openly declared to be _held;_ it is _maintained_ with others or against others; it is _supported_ in an especial manner against others; it may be _maintained_ by simple declaration or assertions; it is _supported_ by argument.  
What is _held_ may be _held_ by means of the affections, as to _hold_ a person dear, or _hold_ a thing in esteem; to _maintain_ and _support_ are applied only to speculative matters with which the understanding is engaged, as to _maintain_ or _support_ truth or error, to _maintain_ or _support_ a cause.

####holiness 
**HOLINESS, SANCTITY.**  
_Holiness_, from Anglo-Saxon _halig_, allied to _hal_, whole, and _health_, has altogether acquired a Christian signification; it respects the life and temper of a Christian. _Sanctity_, based on the Latin _sanctus_, holy, has merely a moral signification, which it derives from the _sanction_ of human authority.  
_Holiness_ is to the mind of a man what _sanctity_ is to his exterior, with this difference, that _holiness_ to a certain degree ought to belong to every man professing Christianity; but _sanctity_, as it lies in the manners, the outward garb, and deportment, is becoming only to certain persons and at certain times. _Holiness_ is a thing not to be affected; but _sanctity_, consisting in externals, is from its very nature exposed to falsehood. It becomes those who fill a sacred office, but no others. 

####hollow 
**HOLLOW, EMPTY.**  
_Hollow_, from _hole_, signifying like a hole, concerns the body itself; the absence of its own materials produces hollowness. _Empty_ concerns foreign bodies; their absence in another body constitutes _emptiness. Hollowness_ is therefore a preparative to _emptiness_, and may exist independently of it; but _emptiness_ presupposes the existence of _hollowness:_ what is _empty_ must be _hollow;_ but what is _hollow_ need not be _empty. Hollowness_ is often the natural property of a body; _emptiness_ is a contingent property: that which is _hollow_ is destined by nature to contain; but that which is _empty_ is deprived of its contents by a casualty: a nut is _hollow_ for the purpose of receiving the fruit; it is _empty_ if it contain no fruit.  
They are both employed in a moral acceptation and in a bad sense; the_ hollow_, in this case, is applied to what ought to be solid or sound, and _empty_ to what ought to be filled; a person is _hollow_ whose goodness lies only at the surface, whose fair words are without meaning; a truce is _hollow_ which is only an external cessation from hostilities: a person is _empty_ who is void of understanding and knowledge; an excuse is _empty_ which is unsupported by fact and reason; a pleasure is _empty_ which cannot afford satisfaction. 

####holy 
**HOLY, PIOUS, DEVOUT, RELIGIOUS.**  
_Holy_ (see [holiness](entry://holiness)). _Pious_, in Latin _pius_, signifies having a regard for the gods. _Devout_, in Latin _devotus_, from _devovere_, to engage by a vow, signifies _devoted_ or consecrated. _Religious_, in Latin _religiosus_, comes from _religio_, meaning attention to the worship of the gods.  
A strong regard for the Supreme Being is expressed by all these epithets; but _holy_ conveys the most comprehensive idea; _pious_ and _devout_ designate most fervor of mind; _religious_ is the most general and abstract in its signification. A _holy_ man is in all respects heavenly-minded; he is more fit for heaven than earth: _holiness_, to whatever degree it is possessed, abstracts the thoughts from sublunary objects and fixes them on things that are above. Our Saviour was a perfect pattern of _holiness;_ his apostles after him, and innumerable saints and good men, both in and out of the ministry, have striven to imitate his example by the _holiness_ of their life and conversation.  
_Pious_ is a term more restricted in its signification, and consequently more extended in application than _holy: piety_ is not a virtue peculiar to Christians; it is common to all believers in a Supreme Being; it is the homage of the heart and the affections to a superior Being: from a similarity in the relationship between a heavenly and an earthly parent, devotedness of the mind has in both cases been denominated _piety. Piety_ toward God naturally produces _piety_ toward parents; for the obedience of the heart, which gives rise to the virtue in the one case, seems instantly to dictate the exercise of it in the other. The difference between _holiness_ and _piety_ is obvious from this, that our Saviour and his apostles are characterized as _holy_, but not _pious_, because _piety_ is swallowed up in _holiness._ On the other hand, Jew and Gentile, Christian and heathen, are alike termed _pious_ when they cannot be called _holy_, because _piety_ is not only a more practicable virtue, but because it is more universally applicable to the dependent condition of man.  
_Devotion_ is a species of _piety_ peculiar to the worshipper; it bespeaks that devotedness of mind which displays itself in the temple when the individual seems by his outward services solemnly to _devote_ himself, soul and body, to the service of his Maker. _Piety_, therefore, lies in the heart and need not _appear_ externally; but _devotion_ requires to be marked by some external observance: a man _piously_ resigns himself to the will of God- in the midst of his afflictions; he prays _devoutly_ in the bosom of his family.  
_Religious_ is a term of less import than either of the other terms; it denotes little more than the simple existence of _religion_, or a sense of _religion_, in the mind: the _religious_ man is so more in his principles than in his affections; he is _religious_ in his sentiments, inasmuch as he directs all his views according to the will of his Maker; and he is _religious_ in his conduct, inasmuch as he observes the outward formalities of homage that are due to his Maker.  
When applied to things, these terms preserve a similar distinction: we speak of the _holy_ sacrament; of a _pious_ discourse, a _pious_ ejaculation; of a _devout_ exercise, a _devout_ air; a _religious_ sentiment, a _religious_ life, a _religious_ education, and the like.  
**HOLY, SACRED, DIVINE.** — _Holy_ is here, as in the former article, a term of higher import than either _sacred_, which is in Latin _sacer_, or _divine_ (see [godlike](entry://godlike)). Whatever is most intimately connected with religion and religious worship, in its purest state, is _holy_, unhallowed by a mixture of inferior objects, and elevated in the greatest possible degree, so as to suit the nature of an infinitely perfect and exalted Being. Among the Jews, the _holy_ of _holies_ was that place which was intended to approach the nearest to the heavenly abode, consequently was preserved as much as possible from all contamination with that which is earthly: among the Christians, that religion or form of religion is termed _holy_ which is esteemed purest in its doctrine, discipline, and ceremonies.  
_Sacred_ is less than _holy;_ the _sacred_ derives its sanction from human institutions and is connected rather with our moral than our religious duties; what is _holy_ is altogether spiritual, and abstracted from the earthly. The laws are _sacred_, but not _holy;_ a man's word should be _sacred_, though not _holy:_ for neither of these things is to be reverenced, but both are to be kept free from injury or external violence. The _holy_ is not so much opposed to, as it is set above, everything else; the _sacred_ is opposed to the profane: the Scriptures are properly denominated _holy_, because they are the word of God, and the fruit of His _Holy_ Spirit; but other writings may be termed _sacred_ which appertain to religion, in distinction from the profane, which appertain only to worldly matters.  
_Divine_ is a term of even less import than _sacred;_ it signifies either belonging to a deity or being like a deity; but from the looseness of its application it has lost in some respects the dignity of its meaning. The _divine_ is often contrasted with the human: but there are many human things which are denominated _divine:_ Milton's poem is entitled a _divine_ poem, not merely on account of the subject, but from the exalted manner in which the poet has treated his subject: what is _divine_, therefore, may be so superlatively excellent as to be conceived of as having the stamp of inspiration from the Deity, which, of course, as it applies to human performances, is but a hyperbolical mode of speech.

_Homage_, in Old French _homage_, from Latin _homo_, a man, signifies a man's, that is an inferior's, act of acknowledging superiority. _Homage_, in the technical sense, was an oath taken, or a service performed, by the tenant to his lord, on being admitted to his land; or by inferior princes to a sovereign, whereby they acknowledged his sovereignty and promised fidelity: in its extended and figurative sense it comprehends any solemn mark of deference, by which the superiority of another is acknowledged. _Fealty_, through Old French _fealte_, from Latin _fidelatem_, based on _fidelis_, loyal, trusty, is a lower species of _homage_, consisting only of an oath; it was made formerly by tenants, who were bound thereby to personal service under the feudal system. _Court_, which derives its meaning from the verb to _court_, woo, and seek favor, is a species of _homage_, complaisance, or deference, which is assumed for a specific purpose; it is not only voluntary, but depends upon the humor and convenience of the courtier.  
_Homage_ is paid or done to superior endowments; _court_ is paid to the contingent, not the real, superiority of the individual. _Fealty_ is figuratively employed in the sense of fidelity to one's sovereign. _Homage_ consists in any form of respect which is admitted in civil society; the Romans did _homage_ to the talents of Virgil by always rising when he entered the theatre; men do _homage_ to the wisdom of another when they do not venture to contradict his assertions or call in question his opinions. _Court_ is everything or nothing, as circumstances require; he who pays his _court_ consults the will and humor of him to whom it is paid, while he is consulting his own interest.

####honesty 
**HONESTY, PROBITY, UPRIGHTNESS, INTEGRITY.**  
_Honesty_ is the most familiar and universal term; it is applied alike to actions and principles, to a mode of conduct or a temper of mind: a person may be _honest_, a principle _honest_, or an action _honest;_ the other terms are applied to the person, as a person of _probity, uprightness_, and _integrity:_ a man is said to be _honest_ who in his dealings with others does not violate the laws; a servant is _honest_ who does not take any of the property of his master or suffer it to be taken; a tradesman is _honest_ who does not sell bad articles; and people in general are denominated _honest_ who pay what they owe and do not adopt any methods of defrauding others.  
_Honesty_ is a negative virtue; all the other terms denote positive virtues and higher characteristics. _Probity_, from_ probus_, good, and _probo_, to prove, signifying tried virtue or solid goodness, is applied not merely to the commercial dealings of men, but to all the concerns of life where truth and goodness are called into exercise. _Probity_ refers to the rights of men, giving to every one his due, whether as regards his property, reputation, honor, or any other thing on which a value is set. _Honesty_ is opposed to direct fraud, _probity_ to any species of insincerity.  
_Uprightness_, from _upright_ or _up_ and _right_, signifies bearing up in a straight and undeviating course in opposition to every temptation which may offer. _Uprightness_, therefore, supposes an independent and positive principle which forms the rule of life. Any person may be said to be _upright_ in all situations where confidence and intelligence are required, but more particularly a judge who scrupulously adheres to the dictates of an unbiassed conscience.  
_Integrity_, from _integer_, whole or sound, signifying soundness of principle, (as in Horace, "_"integer vitœ, scelerisque purus"" )_ is applied, like _uprightness_, to cases where a particular trust is reposed; but _integrity_ is taken absolutely, that is, without any reference to the outward circumstances which might tend to produce the contrary characteristic. He who faithfully discharges his trust and consults the interests of others rather than his own is justly styled a man of _integrity._ This virtue is to be looked for especially in those who fill any office.  
**HONESTY, HONOR.** — These terms both regard the principle which actuates men in the adjustment of their rights with one another. The words are both derived from the same source, namely, the Hebrew _hon_, substance or wealth, which, being the primitive source of esteem among men, became at length put for the measure or standard of esteem, namely, what is good. Hence _honesty_ and _honor_ are both founded upon what is estimable, with this difference, that _honesty_ is confined to the first principles or laws upon which civil society is founded, and _honor_ is an independent principle that extends to everything which by usage has been admitted as estimable or entitled to esteem. An _honest_ action, therefore, can never reflect so much credit on the agent as an _honorable_ action, since in the performance of the one he may be guided by motives comparatively low, whereas in the other case he is actuated solely by a fair regard for the _honor_ or the esteem of others. To a breach of _honesty_ is attached punishment and personal inconvenience in various forms; but a breach of _honor_ is only followed by disgrace or the ill opinion of others. On the other hand, _honesty_ is founded on the very first principles of human society, and _honor_ on the incidental principles which have been attached to them in the progress of time and culture; the former is positive and definite, and he who is actuated by this principle can never err; but the latter is indefinite and variable, and, as it depends upon opinion, it will easily mislead. We cannot have a false _honesty_, but we may have false _honor. Honesty_ always keeps a man within the line of his duty; but a mistaken notion of what is _honorable_ may carry a man very far from what is right, and may even lead him to run counter to common honesty.

####honor 
**HONOR, REVERENCE, RESPECT.**  
These terms agree in expressing the act of an inferior toward his superior; but _honor_ (see [glory](entry://glory)) expresses less than _reverence_ (see [adore](entry://adore)), and more than _respect_ (see [esteem](entry://esteem)).  
To _honor_ is only an outward act; to _reverence_ is either an act of the mind or the outward expression of a sentiment; to _respect_ is mostly an act of the mind, though it may admit of being expressed by some outward act. We _honor_ God by adoration and worship, as well as by the performance of His will; we _honor_ our parents by obeying them and giving them our personal service: we _reverence_ our Maker by cherishing in our minds a dread of offending Him and making a profane use of His holy name and word: we reverence our parents by holding a similar sentiment in a less degree.  
To _honor_, when applied to things, is taken in the sense of holding in _honor;_ and _respect_, to have _respect_ for, with the same distinction between them.  
**HONOR, DIGNITY.** — _Honor_ may be taken either for that which intrinsically belongs to a person or for that which is conferred on him. _Dignity_, based on the Latin _dignus_, worthy, signifying worthiness, may be equally applied to what is extrinsic or intrinsic in a man.  
In the first case _honor_ has a reference to what is esteemed by others; _dignity_ to that which is esteemed by ourselves: a sense of _honor_ impels a man to do that which is esteemed _honorable_ among men; a sense of _dignity_ to do that which is consistent with the worth and greatness of his nature: the former impels a man to elevate himself as an individual; the latter to raise himself to the standard of his species: the former may lead a person astray, but the latter is an unerring guide. It is _honor_ which makes a man draw his sword upon his friend: it is _dignity_ which makes him despise every paltry affront from others, and apologize for every apparent affront on his own part. This distinction between the terms is kept up in their application to what is extraneous of a man: _honor_ is that which is conferred on him by others; but _dignity_ is the worth or value which is added to his condition: hence we always speak of _honors_ as conferred or received; but _dignities_ as possessed or maintained. _Honors_ may sometimes be casual; but _dignities_ are always permanent: an act of condescension from the sovereign is an _honor;_ but the _dignity_ is that which exalts the man. Hence it is that _honors_ are mostly civil or political; _dignities_ may also be ecclesiastical. 

####hope 
**HOPE, EXPECTATION, TRUST, CONFIDENCE.**  
Anticipation of futurity is the common idea expressed by all these words. _Hope_ is in Anglo-Saxon _hopa. Hope_ is that which is welcome; _expectation_ (see [await](entry://await)) is either welcome or unwelcome: we _hope_ only for that which is good; we _expect_ the bad as well as the good. In bad weather we _hope_ it will soon be better; but in a bad season we _expect_ a bad harvest, and in a good season a good harvest. _Hope_ is simply a presentiment; it may vary in degree, more according to the temper of the mind than the nature of the circumstances; some _hope_ where there is no ground for _hope_, and others despair where they might _hope: expectation is_ a conviction that excludes doubt; we _expect_ in proportion as that conviction is positive: we _hope_ that which may be or can possibly be; we _expect_ that which must be or which ought to be. The young man _hopes_ to live many years; the old man _expects_ to die in a few years.  
_Hope_ and _expectation_ consist in looking for some good, _trust_ (see [belief](entry://belief)) and _confidence_ (see [confide](entry://confide)) in a dependence on a person or thing to bring about the good. We may, therefore, have either _hope_ or _expectation_ grounded on _trust_ or _confidence_, or we may have them where there is no room for either _trust_ or _confidence;_ a person may _hope_ that something good may turn up because the future is uncertain; we may _expect_ that it will rain to-day; a person may _trust_ to the skill of another, or _confide_ in his promises. _Trust_ and _confidence_ denote the same sentiment, but _trust_ is applied to objects generally, _confidence_ to particular objects; we may _trust_ partially, but we _confide_ entirely; we may _trust_ strangers, we _confide_ in friends or those we are partial to.  
_Trust_ and _confidence_ may both be applied to a man's self, or that which belongs to him, with a similar distinction.

####hot 
**HOT, FIERY, BURNING, ARDENT.**  
These terms characterize either the presence of _heat_ or the cause of _heat. Hot_, Anglo-Saxon _hat_, is the general term which marks simply the presence of _heat; fiery, i.e._, having fire, goes further, it denotes the presence of _fire_, which is the cause of _heat; burning, i.e._, in a state of burning, denotes the action of _fire_, and consequently is more expressive than the two; _ardent_ (see [fervor](entry://fervor)), which is literally the same in signification, is employed either in poetry or in application to moral objects: a room is _hot;_ a furnace or the tail of a comet _fiery;_ a coal _burning;_ the sun _ardent._  
In the figurative application, a temper is said to be _hot_ or _fiery;_ rage is _burning;_ the mind is _ardent_ in pursuit of an object. Zeal may be _hot, fiery, burning_, and _ardent_, but in the first three cases it denotes the intemperance of the mind when _heated_ by religion or politics; the last is admissible so long as it is confined to a good object.

####however 
**HOWEVER, YET, NEVERTHELESS, NOTWITHSTANDING.**  
These conjunctions are in grammar termed adversative, because they join sentences together that stand more or less in opposition to each other. _However_ is the most general and indefinite; it serves as a conclusive deduction drawn from the whole. "The truth is, _however_, not yet all come out"; by this is understood that much of the truth has been told, and much _yet_ remains to be told: so likewise in similar sentences, "I am not, _however_, of that opinion"; where it is implied either that many hold the opinion or much may be said of Ίτ·, but, be that as it may, I am not of that opinion: _"however_, you may rely on my assistance to that amount"; that is, at all events, let whatever happen, you may rely on so much of my assistance: _however_, as is obvious from the above examples, connects not only one single proposition, but many propositions either expressed or understood. _Yet, nevertheless_, and _notwithstanding_ are mostly employed to set two specific propositions either in contrast or direct opposition to each other; the latter two are but species of the former, pointing out the opposition in a more specific manner.  
There are cases in which _yet is_ peculiarly proper, others in which _nevertheless_, and others in which _notwithstanding_ are preferable. _Yet_ bespeaks a simple contrast; "Addison was not a good speaker, _yet_ he was an admirable writer; Johnson was a man of uncouth manners, _yet_ he had a good heart and a sound head"; _nevertheless_ and _notwithstanding_ could not in these cases have been substituted. _Nevertheless_ and _notwithstanding_ are mostly used to imply effects or consequences opposite to what might naturally be expected to result. "He has acted an unworthy part, _nevertheless_ I will be a friend to him as far as I can"; that is, although he has acted an unworthy part, I will be no less his friend as far as lies in my power. " _Notwithstanding_ all I have said, he still persists in his own imprudent conduct"; that is, all I have said _notwithstanding_ or not restraining him from it, he still persists. "He is still rich, _notwithstanding_ his loss"; that is, his loss _notwithstanding_, or _not standing_ in the way of it, he is still rich. From this resolution of the terms, more than from any specific rule, we may judge of their distinct applications, and clearly perceive that in such cases as those above cited the conjunctions _nevertheless_ and _notwithstanding_ could not be substituted for each other, nor _yet_ for either: in other cases, _however_, where the objects are less definitely pointed out, they may be used indifferently. "The Jesuits piqued themselves always upon their strict morality, and _yet [notwithstanding_ or _nevertheless]_ they admitted of many things not altogether consonant with moral principle. You know that these are but tales, _yet [notwithstanding, nevertheless]_ you believe them. "

####human 
**HUMAN, HUMANE.**  
Though both derived from _homo_, a man, they are thus far distinguished that _human_ is said of the genus and _humane_ of the species. The _human_ race or _human_ beings are opposed to the irrational part of the creation; a _humane_ race or a _humane_ individual is opposed to one that is cruel and fond of inflicting pain. He who is not _human_ is divested of the first and distinguishing characteristics of his kind; he who is not _humane_, of the most important and elevated characteristic that belongs to his nature.

####humble 
**HUMBLE, LOWLY, LOW.**  
_Humble_ is here compared with the other terms as it respects both persons and things. A person is said to be _humble_ on account of the state of his mind: he is said to be _lowly_ and _low_ either on account of his mind or his outward circumstances. A _humble_ person is so in his principles and in his conduct; a _lowly_ person is so in the tone of his feelings, or in his station and walk of life; a _low_ person is so either in his sentiments, in his actions, or in his rank and condition; but persons may sometimes be _low_ from particular circumstances who are not _low_ in condition. _Humility_ should form a part of the character, as it is opposed to arrogance and assumption; it is most consistent with the fallibility of our nature. _Lowliness_, in the Christian belief, should form a part of our temper, as it is opposed to an aspiring and lofty mind; it is most consistent with the temper of our Saviour, who was meek and _lowly_ of mind.  
The _humble_ and _lowly_ are always taken in a good sense; but the _low_ either in a bad or an indifferent sense. A _lowly_ man, whether as it regards his mind or his condition, is so without any moral debasement; but a man who is _low_ in his condition is likewise conceived to be _low_ in his habits and his sentiments, which is being nearly akin to the _vicious._ The same distinction is preserved in applying these terms to inanimate or spiritual objects. A _humble_ roof, a _humble_ office, a _humble_ station are associated with the highest moral worth; while a _low_ office, a _low_ situation, a _low_ birth, seem to exclude the idea of worth. See also [abase](entry://abase)  
**HUMBLE, MODEST, SUBMISSIVE.** — These terms designate a temper of mind the reverse of self-conceit or pride. The _humble_, in Latin _humilis_, low, from _humus_, the ground, signifying the lowest position, is so with regard to ourselves or others. _Modesty_ (see [modest](entry://modest)) is that which regards ourselves only: _submissiveness_, from _submissus_, signifying putting under, is that which regards others. A man is _humble_ from a sense of his comparative inferiority to others in point of station and outward circumstances; or he is _humble_ from a sense of his imperfections and a consciousness of not being what he ought to be: he is _modest_, inasmuch as he sets but little value on his qualifications, acquirements, and endowments. _Humility_ is a painful sentiment; for when it concerns others it is coupled with fear; when it concerns our own un worthiness it is coupled with sorrow: _modesty_ is a peaceful sentiment; it serves to keep the whole mind in due bounds. When _humility_ and _modesty_ show themselves in the outward conduct, the former bows itself down, the latter shrinks: a _humble_ man gives freely to others from a sense of their deserving; a _modest_ man demands nothing for himself, from an unconsciousness of deserving in himself.  
Between _humble_ and _submissive_ there is this prominent feature of distinction, that the former marks a temper of mind, the latter a mode of action: the former is, therefore, often the cause of the latter, but not so always; we may be _submissive_ because we are _humble;_ but we may likewise be _submissive_ from fear, from interested motives, from necessity, from duty, and the like; and on the other hand, we may be _humble_ without being _submissive_, when we are not brought into connection with others. A man is _humble_ when in solitude he takes a review of his sinfulness; he is _submissive_ to a master whose displeasure he dreads.  
**HUMBLE, HUMILIATE, DEGRADE.** — _Humble_ and _humiliate_ are both drawn from the same source (see above). _Degrade_ (see above).  
_Humble_ is commonly used as the act either of persons or things: a person may _humble_ himself or he may be _humbled: humiliate_ is employed to characterize things; a thing is _humiliating_ or a _humiliation._ No man _humbles_ himself by the acknowledgment of a fault; but it is a great _humiliation_ for a person to be dependent on another for a living when he has it in his power to obtain it for himself.  
To _humble_ is to bring down to the ground; it supposes a certain eminence, either created by the mind or really existing in the outward circumstances; to _degrade_ is to set down lower; it supposes steps for descending. He who is most elevated in his own esteem may be most _humbled;_ misfortunes may _humble_ the proudest conqueror: he who is most elevated in the esteem of others may be the most _degraded;_ envy is ever on the alert to _degrade._ A lesson in the school of adversity is _humbling_ to one who has known nothing but prosperity: terms of peace are _humiliating:_ low vices are peculiarly _degrading_ to a man of rank.

####humor 
**HUMOR, TEMPER, MOOD.**  
_Humor_ literally signifies moisture or fluid, in which sense it is used for the fluids of the human body; and as far as these _humors_ or their particular state is connected with, or has its influence on, the animal spirits and the moral feelings, so far is _humor_ applicable to moral agents. _Temper_ (see **disposition** under [disposal](entry://disposal)) is less specific in its signification; it may, with equal propriety, under the changed form of temperament, be applicable to the general state of the body or the mind. _Mood_, which is but a change from _mode_ or manner, has an original signification not less indefinite than the former; it is applied, however, only to the mind. As the _humors_ of the body are the most variable parts of the animal frame, _humor_ in regard to the mind denotes but a partial and transitory state when compared with the _temper_, which is a general and habitual state. The _humor_ is so fluctuating that it varies in the same mind perpetually; but the _temper_ is so far confined that it always shows itself to be the same whenever it shows itself at all: the _humor_ makes a man different from himself; the _temper_ makes him different from others. Hence we speak of the _humor_ of the moment; of the _temper_ of youth or of old age: so likewise we say, to accommodate one's self to the _humor_ of a person; to manage his _temper:_ to put one into a certain _humor;_ to correct or sour the _temper. Humor_ is not less partial in its nature than in its duration; it fixes itself often on only one object, or regards only one particular direction of feelings: _temper_ extends to all the actions and opinions as well as feelings of a man: it gives a coloring to all he says, does, thinks, and feels. We may be in a _humor_ for writing or reading; for what is gay or what is serious; for what is noisy or what is quiet; but our _temper_ is discoverable in our daily conduct; we may be in a good or ill _humor_ in company, but in domestic life and in our closest relations we show whether we are good or ill _tempered._ A man shows his _humor_ in different or trifling actions; he shows his _temper_ in the most important actions: it may be a man's _humor_ to sit while others stand, or to go unshaven while others shave; but he shows his _temper_ as a Christian or otherwise in forgiving injuries or not harboring resentments; in living peaceably, not indulging himself in contentions.  
When applied to bodies of men _humor_, as denoting a temporary or fluctuating feeling, is more commonly used than _temper. Humor_ and _mood_ agree in denoting a particular and temporary state of feeling; but they differ in the cause, the former being attributable rather to the physical state of the body, and the latter to the moral frame of the mind; the former, therefore, is independent of all external circumstances, or at all events of any that are reducible to system; the latter is guided entirely by events, or the view which the mind takes of events. _Humor_ is, therefore, generally taken in a bad sense unless actually qualified by some epithet to the contrary: _mood_ is always taken in an indifferent sense. There is no calculating on the _humor_ of a man; it depends upon his _mood_ whether he performs ill or well: it is necessary to suppress _humor_ in a child; we discover by the melancholy _mood_ of a man that something distressing has happened to him.

**HUMOR, CAPRICE.** — _Humor_ is general, _caprice_ (see [fanciful](entry://fanciful)) is particular: _humor_ may be good or bad; _caprice_ is always taken in a bad sense. _Humor_ is always independent of fixed principle; it is the feeling or impulse of the moment: _caprice is_ always opposed to fixed principle or rational motives of acting; it is the feeling of the individual setting at naught all rule and defying all reason. The feeling only is perverted when the _humor_ predominates; the judgment and will are perverted by _caprice;_ a child shows its _humor_ in fretfulness and impatience; a man betrays his _caprice_ in his intercourse with others, in the management of his concerns, or in the choice of his amusements.  
Indulgence, according to a mode of speech now practically obsolete, renders children and subordinate persons_ humorsome;_ prosperity or unlimited power is apt to render a man _capricious:_ a _humorsome_ person commonly objects to be pleased or is easily displeased; a _capricious_ person likes and dislikes, approves and disapproves the same thing in quick succession.  
_Humorsome, Humorous, Capricious_ — _Humor_, when applied to things, has the sense of wit, whence the distinction between _humorsome_ and _humorous_, the former implying the existence of _humor_ or perverted feeling in the person; the latter implying the existence of _humor_ or wit in the person or thing. _Caprice_ is improperly applied to things to designate their total irregularity and planlessness of proceeding, as, in speaking of fashion, we notice its _caprice_ when that which has been laid aside is again taken into use; diseases are termed _capricious_ which act in direct opposition to all established rule. 

####hunt 
**HUNT, CHASE.**  
The leading idea in the word _hunt_ from Anglo-Saxon _huntian_, to capture, is that of searching after; the leading idea in the word _chase_ is that of driving away or before one. In a strict sense, _hunt_ denotes a search for objects not within sight; _chase_ is a pursuit after such objects only as are within sight: we may _hunt_, therefore, without _chasing:_ we may _chase_ without _hunting:_ a person _hunts_ after, but does not _chase_ that which is lost: a boy _chases_, but does not _hunt_, a butterfly. When applied to field sports, the _hunt_ commences as soon as the huntsman begins to look for the game; the _chase_ commences as soon as it is found: on this ground, perhaps, it is that _hunt_ is used, in familiar discourse, to designate the specific act of taking this amusement; and _chase_ is used only in particular cases where the peculiar idea is to be expressed: a _foxhunt_, or a _stag-hunt_, is said to take place on a particular day; or that there has been no _hunting_ this season, or that the _hunt_ has been very bad: but we speak, on the other hand, of the pleasures of the _chase_, or that the _chase_ lasted very long; the animal gave a long _chase._

####hurtful 
**HURTFUL, PERNICIOUS, NOXIOUS, NOISOME.**  
Between _hurtful_, signifying full of _hurt_, and _pernicious_ there is the same distinction as between _hurting_ and destroying: that which is _hurtful_ may _hurt_ in various ways; but that which is _pernicious_ necessarily tends to destruction: confinement is _hurtful_ to the health: bad company is _pernicious_ to the morals, or the doctrines of free-thinkers are said to be _pernicious_ to the well-being of society. _Noxious_ and _noisome_, from _nocere_, to _hurt_, are species of the _hurtful:_ things may be _hurtful_ both to body and mind; _noxious_ and _noisome_ only to the body: that which is _noxious_ inflicts a direct injury; that which is _noisome_ inflicts it indirectly: _noxious_ insects are such as wound; _noisome_ vapors are such as tend to create disorders. 

####husband 
**HUSBAND, CONSERVE, ECONOMIZE.**  
_Husband_, from the Icelandic _husbondi_, that contracted from _husbuandi_, compound of _hus_, a house, and _buandi_, a dwelling, all imply the male head of a household. In the present application the term signifies to manage one's affairs with frugality, to use one's resources so as to produce the best results.  
_Conserve_, from Latin _conservare_, means primarily to save. We _conserve_ our health and property by adopting such methods as will save them from depreciation, injury, loss, or destruction. _We economize_ our health, time, and property by managing each with care, prudence, and a proper regard for their value. _Economize_ has an original meaning similar to that of _husband_, being derived from the Greek word for house, and indicating the management of the household. _Husband_, however, means primarily prudence in saving, in gathering together, and conserving resources; _economize_ signifies prudence in spending.

####hypnotism 
**HYPNOTISM, MESMERISM, ANIMAL MAGNETISM.**  
The difference between these three words is not a difference in meaning, but a difference in the theory implied in them, and in fashionable and professional usage. _Hypnotism_ replaced _mesmerism_, and _mesmerism animal magnetism_ in professional usage as names for the same phenomenon. This phenomenon is a peculiar condition of the nervous system induced by a fixed, abstracted attention of the mental and visual eye on one object not of an exciting nature. It was called _animal magnetism_ by F. A. Mesmer, because he believed in a magnetic force in animals, peculiar to living beings, by which one acts on another just as the magnet acts on steel; to this the inducing of the hypnotic state was due. The phenomenon was by others called _mesmerism_, after Mesmer (about 1766), because it was made known to the public everywhere chiefly through his somewhat spectacular methods of producing it. _Mesmerism_ refers, then, primarily to the manner of inducing a hypnotic condition. The term _hypnotism_, from _υπνος_, sleep, and _νευρον_, nerve, was coined in 1842 by James Braid, who was the first to investigate the subject in a physiological way. This name was intended to imply that the phenomenon was due not to any occult magnetic force, inherent in organic life everywhere, but to a peculiar condition of the nerves. His name replaced _mesmerism_ in popular usage. 

####hypochondriacal 
**HYPOCHONDRIACAL, MELANCHOLIC, SPLENETIC.**  
These words all refer to an abnormal psychological condition supposed tο be produced or accompanied by a disorder of the _spleen;_ but they indicate slightly different psychological states.  
_Hypochondriacal_ (from Greek _ύπό_ and _χόνδρια_, the parts beneath the breastbone, _i.e._, the spleen) is the adjective corresponding to _hypochondria_, a gloomy and irritable state of mind in which the subject believes that his health is in a very serious condition and that he is threatened with death. _Melancholic_ (Greek _μελαγχολία_, black bile, referring to secretions of the spleen) refers simply to a state of morbid gloom. _Splenetic_ from Latin _splen_, Greek _σπλήν_, spleen, refers to a state of morbid gloom especially characterized by irritableness of temper, a disposition to take offence at everything. 

####hypocrite 
**HYPOCRITE, DISSEMBLER.**  
_Hypocrite_, in Greek _ύποκριτής_, from _ύπό_ and _κρίνομαι_, signifies one playing a. part on a stage. _Dissembler_, from _dissemble_, in Latin _dissimula_ or _dis_ and _similis_, signifies one who makes himself appear unlike what he really is.  
The _hypocrite_ feigns to be what he is not; the _dissembler_ conceals what he is: the former takes to himself the credit of virtues which he has not; the latter conceals the vices that he has; every_ hypocrite_ is a _dissembler;_ but every _dissembler_ is not a _hypocrite:_ the _hypocrite_ makes truth serve the purpose of falsehood; the _dissembler_ is content with making falsehood serve his own particular purpose.

_Idea_, in Latin _idea_, in Greek _ίδέα_, from the root found in Latin _videre_, to see, signifies the thing seen in the mind. _Thought_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _thencan_, modern English _think. Imagination_ signifies the thing _imagined_, from Latin _imago_, from the root _im_, found in _imitare_, English _imitate._  
The _idea_ is the simple representation of an object; the thought is the reflection; and the _imagination_ is the combination of _ideas:_ we have _ideas_ of the sun, the moon, and all material objects; we have _thoughts_ on moral subjects; we have _imaginations_ drawn from the _ideas_ already existing in the mind. _Ideas_ are formed; they are the rude materials with which the _thinking_ faculty exerts itself: _thoughts_ arise in the mind by means of association and combination, or recur in the mind by the power of the memory; they are the materials with which the _thinking_ faculty employs itself: _imaginations_ are created by the mind's reaction on itself; they are the materials with which the understanding seeks to enrich itself. The term _ideas_ is used in all cases for the mental representation, abstractedly from the agent that represents them: hence _ideas_ are attached to words; _ideas_ are analyzed, confounded, and the like; in which cases the word _thought_ could not be substituted. _Thought_ belongs only to thinking and rational beings: the animals may be said to have _ideas_, but not _thoughts:_ hence _thoughts_ are either mean, fine, grovelling, or sublime, according to the nature of the mind in which they exist: hence we say with more propriety, to indulge a _thought_ than to indulge an _idea;_ to express one's _thoughts_, rather than one's _ideas_, on any subject: although the latter term _idea_, on account of its comprehensive use, may, without violation of any express rule, be indifferently employed in general discourse for _thought;_ but the former term does not on this account lose its characteristic meaning. _Imagination_ is not only the fruit of _thought_, but of peculiar _thought:_ the _thought_ may be another's: the _imagination_ is one's own: the _thought_ occurs and recurs; it comes and it goes; it is retained or rejected at the pleasure of the _thinking_ being: the _imagination_ is framed by the power which we term _imagination;_ it is cherished with the partiality of a parent for its offspring. _Thoughts_ are busied with the surrounding objects; _imaginations_ are employed on distant and strange objects: hence _thoughts_ are denominated sober, chaste, and the like; _imaginations_, wild and extravagant.

**IDEAL, IMAGINARY.** — _Ideal_ does not strictly adhere to the sense of its primitive, _idea:_ the _idea_ is the representation of a real object in the mind; but _ideal_ signifies belonging to the _idea_ independently of the reality or the external object. _Imaginary_ preserves the signification of its primitive, _imagination_ (see **fancy** under [fanciful](entry://fanciful)) denotes what is created by the mind itself. The _ideal_ is not directly opposed to, but abstracted from the real; the _imaginary_, on the other hand, is directly opposed to the real; it is the unreal thing formed by the _imagination. Ideal_ happiness is the happiness which is formed in the mind without having any direct and actual prototype in nature; but it may, nevertheless, be something possible to be realized; it may be above nature, but not in direct contradiction to it: the _imaginary_ is that which is opposite to some positive existing reality; the pleasure which a lunatic derives from the conceit of being a king is altogether _imaginary._

####idle 
**IDLE, LAZY, INDOLENT.**  
_Idle_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _idel_, vain, empty. _Lazy_ comes from Low German _lasich_, allied to loose, signifying languid, idle. _Indolent_, in Latin _indolens_, from _in_, not, and _dolens_, from _dolere_, to grieve, signifies not grieving, lacking in feeling; hence, lacking in life and energy.  
A propensity to inaction is the common idea by which these words are connected; they differ in the cause and degree of the quality: _idle_ expresses less than _lazy_, and _lazy_ less than _indolent:_ one is termed _idle_ who will do nothing useful; one is _lazy_ who will do nothing at all without great reluctance; one is _indolent_ who does not care to do anything or set about anything. There is no direct inaction in the _idler;_ for a child is _idle_ who will not learn his lesson, but he is active enough in that which pleases himself: there is an aversion to corporeal action in a _lazy_ man, but not always to mental action; he is _lazy_ at work, _lazy_ in walking, or _lazy_ in sitting; but he may not object to any employment, such as reading or thinking, which leaves his body entirely at rest: an _indolent_ man, on the contrary, fails in activity from a defect both in the mind and the body; he will not only not move, but he will not even think, if it give him trouble; and trifling exertions of any kind are sufficient, even in prospect, to deter him from attempting to move.  
_Lazy_ is figuratively applied to other objects.  
_Idle_ is also applied to things in the sense of leisure and vanity, for which see the next analysis.  
**IDLE, LEISURE, VACANT.** — _Idle_ is opposed here to busy; _leisure_ comes from Anglo-French _leisir_, originally the infinitive mood, signifying to be permitted, from Latin _licere._ He, therefore, who is _idle_, instead of being busy, commits a fault; which is not always the case with him who is at _leisure_ or free from his employment. _Idle_ is always taken in a sense more or less unfavorable; _leisure_ in a sense perfectly indifferent: if a man says of himself that he has spent an _idle hour_ in this or that place, in amusement, company, and the like, he means to signify he would have spent it better if anything had offered; on the other hand, he would say that he spends his _leisure_ moments in a suitable relaxation: he who values his time will take care to have as few _idle_ hours as possible; but since no one can always be employed in severe labor, he will occupy his _leisure_ hours in that which best suits his taste.  
_Idle_ and _leisure_ are said in particular reference to the time that is employed; _vacant_ (see FILL) is a more general term that simply qualifies the thing an _idle_ hour is one without any proper employment; a _vacant_ hour is in general one free from the employments with which it might be filled; a person has _leisure_ time according to his wishes; but he may have _vacant_ time from necessity; that is, when he is in want of employment.  
**IDLE, VAIN.** — These epithets are both opposed to the solid or substantial; but _idle_ has a more particular reference to what ought or ought not to engage the time or attention; _vain_, in Latin _vanus_, signifying empty, seems to qualify the thing without any such reference. A pursuit may be termed either _idle_ or _vain:_ in the former case, it reflects immediately on the agent for not employing his time on something more serious; but in the latter case it simply characterizes the pursuit as one that will be attended with no good consequences: when we consider ourselves as beings who have but a short time to live, and that every moment of that time ought to be thoroughly well spent, we should be careful to avoid all _idle_ concerns; when we consider ourselves as rational beings, who are responsible for the use of those powers with which we have been invested by God we shall be careful to reject all _vain_ concerns: an _idle_ effort is made by one who does not care to exert himself for any useful purpose, who works only to please himself; a _vain_ effort may be made by one who is in a state of desperation.

####ignorant 
**IGNORANT, ILLITERATE, UNLEARNED, UNLETTERED.**  
_Ignorant_, in Latin _ignorans_, from the privative _in_, and the root _gno_, signifying to know, signifies not knowing things in general, or not knowing any particular circumstance. _Unlearned, illiterate_, and _unlettered_ are compared with _ignorant_ in the general sense.  
_Ignorant_ is a comprehensive term; it includes any degree from the highest to the lowest, and consequently includes the other terms, _illiterate, unlearned_, and _unlettered_, which express different forms of _ignorance. Ignorance_ is not always to one's disgrace, since it is not always one's fault; the term is not, therefore, directly reproachful: the poor, _ignorant_ savage is an object of pity rather than condemnation; but when _ignorance_ is coupled with self-conceit and presumption, it is a real deformity: hence the word _illiterate_, which is mostly used in such cases, has become a term of reproach: an _ignorant_ man who sets up to teach others is termed an _illiterate_ preacher; and quacks, whether in religion or medicine, from the very nature of their calling, are altogether an _illiterate_ race of men. The term _illiterate_ is in all cases taken for one who is without education or even the knowledge of his letters; the words _unlearned_ and _unlettered_ are disengaged from any unfavorable associations. A modest man, who makes no pretensions to learning, may suitably apologize for his supposed deficiencies by saying he is an _unlearned_ or _unlettered_ man; the former is, however, a term of more familiar use than the latter. A man may be described either as generally _unlearned_ or as _unlearned_ in particular sciences or arts; as _unlearned_ in history; _unlearned_ in philosophy; _unlearned_ in the ways of the world: a rustic poet's muse may be described as _unlettered._

####illuminate 
**ILLUMINATE, ILLUMINE, ENLIGHTEN.**  
_Illuminate_, in Latin _illuminatus_, participle of _illumina_ (from Latin _in_, and _lumen_, light), and _enlighten_, coined with the French _en_, from the verb _lighten_, both denote the communication of light; the former in the natural, the latter in the moral sense. We _illuminate_ by means of artificial lights; or, as in the case of mediaeval manuscripts (though, in this sense, the term is now obsolete) by color: the sun _illuminates_ the world by its own light: preaching and instruction _enlighten_ the minds of men. _Illumine_ is but a poetic variation of _illuminate;_ as, the Sun of  
Righteousness _illumined_ the benighted world; _illuminations_ are employed as public demonstrations of joy; no nation is now termed _enlightened_ but such as has received the light of the Gospel.

####imitate 
**IMITATE, COPY, COUNTERFEIT.**  
The idea of taking a likeness of some object is common to all these terms; but _imitate_ (see [follow](entry://follow)) is the generic: _copy_ (see that word) and _counterfeit_, through French _contrefait_, from the Latin _contra_, against, and _facere_, to make, signifying to make in opposition to the reality, are the specific terms: to _imitate_ is to take a general likeness; to _copy_, to take an exact likeness; to _counterfeit_, to take a false likeness: to _imitate_ is, therefore, almost always used in a good or an indifferent sense; to _copy_ mostly, and to _counterfeit_ still oftener, in a bad sense: to _imitate_ an author's style is at all times allowable for one who cannot form a style for himself; but to _copy_ an author s style would be a too slavish adherence even for the dullest writer.  
To _imitate_ is applicable to every object, for every external object is susceptible of _imitation;_ and in man the _imitative_ faculty displays itself alike in the highest and the lowest matters, in works of art and moral conduct: to _copy_ is applicable only to certain objects which will admit of a minute likeness being taken; thus, an artist may be said to _copy_ from nature.  
To _counterfeit_ is applicable to but few objects: we may _counterfeit_ coin, which is an unlawful act, or we may _counterfeit_ the person, the character, the voice, or the handwriting of any one for whom we would wish to pass, which is also an unlawful act except on the stage.  
**IMITATE, MIMIC, APE, MOCK.** — To _imitate_ is here the general term: to _mimic_, from the Greek _μίμος_, an actor or mimic, and to _ape_, signifying to _imitate_ like an _ape_ (Anglo-Saxon _apa_, German _affe)_, are both species of vicious _imitation._ One _imitates_ that which is deserving of _imitation_, or the contrary: one _mimics_ either that which is not an authorized subject of _imitation_ or which is _imitated_ imperfectly or so as to excite laughter. A person wishes to make that his own which he _imitates_, but he _mimics_ for the entertainment of others.  
To _ape_ is a serious, though an absurd, act of _imitation._ To _mock_, Old French _mocquer_, a Picard form for _moucher_, to wipe the nose, Latin _muccare_, to blow the nose (from Latin _mucus_, English _mucus)_, indicating a vulgar gesture of contempt, signifies to laugh at, and is an ill-natured and vulgar act of _imitation._ The ape _imitates_ to please himself; the mocker _mocks_ to insult others.

####imminent 
**IMMINENT, IMPENDING, THREATENING.**  
_Imminent_, in Latin _imminens_, from _minere_, to project, signifies resting or coming upon. _Impending_, from the Latin _pendere_, to hang, signifies hanging upon or over. _Threat_, Anglo-Saxon _threotan_, to afflict, vex, urge, is allied to Latin _trudere_ (found in _intrude_ and _obtrude)_, signifying to push, work, urge.  
All these terms are used in regard to some evil that is exceedingly near: _imminent_ conveys no idea of duration; _impending_ excludes the idea of what is momentary. A person may be in _imminent_ danger of losing his life in one instant, and the danger may be over the next instant: but an _impending_ danger is that which has been long in existence and gradually approaching; we can seldom escape _imminent_ danger by any efforts of our own: but we may be successfully warned to escape from an _impending_ danger. _Imminent_ and _impending_ are said of dangers that are not discoverable; but a _threatening_ evil gives intimations of its own approach; we perceive the _threatening_ tempest in the blackness of the sky; we hear the _threatening_ sounds of the enemy's clashing sword. 

####immoderate 
See **excessive** under [excess](entry://excess)

####immodest 
**IMMODEST, IMPUDENT, SHAMELESS.**  
_Immodest_ signifies the want of _modesty: impudent_ and _shameless_ signify without _shame. Immodest_ is less than either _impudent_ or _shameless:_ an _immodest_ girl lays aside the ornament of her sex and puts on another garb that is less becoming; but her heart need not be corrupt until she becomes _impudent:_ she lacks a good quality when she is _immodest;_ she is possessed of a positively bad quality when she is _impudent._ There is always hope that an _immodest_ woman may be conscious of her error, and amend; but of an _impudent_ woman there is no such chance — she is radically corrupt. _Impudent_ may characterize the person or the thing: _shameless_, from Anglo-Saxon _sceamu_, shame, and negative suffix, characterizes the person. A person's air, look, and words are _impudent_ when contrary to all modesty: the person himself is _shameless_ who is devoid of all sense of shame.

####impair 
**IMPAIR, INJURE.**  
_Impair_ comes through Old French _empeirer_, from Late Latin _impeiorare_, compounded of the Latin _in_ and _peior_, worse, signifying to make worse. _Injure_, from _in_, against, and _iur_, the stem of _ius_, right, signifies to make otherwise than it ought to be.  
_Impair_ seems to be in regard to _injury_ as the species to the genus; what is _impaired_ is _injured_, but what is _injured_ is not necessarily _impaired._ To _impair_ is a progressive mode of _injuring:_ an _injury_ may take place either by degrees or by an instantaneous act: straining of the eyes _impairs_ the sight, but a blow _injures_ rather than _impairs_ the eye. A man's health may be _impaired_ or _injured_ by his vices, but his limbs are _injured_ rather than _impaired_ by a fall. A person's circumstances are _impaired_ by a succession of misfortunes; they are _injured_ by a sudden turn of fortune.

####imperfection 
**IMPERFECTION, DEFECT, FAULT, VICE.**  
These terms are applied either to persons or to things. _Imperfection_, denoting either the abstract quality of _imperfect_ or the thing which constitutes it _imperfect_, in a person arises from his want of _perfection_ and the infirmity of his nature; there is no one without some point of _imperfection_ which is obvious to others, if not to himself; he may strive to diminish it, although he cannot expect to get altogether rid of it: a _defect_ (see [blemish](entry://blemish)) is a deviation from the general constitution of man; it is what may be natural to the man as an individual, but not natural to man as a species; in this manner we may speak of a _defect_ in the speech, or a _defect_ in temper. The _fault_ and _vice_ rise in degree and character above either of the former terms; they both reflect disgrace more or less on the person possessing them; but the _fault_ always characterizes the agent, and is said in relation to an individual; the _vice_, from Latin _vitium_, a vice or fault, characterizes the action and may be considered abstractedly: hence we speak of a man's _faults_ as the things we may condemn in him; but we may speak of the _vices_ of drunkenness, lying, and the like, without any immediate reference to any one who practices these _vices._ When they are both employed for an individual their distinction is obvious: the _fault_ may lessen the amiability or excellence of the character; the _vice_ is a stain; a single act destroys its purity; a habitual practice is a pollution.  
In regard to things, the distinction depends upon the preceding explanation in a great measure, for we can scarcely use these words without thinking on man as a moral agent, who was made the most perfect of all creatures, and became the most _imperfect;_ and from our _imperfection_ has arisen, also, a general _imperfection_ throughout all the works of creation. The word _imperfection_ is therefore the most unqualified term of all: there may be _imperfection_ in regard to our Maker, or there may be _imperfection_ in regard to what we conceive of _perfection;_ and in this case the term simply and generally implies whatever falls short in any degree or manner of _perfection. Defect_ is a positive degree of _imperfection;_ it is contrary both to our ideas of _perfection_ and to our particular intention: thus, there may be a _defect_ in the materials of which a thing is made; or a _defect_ in the mode of making it: the term _defect_, however, whether said of persons or things, characterizes rather the object than the agent. _Fault_, on the other hand, when said of things, always refers to the agent: thus we may say there is a _defect_ in the glass, or a _defect_ in the spring; but there is a _fault_ in the workmanship, or a _fault_ in the putting together, and the like. _Vice_, with regard to things, is properly a serious or radical _defect;_ the former lies in the constitution of the whole, the latter may lie in the parts; the former lies in essentials, the latter lies in the accidents: there may be a _defect_ in the shape or make of a horse; but the _vice_ is said in regard to his soundness or unsoundness, his docility or indocility.  
**IMPERFECTION, WEAKNESS, FRAILTY, FAILING, FOIBLE.** — _Imperfection_ has already been considered as that which in the most extended sense diminishes the moral _perfection_ of man; the rest are but modes of _imperfection_ varying in degree and circumstances. _Weakness_ is a positive and strong degree of _imperfection_ which is opposed to strength; it is what we do not so necessarily look for, and therefore distinguishes the individual who is liable to it. _Frailty_ is another strong mode of _imperfection_ which characterizes the fragility of man, but not of all men in the same degree; it differs from _weakness_ in respect to the object. A _weakness_ lies more in the judgment or in the sentiment; _frailty_ lies more in the moral features of an action. It is _weakness_ in a man to yield to the persuasions of any one against his better judgment; it is _frailty_ to yield to intemperance or illicit indulgences. _Failings_ and _foibles_ (from Old French _foible_, English _feeble_, Latin _flebilis_, doleful, from _flere_, to weep) are the smallest degrees of _imperfection_ to which the human character is liable: we all have our _failings_ in temper, and our _foibles_ in our habits and our prepossessions; and he, as Horace observes, is the best who has the fewest. 

####imperious 
**IMPERIOUS, LORDLY, DOMINEERING, OVERBEARING.**  
All these epithets imply an unseemly exercise or affectation of power or superiority. _Imperious_, from _imperare_, to command, characterizes either the disposition to command without adequate authority or to convey one's commands in an offensive manner: _lordly_ (from Anglo-Saxon _hlaford_, lord, from _hlaf_, bread — English _loaf_ — and _weard_, guard, English _ward_, signifying the guardian of the loaf) characterizes the manner of acting the _lord:_ and _domineering_, from _dominus_, a _lord_, denotes the manner of ruling like a _lord_, or rather of attempting to rule; hence a person's temper or his tone is denominated _imperious;_ his air or deportment is _lordly;_ his tone is _domineering._ A woman of an _imperious_ temper commands in order to be obeyed; she commands with an _imperious_ tone in order to enforce obedience. A person assumes a _lordly_ air in order to display his own importance; he gives orders in a _domineering_ tone in order to make others feel their inferiority. There is always something offensive in _imperiousness;_ there is frequently something ludicrous in that which is _lordly;_ and a mixture of the ludicrous and offensive, in that which is _domineering._  
These terms are employed for such as are invested with some sort of power, or endowed with some sort of superiority, however trifling; but _overbearing_ is employed for men in the general relations of society, whether superiors or equals. A man of an _imperious_ temper and some talent will frequently be so _overbearing_ in the assemblies of his equals as to awe the rest into silence and carry every measure of his own without contradiction.

####impertinent 
**IMPERTINENT, RUDE, SAUCY, IMPUDENT, INSOLENT.**  
_Impertinent_, in Latin _in_, a privative prefix, and _pertinent_, belonging, signifies being or wanting to do what it does not belong to one to be or do. _Rude_, in Latin _rudis_, rude, signifies literally unpolished, and, in an extended sense, wanting all culture. _Saucy_ comes from _sauce_, in Latin _sals, a_, feminine of _salsus_, salt, signifying literally full of sauce, pungent, and, in an extended sense, stinging like salt. _Impudent_ (see [assurance](entry://assurance)). _Insolent_, from the Latin _insolens_, is a word of doubtful origin, possibly compounded of _in_, against, and _solens_, from a root signifying to swell — referring here to the swelling of pride.  
_Impertinent_ is allied to _rude_, as regards one's general relations in society, without regard to station; it is allied to _saucy, impudent_, and _insolent_ as regards the conduct of inferiors. He who does not respect the laws of civil society in his intercourse with individuals, and wants to assume to himself what belongs to another, is _impertinent:_ if he carry this _impertinence_ so far as to commit any violent breach of decorum in his behavior, he is _rude. Impertinence_ seems to spring from a too high regard of one's self: _rudeness_ from an ignorance of what is due to others. _Impertinent_, in comparison with the other terms, _saucy, impudent_, and _insolent_, is the most general and indefinite: whatever one does or says that is not compatible with one's station is _impertinent; saucy_ is a sharp kind of _impertinence: impudent_ an unblushing kind of _impertinence; insolence_ is an outrageous kind of _impertinence_, it runs counter to all established order: thus, the terms seem to rise in sense. A person may be _impertinent_ in words or actions: he is _saucy_ in words or looks: he is _impudent_ or _insolent_ in words, tones, gesture, looks, and every species of action. 

####impervious 
**IMPERVIOUS, IMPASSABLE, INACCESSIBLE.**  
_Impervious_, from the Latin _in, per_, and _via_, signifies not having a way through; _impassable_, not to be passed through; _inaccessible_, not to be approached. A wood is _impervious_ when the trees, branches, and leaves are entangled to such a degree as to admit of no passage at all: a river is _impassable_ that is so deep that it cannot be forded: a rock or a mountain is _inaccessible_ the summit of which is not to be reached by any path whatever. What is _impervious_ is so for a permanency; what is _impassable_ is commonly so only for a time: roads are frequently _impassable_ in the winter that are _passable_ in the summer, while a thicket is _impervious_ during the whole of the year: _impassable_ is likewise said only of that which is to be passed by living creatures, but _impervious_ may be extended to inanimate objects; a wood may be _impervious_ to the rays of the sun.

####impious

####implacable 
**IMPLACABLE, UNRELENTING, RELENTLESS, INEXORABLE.**  
_Implacable_, from Latin _in_, privative, and _placere_, to please, signifies not to be softened or pleased. _Unrelenting_, from the Latin _lentus_, slow, slack, soft, signifies not rendered soft. _Inexorable_, from _oro_, pray, signifies not to be turned by prayers.  
Inflexibility is the idea expressed in common by these terms, but they differ in the causes and circumstances with which it is attended. Animosities are _implacable_ when no misery which we occasion can diminish their force, and no concessions on the part of the offender can lessen the spirit of revenge: the mind or character of a man is _unrelenting_ when it is not to be turned from its purpose by a view of the pain which it inflicts: a man is _inexorable_ who turns a deaf ear to every solicitation or entreaty that is made to induce him to lessen the rigor of his sentence. A man's angry passions render him _implacable;_ it is not the magnitude of the offence, but the temper of the offended that is here in question; by _implacability_ he is rendered insensible to the misery he occasions and to every satisfaction which the offender may offer him: fixedness of purpose renders a man _unrelenting_ or _relentless;_ an _unrelenting_ temper is not less callous to the misery produced than an _implacable_ temper; but it is not grounded always on resentment for personal injuries, but sometimes on a certain principle of right and a sense of necessity: the _inexorable_ man adheres to this rule, as the _unrelenting_ man does to his purpose; the former is insensible to any workings of his heart which might shake his purpose, the latter turns a deaf ear to all the solicitations of others which would go to alter his decrees: savages are mostly _implacable_ in their animosities; Titus  
Manlius Torquatus displayed an instance of _unrelenting_ severity toward his son; Minos, Æacus, and Rhadamanthus were the _inexorable_ judges of hell.  
_Implacable_ and _unrelenting_ are said only of animate beings in whom is wanting an ordinary portion of the tender affections: _inexorable_ may be improperly applied to inanimate objects; justice and death are both represented as _inexorable._

####implant 
**IMPLANT, INGRAFT, INCULCATE, INSTIL, INFUSE.**  
To _plant_ is properly to fix plants in the ground; to _implant_ is, in the improper sense, to fix principles in the mind. To _ingraft_, from _graft_, to make one plant grow on the stock of another, is to make particular principles flourish in the mind and form a part of the character. _Inculcate_, from Latin _in_ and _culcare_, for _calcare_, or tread into, means to stamp into the mind. To _instil_, from French _instiller_, derived from Latin _in_ and _stillare_, to drop into, is, in the improper sense, to make sentiments, as it were, drop into the mind. To infuse, from _in_ and _fusus_, past participle of _fundere_, to pour, is, in the improper sense, to pour principles or feelings into the mind.  
To _implant, ingraft_, and _inculcate_ are said of abstract opinions or rules of right and wrong; _instil_ and _infuse_ of such principles as influence the heart, the affections, and the passions. It is the business of the parent in early life to _implant_ sentiments of virtue in his child; it is the business of the teacher to _ingraft_ them. _Instil_ is a corresponding act with _implant;_ we _implant_ belief; we _instil_ the feeling which is connected with this belief. It is not enough to have an abstract belief of a God _implanted_ into the mind: we must likewise have a love, and a fear of Him, and reverence for His holy name and Word _instilled_ into the mind. To _instil_ is a gradual process which is the natural work of education; to _infuse_ is a more arbitrary and immediate act. Sentiments are _instilled_ into the mind, not altogether by the personal efforts of any individual, but likewise by collateral endeavors; they are, however, _infused_ at the express will and with the express endeavor of some person. _Instil_ is applicable only to permanent sentiments; _infuse_ may be said of any partial feeling: hence we speak of _infusing_ poison into the mind by means of insidious and mischievous publications; or _infusing_ jealousy by means of crafty insinuations, or _infusing_ ardor into the minds of soldiers by means of spirited addresses coupled with military successes. 

####implicate 
**IMPLICATE, INVOLVE.**  
_Implicate_, from _plicare_, to fold, denotes to fold into a thing; and _involve_, from _volvere_, to roll, signifies to roll into a thing: by which explanation we perceive that to _implicate_ marks something less entangled than to _involve:_ for that which is folded may be folded only once, but that which is rolled is turned many times. In application, therefore, to human affairs, people are said to be _implicated_ who have taken ever so small a share in a transaction; but they are _involved_ only when they are deeply concerned: the former is likewise especially applied to criminal transactions, the latter to those things which are in themselves troublesome: thus a man is _implicated_ in the guilt of robbery who should stand by and see it done, without interfering for its prevention; he who is in debt in every direction is strictly said to be _involved_ in debt.

####importance 
**IMPORTANCE, CONSEQUENCE, WEIGHT, MOMENT.**  
_Importance_, from _in_ and _portare_, to carry, signifies the carrying or bearing with or in itself. _Consequence_, from the present participial stem of _consequi_, to follow, or result, signifies that which follows or results from a thing. _Weight_, Anglo-Saxon _gewiht_, from _wegan_, to carry, or lift (compare the phrase _weigh_ anchor), hence to weigh, signifies the quantity that a tiling weighs. _Moment_, from _momentum_, Latin _movere_, to move, signifies the force that puts in motion.  
_Importance_ is what things have in themselves; they may be of more or less _importance_, according to the value which is set upon them: this may be real or unreal; it may be estimated by the experience of their past utility or from the presumption of their utility for the future: the idea of _importance_, therefore, enters into the meaning of the other terms more or less. _Consequence_ is the _importance_ of a thing from its _consequences._ This term, therefore, is peculiarly applicable to such things the _consequences_ of which may be more immediately discerned either from the neglect or the attention: it is of _consequence_ for a letter to go off on a certain day, for the affairs of an individual may be more or less affected by it; an hour's delay sometimes in the departure of a military expedition may be of such _consequence_ as to determine the fate of a battle. The term _weight_ implies a positively great degree of _importance:_ it is that _importance_ which a thing has intrinsically in itself, and which makes it _weigh_ in the mind: it is applied, therefore, to such things as offer themselves to deliberation; hence the counsels of a nation are always _weighty_, because they involve the interests of so many. _Moment_ is that _importance_ which a thing has from the power in itself to produce effects or to determine interests: it is applicable, therefore, only to such things as are connected with our prosperity or happiness: when used without any adjunct, it implies a great degree of _importance_, but may be modified in various ways, as a thing of no _moment_, or small _moment_, or great _moment;_ but we cannot say with the same propriety, a thing of small _weight_, and still less a thing of great _weight:_ it is a matter of no small _moment_ for every one to choose that course of conduct which will stand the test of a death-bed reflection.

####imprint 
**IMPRINT, IMPRESS, ENGRAVE.**  
_Print_ and _press_ are both derived from Latin _primere_, the former from the infinitive, the latter from _pressus_, the past participle, signifying in the literal sense to press or to make a mark by pressing: to _impress_ and _imprint_ are figuratively employed in the same sense. Things are _impressed_ on the mind so as to produce a conviction: they are _imprinted_ on it so as to produce recollection. If the truths of Christianity be _impressed_ on the mind, they will show themselves in a corresponding conduct: whatever is _imprinted_ on the mind in early life or by any particular circumstance is not readily forgotten. _Engrave_, from French _en_ and _grave_, imitating Old French _engraver_, from Latin _in_ and Old High German _graban_, to cut, or dig, cognate with English _grave_, to dig, expresses more in the proper sense than either, _imprint_, or _impress_ and the same in its moral application; for we may truly say that if the truths of Christianity be _engraven_ in the minds of youth, they can never be eradicated.

####impugn 
**IMPUGN, ATTACK.**  
These terms are employed synonymously only in regard to doctrines or opinions; in which case, to _impugn_, from _in_, against, and _pugnare_, to fight, signifies to call in question, or bring arguments against; to _attack_ is to oppose with warmth. Sceptics _impugn_ every opinion, however self-evident or well-grounded they may be: infidels make _attacks_ upon the Bible and all that is held sacred by the rest of the world. He who _impugns_ may sometimes proceed insidiously and circuitously to undermine the faith of others: he who _attacks_ always proceeds with more or less violence. To _impugn_ is not necessarily taken in a bad sense; we may sometimes _impugn_ absurd doctrines by a fair train of reasoning: to _attack_ (see [attack](entry://attack)) is sometimes objectionable, either in the mode of the action or its object, or in both; it is a mode of proceeding which may be employed either in the cause of falsehood or of truth: when there are no arguments wherewith to _impugn_ a doctrine, it is easy to _attack_ it with ridicule and scurrility: it is one's duty to _attack an_ absurd or an erroneous, or a criminal doctrine, in the interest of truth and progress. 

####impute 
See [ascribe](entry://ascribe)

####inability 
**INABILITY, DISABILITY.**  
_Inability_ denotes the absence of _ability_ (see [ability](entry://ability)) in the most general and abstract sense. _Disability_ implies the absence of _ability_ only in particular cases: the _inability_ lies in the nature of the thing, and is irremediable; the _disability_ lies in the circumstances, and may sometimes be removed: weakness, whether physical or mental, will occasion an _inability_ to perform a task; there is a total _inability_ in an infant to walk and act like an adult: a want of knowledge or of the requisite qualifications may be a _disability;_ in this manner minority of age or an objection to take certain oaths may be a _disability_ for filling a public office. 

####inaccessible 
See [impervious](entry://impervious)

####inactive 
**INACTIVE, INERT, LAZY, SLOTHFUL, SLUGGISH.**  
A reluctance to bodily exertion is common to all these terms. _Inactive_ (see [active](entry://active)) is the most general and unqualified term of all; it expresses simply the want of a stimulus to exertion. _Inert_ is something more positive, from the Latin _in_, privative) and _ars_, art, without skill or mind; it denotes a specific deficiency either in body or in mind. _Lazy_ (see [idle](entry://idle)). _Slothful_ comes from _sloth_, which is formed from the adjective _slow_, originally _slowth_, and signifies full of slowness; and _sluggish_, from _slug_ (a Scandinavian word signifying to droop, and hence, to be _inactive_, drowsy, heavy), denote an expressly defective temperament of the body which directly impedes action.  
To be _inactive_ is to be indisposed to action, that is, to the performance of any office, to doing any specific business: to be _inert_ is somewhat more; it is to be indisposed to movement; to be _lazy_ is to move with pain to one's self: to be _slothful_ is never to move otherwise than slowly: to be _sluggish_ is to move in a sleepy and heavy manner. A person may be _inactive_ from a variety of incidental causes, as timidity, ignorance, modesty, and the like, which combine to make him averse to enter upon any business or take any serious step; a person may be _inert_ from temporary indisposition; but _laziness, slothfulness_, and _sluggishness_ are inherent physical defects: _laziness_ is, however, not altogether independent of the mind or the will; but _slothfulness_ and _sluggishness_ are purely the offspring of nature, or, which is the same thing, habit superinduced upon nature. A man of a mild character is frequently _inactive._  
Some diseases, particularly of the melancholy kind, are accompanied with a strong degree of _inertness_, since they seem to deprive the frame of its ordinary powers to action, and to produce a certain degree of torpor; hence the term is properly applied to matter to express the highest degree of _inactivity_, which will not move without an external impulse.  
_hazy_ people move as if their bodies were a burden to themselves; they are fond of rest and particularly averse to be put in action; but they will sometimes move quickly, and perform much when once impelled to move.  
_Slothful_ people never vary their pace; they have a physical impediment in themselves to quick motion: _sluggish_ people are with difficulty brought into action; it is their nature to be in a state of stupor. 

####inadequate 
See [incapable](entry://incapable)

####inadvertency 
**INADVERTENCY, INATTENTION, OVERSIGHT.**  
_Inadvertency_, from _advert_, to turn the mind to, is allied to _inattention_ (see **attentive** under [attend](entry://attend)) when the act of the mind is signified in general terms; and to _oversight_ when any particular instance of _inadvertency_ occurs. _Inadvertency_ never designates a habit, but _inattention_ does; the former term, therefore, is unqualified by the reproachful sense which attaches to the latter: any one may be guilty of _inadvertencies_, since the mind that is occupied with many subjects equally serious may not be turned so steadily toward some others that may escape notice; but _inattention_, which designates a direct want of _attention_, is always a fault, and belongs only to the young, or such as are thoughtless by nature: since _inadvertency_ is an occasional act, it must not be too often repeated, or it becomes _inattention._ An _oversight_ is properly a species of _inadvertency_, which arises from looking over, or passing by, a thing: we pardon an _inadvertency_ in another, since the consequences are never serious; we must be guarded against _oversights_ in business, as their consequences may be serious.

####incapable 
**INCAPABLE, INSUFFICIENT, INCOMPETENT, INADEQUATE.**  
_Incapable_, that is, _not_ having _capacity_ (see [ability](entry://ability)); _insufficient_, or _not sufficient_, or _not_ having what is _sufficient; incompetent_, or _not competent_ (see [competent](entry://competent)), are employed either for persons or for things: the first in a general, the last two in a specific sense: _inadequate_, or _not adequate_ or equalled, is applied most generally to things.  
When a man is said to be _incapable_ it characterizes his whole mind; if he be said to have _insufficiency_ and _incompetency_, it regards the particular objects to which the power is applied: he may be _insufficient_ or _incompetent_ for certain things; but he may have a _capacity_ for other things: the term _incapacity_, therefore, implies a direct charge upon the understanding which is not implied by _insufficiency_ and _incompetency. Incapable_ is applied sometimes, in colloquial discourse, to signify the absence of that which is bad; _insufficient_ and _incompetent_ always convey the idea of a deficiency in that which is at least desirable: it is an honor to a person to be _incapable_ of falsehood, or _incapable_ of doing an ungenerous action; but to be _insufficient_ and _incompetent_ are, at all events, qualities not to be boasted of, although they may not be expressly disgraceful. These terms are likewise applicable to things, in which they preserve a similar distinction: infidelity is _incapable_ of affording a man any comfort: when the means are _insufficient_ for obtaining the ends, it is madness to expect success; it is a sad condition of humanity when a man's resources are _incompetent_ to supply him with the first necessaries of life.  
_Inadequate_ is relative in its signification, like _insufficient_ and _incompetent;_ but the relation is different. A thing is _insufficient_ which does not suffice either for the wishes, the purposes, or the necessities of any one in particular or in general cases; thus, a quantity of materials may be _insufficient_ for a particular building: _incompetency_ is an _insufficiency_ for general purposes in things of the first necessity; thus, a person may be _incompetent_ to support a family: _inadequacy_ is still more particular, for it denotes any deficiency which is measured by comparison with the object to which it referred; thus, the strength of an animal may be _inadequate_ to the labor which is required, or a reward may be _inadequate_ to the service. 

####incessantly 
**INCESSANTLY, UNCEASINGLY, UNINTERRUPTEDLY, WITHOUT INTERMISSION.**  
_Incessantly_ and _unceasingly_ are but variations of the same word, Latin _cessare_, to _cease_, a frequentative of _cedere_, to yield; _in_ and _un_ are both negative prefixes. _Uninterruptedly_ (see [disturb](entry://disturb)). _Intermission_ (see [subside](entry://subside)).  
Continuity, but not duration, is denoted by these terms: _incessantly_ is the most general and indefinite of all; it signifies without ceasing, but may be applied to things which admit of certain intervals: _unceasingly_ is definite, and signifies never ceasing; it cannot, therefore, be applied to what has any cessation. In familiar discourse, _incessantly_ is an extravagant mode of speech, by which one means to denote the absence of those ordinary intervals which are to be expected; as when one says a person is _incessantly_ talking, by which is understood that he does not allow himself the ordinary intervals of rest from talking: _unceasingly_, on the other hand, is more literally employed for a positive want of cessation; a noise is said to be _unceasing_ which literally never ceases; or complaints are _unceasing_ which are made without any pauses or intervals. _Incessantly_ and _unceasingly_ are said of things which act of themselves; _uninterruptedly_ is said of that which depends upon other things: it rains _incessantly_ marks a continued operation of nature, independent of everything; but to be _uninterruptedly_ happy marks one's freedom from every foreign influence which is unfriendly to one's happiness. _Incessantly_ and the other two words are employed either for persons or things; _without intermission_ is, however, mostly employed for persons; things act and react _incessantly_ upon one another; a man of a persevering temper goes on laboring _without intermission_ until he has effected his purpose.

####inclination 
**INCLINATION, TENDENCY, PROPENSITY, PRONENESS.**  
All these terms are employed to designate the state of the will toward an object: _inclination_ (see [attachment](entry://attachment)) denotes its first movement toward an object: _tendency_, through French from _tendere_, to stretch, is a continued _inclination: propensity_, from _propensus_, past participle of the Latin _pro_, forward, and _pendere_, to hang, denotes a still stronger leaning of the will; and _prone_, from the Latin _pronum_, accusative of _pronus_, inclined toward, characterizes a habitual and fixed state of the will toward an object. The _inclination_ expresses the leaning, but not the direction of that leaning; it may be to the right or to the left, upward or downward; consequently we may have an _inclination_ to that which is good or bad, high or low; _tendency_ does not specify any particular direction; but it is frequently applied to those things which degenerate or lead to what is bad; excessive strictness in the treatment of children has a _tendency_ to damp their spirit: _propensity_ and _proneness_ both designate a downward direction, and consequently refer only to that which is bad and low; a person has a _propensity_ to drinking, and a _proneness_ to lying.  
_Inclination_ is always at the command of the understanding; it is our duty, therefore, to suppress the first risings of any _inclination_ to extravagance, intemperance, or any irregularity: as _tendency_ refers to the thing rather than the person, it is our business to avoid that which has a _tendency_ to evil: the _propensity_ will soon get the mastery of the best principles and the firmest resolution; it is our duty, therefore, to seek all the aids which religion affords to subdue every _propensity: proneness_ to evil is inherent in our nature, which we derive from our animal nature; it is the grace of God alone which can lift us up above this grovelling part of ourselves.

**INCLOSE, INCLUDE.**  
From the Latin _includo_ (from _in_, in, and _claudere_, to shut) are derived _inclose_ and _include, inclose_ being derived through Old French _inclore_, past participle _inclos._ The former expresses the proper, and the latter the improper signification: a yard is _inclosed_ by a wall; particular goods are _included_ in a reckoning: the kernel of a nut is _inclosed_ in a shell; morality, as well as faith, is _included_ in Christian perfection.

####inconsistent 
**INCONSISTENT, INCONGRUOUS, INCOHERENT.**  
_Inconsistent_, from _in_, privative, and _consistent_ (Latin _con_, together, and _sistens_, participle of _sistere_, to cause to stand), marks the unfitness of being placed together. _Incongruous_, from _in_, privative, and _congruere_, to suit, a Latin word of uncertain origin, marks the unsuitableness of one thing to another. _Incoherent_, from _in_, privative, _con_, together, and _hœrere_, to stick, marks the incapacity of two things to coalesce or be united to each other.  
_Inconsistency_ attaches either to the actions or sentiments of men; _incongruity_ attaches to the modes and qualities of things; _incoherency_, to words or thoughts; things are made _inconsistent_ by an act of the will; a man acts or thinks _inconsistently_, according to his own pleasure: _incongruity_ depends upon the nature of the things; there is something very _incongruous_ in blending the solemn service of the church with the extravagant rant of some self-styled religious leaders: _incoherence_ marks the want of coherence in that which ought to follow sequently; extemporary effusions from the pulpit are often distinguished most by their _incoherence._

####inconvenience 
**INCONVENIENCE, ANNOY, MOLEST.**  
To _inconvenience_ is to make _not convenient_ (see [convenient](entry://convenient)). TO _annoy_ comes from the Old French _anoi_, Modern French _ennui_, derived from the Latin phrase _in odio_, signifying in hatred, or dislike. To _molest_, from the Latin _moles_, a mass, or weight, signifies to press with a weight.  
We _inconvenience_ in small matters, or by omitting such things as might be _convenient;_ we _annoy_ or _molest_ by doing that which is positively painful: we are _inconvenienced_ by a person's absence; we are _annoyed_ by his presence if he renders himself offensive: we are _inconvenienced_ by what is temporary; we are _annoyed_ by that which is either temporary or durable; we are _molested_ by that which is weighty and oppressive; we are _inconvenienced_ simply in regard to our circumstances; we are _annoyed_ mostly in regard to our corporeal feelings; we are _molested_ mostly in regard to our minds: the removal of a seat or a book may _inconvenience_ one who is engaged in business; the buzzing of a fly or the stinging of a gnat may _annoy;_ the impertinent freedom or the rude insults of ill-disposed persons may _molest._

####incorporeal 
**INCORPOREAL, UNBODIED, IMMATERIAL, SPIRITUAL.**  
_Incorporeal_ (see **corporeal** under [corporal](entry://corporal)for derivation) maries the quality of not belonging to the body or having any properties in common with it; _unbodied_ (for derivation see **corporeal** under [corporal](entry://corporal)) denotes the state of being without the body or not inclosed in a body: a thing may therefore be _incorporeal_ without being _unbodied;_ but not _vice versa:_ the soul of man is _incorporeal_, but not _unbodied_, during his natural life.  
_Incorporeal_ is always used in regard to living things, particularly by way of comparison with _corporeal_ or human beings: hence we speak of _incorporeal_ agency, or _incorporeal_ agents, in reference to such beings as are supposed to act in this world without the help of the body; but _immaterial_ is applied to inanimate objects; men are _corporeal_ as men, spirits are _incorporeal;_ the body is the _material_ part of man, the soul his _immaterial_ part: whatever external object acts upon the senses is _material;_ but the action of the mind on itself, and its results, are all _immaterial:_ the earth, sun, moon, etc., are termed _material;_ but the impressions which they make on the mind, that is, our ideas of them, are _immaterial._  
The _incorporeal_ and _immaterial_ have always a relative sense; the _spiritual_ is that which is positive: God is a _spiritual_, not properly an _incorporeal_ nor _immaterial_ Being: the angels are likewise designated, in general, as the _spiritual_ inhabitants of heaven; although, when spoken of in regard to men, they may be denominated _incorporeal._  
See also **corporeal** under [corporal](entry://corporal)

####increase 
**INCREASE, GROW.**  
_Increase_, from the Latin _in_, in, and _crescere_, to grow (whence _crescent_ is derived), signifies to grow larger and stronger. _Grow_, Anglo-Saxon _growan_, signified to put forth green shoots; it is allied to the word _green._  
The idea of becoming larger is common to both these terms, but the former expresses the idea in an unqualified manner, and the latter annexes to this general idea also that of the mode or process by which this is effected. To _increase_ is either a gradual or an instantaneous act; to _grow_ is a gradual process: a stream _increases_ by the addition of other waters; it may come suddenly or in course of time, by means of gentle showers or the rushing in of other streams; but if we say that the river or stream _grows_, it is supposed to _grow_ by some regular and continual process of receiving fresh water, as from the running in of different rivulets or smaller streams. To _increase_ is either a natural or an artificial process; to _grow_ is always natural: money _increases_ by artificial means; corn may either _increase_ or _grow:_ in the former case we speak of it in the sense of becoming larger or _increasing_ in bulk; in the latter case we consider the mode of its _increasing_, namely, by the natural process of vegetation. On this ground we say that a child _grows_ when we wish to denote the natural process by which his body arrives at its proper size; but we may speak of bis _increasing_ in stature, in size, and the like. For this reason likewise _increase_ is used in a transitive as well as intransitive sense; but _grow_ always in an intransitive sense: we can _increase_ a thing, though not properly _grow_ a thing, because we can make it larger by whatever means we please; but when it _grows_ it makes itself larger.  
In their improper acceptation these words preserve the same distinction: "trade _increases_" bespeaks the simple fact of its becoming larger; but "trade _grows"_ implies that gradual _increase_ which flows from the natural concurrence of circumstances. The affections which are awakened in infancy _grow_ with one's growth; a natural and moral process is here combined. The fear of death sometimes _increases_ as one _grows_ old; the courage of a truly brave man _increases_ with the sight of danger: a moral process is here indicated which is both gradual and immediate, but in both cases produced by some foreign cause.  
See also [enlarge](entry://enlarge)  
**INCREASE, ADDITION, ACCESSION, AUGMENTATION.** — _Increase_ is here, as in the former article, the generic term: there will always be _increase_ where there is _augmentation, addition_, and _accession_, though not _vice versa. Addition_ is to _increase_ as the means to the end: the _addition_ is the artificial mode of making two things into one; the _increase_ is the result: when the value of one figure is added to another, the sum is _increased;_ hence a man's treasures experience an _increase_ by the _addition_ of other parts to the main stock. _Addition_ is an intentional mode of _increasing; accession_ is an accidental mode: one thing is added to another and thereby _increased;_ but an _accession_ takes place of itself; it is the coming or joining of one thing to another so as to _increase_ the whole. A merchant _increases_ his property by _adding_ his gains in trade every year to the mass; but he receives an _accession_ of property either by inheritance or by any other contingency. In the same manner a monarch _increases_ his dominions by _adding_ one territory to another, or by various _accessions_ of territory which fall to his lot. When we speak of an _increase_ we think of the whole and its relative magnitude at different times; when we speak of an _addition_ we think only of the part and the agency by which this part is joined; when we speak of an _accession_ we think only of the circumstance by which one thing becomes thus joined to another. _Increase_ of happiness does not depend upon _increase_ of wealth; the miser makes daily _additions_ to the latter without making any to the former: sudden _accessions_ of wealth are seldom attended with any good consequences, as they turn the thoughts too violently out of their sober channel and bend them too strongly on present possessions and good-fortune.  
_Augmentation_ is a mode of _increasing_ not merely in quantity or number, but also in value or in the essential ingredient of a thing; it is therefore applied for the most part to the _increase_ of a man's estate, possessions, family, income, or whatever is desirable.  
It may also be applied to moral objects, as hopes, fears, joys, etc., with a like distinction.

####indebted 
**INDEBTED, OBLIGED.**  
_Indebted_ is more binding and positive than _obliged:_ we are _indebted_ to whoever confers an essential service: we are _obliged_ to him who does us any service. A man is _indebted_ to another for the preservation of his life; he is _obliged_ to him for an ordinary act of civility: a _debt_, whether of legal or moral right, must in justice be paid; an _obligation_ which is only moral ought in reason to be returned. We may be _indebted_ to things; we are _obliged_ to persons only: we are _indebted_ to Christianity, not only for a superior faith, but also for a superior system of morality; we ought to be _obliged_ to our friends who admonish us of our faults in friendly wise. A nation may be _indebted_ to an individual, but men are _obliged_ to one another only as individuals: the English nation is _indebted_ to Alfred for the groundwork of its constitution; the little courtesies which pass between friends in their social intercourse with one another lay them under _obligations_ which it is equally agreeable to receive and to pay. 

####indecent 
**INDECENT, IMMODEST, INDELICATE.**  
_Indecent_ is the contrary of _decent_ (see [becoming](entry://becoming)), _immodest_ the contrary of _modest_ (see [modest](entry://modest)), _indelicate_ the contrary of _delicate_ (see [fine](entry://fine)).  
_Indecency_ and _immodesty_ violate the fundamental principles of morality: the former, however, in external matters, as dress, words, and looks; the latter in conduct and disposition. A person may be _indecent_ for want of either knowing or thinking better. _Indecency_ may be a partial, _immodesty_ is a positive and entire breach of the moral law. _Indecency_ belongs to both sexes; _immodesty_ is peculiarly applicable to the misconduct of women.  
_Indecency_ is less than _immodesty_, but more than _indelicacy:_ they both regard the outward behavior. It is a great _indecency_ for a man to marry again very quickly after the death of his wife; but a still greater _indecency_ for a woman to put such an affront on her deceased husband: it is a great _indelicacy_ in any one to break in upon the retirement of such as are in sorrow and mourning.

####indemnify 
**INDEMNIFY, COMPENSATE, REIMBURSE.**  
These terms all mean to make good that which has been lost, but they differ somewhat in the extent of their application. _Compensate_, from Latin _con_, against, and _pensare_, to weigh, means, literally, to weigh one thing with another; it is the most genera! of these three terms. It signifies to give back an equivalent for something lost, taken, or injured. _Indemnify_ and _reimburse_ have a similar meaning, but a more special application. _Indemnify_ is derived from Latin _in_, privative, _damnum_, loss, and French _fier_, English _fy_, from Latin _facere_, to make. Hence it literally means to make free from loss. It signifies to make a payment to compensate for the loss of life or property. _Reimburse_ is adapted from French _rembourser_ by substituting Latin _re_, again, and _in_, in, for _rem. Bowser_ comes from Latin _bursa_, a purse, Greek _βύρση_, a hide (purses being usually made of leather), which appears in English as _purse._ Hence it signifies literally to make in purse again, and refers to the payment of money in return for money paid out. We _compensate_ another for the trouble that he has taken for us by an act of generosity or favor; the United States sought to _indemnify_ itself for the loss of life and property through the attacks of German submarines on trading vessels; we _reimburse_ a friend who has lent us money or paid our debts by returning a sum equivalent to that which he spent. To _indemnify_ and to _reimburse_ are forms of _compensation._

**INDIFFERENCE, INSENSIBILITY, APATHY.**  
_Indifference_ signifies _no difference_, that is, having no _difference_ of feeling for one thing more than another. _Insensibility_, from Latin _in_, privative, and _sentire_, to know through the senses, to feel, signifies incapability of feeling, _Apathy_, from Greek _άπάθεια_, from _à_, not, and _παθειν_, to suffer (found in _pathetic, pathos, sympathy_, etc.), signifies incapability to suffer or to feel.  
_Indifference_ is a partial state of the mind; _insensibility_ and _apathy_ are general states of the mind; he who has _indifference_ is not to be awakened to feeling by some objects, though he may by others; but he who has not _sensibility_ is incapable of feeling; and he who has _apathy_ is without any feeling. _Indifference_ is mostly a temporary state; _insensibility_ is either a temporary or a permanent state; _apathy_ is always a permanent state: _indifference_ is either acquired or accidental; _insensibility_ is either produced or natural; _apathy_ is natural. A person may be in a state of _indifference_ about a thing of the value of which he is not aware, or acquire an _indifference_ for that which he knows to be of comparatively little value: he may be in a state of _insensibility_ from some lethargic torpor which has seized his mind; or he may have a habitual _insensibility_ arising from the physical bluntness of his understanding or the deadness of his passions; his _apathy_ is born with him, and forms a prominent feature in the constitution of his mind.  
**INDIFFERENT, UNCONCERNED, REGARDLESS.** — _Indifferent_ marks the want of inclination: _unconcerned_, that is, having no _concern_ (see [care](entry://care)), and _regardless_, that is, without _regard_, mark the want of serious consideration. _Indifferent_ regards only the will; _unconcerned_, either the will or the understanding; _regardless_, the understanding only: we are _indifferent_ about matters of minor consideration; we are _unconcerned_ or _regardless_ about serious matters that have remote consequences: an author will seldom be _indifferent_ about the success of his work; he ought not to be _unconcerned_ about the influence which his writings may have on the public, or _regardless_ of the estimation in which his own character as a man may be held. To be _indifferent_ is sometimes an act of wisdom or virtue; to be _unconcerned_ or _regardless_ is mostly an act of folly or a breach of duty.

####indignity 
**INDIGNITY, INSULT.**  
_Indignity_, from the Latin _dignus_, worthy, signifying unworthy treatment, regards the feeling and condition of the person offended; _insult_ (see [affront](entry://affront)) regards the temper of the offending party. We measure the _indignity_ in our own mind; it depends upon the consciousness we have of our own worth: we measure the _insult_ by the disposition which is discovered in another to degrade us. Persons in high stations are peculiarly exposed to _indignities:_ persons in every station may be exposed to _insults. Indignities_ may, however, be offered to persons of all ranks; but in this case it always consists of more violence than a simple _insult;_ it would be an _indignity_ to a person of any rank to be compelled to do any office which belongs only to a beast of burden.

####indistinct 
**INDISTINCT, CONFUSED.**  
_Indistinct_ is negative; it marks simply the want of _distinctness: confused_ is positive; it marks a positive degree of _indistinctness._ A thing may be _indistinct_ without being _confused;_ but it cannot be _confused_ without being _indistinct:_ two things may be _indistinct_ or not easily distinguished from each other; but many things, or parts of the, same things, are _confused:_ two letters in a word may be _indistinct_, but the whole of a writing or many words are _confused:_ sounds are _indistinct_ which reach our ears only in part, but they are _confused_ if they come in great numbers and out of all order. We see objects _indistinctly_ when we cannot see all the features by which they would be distinguished from other objects: we see them _confusedly_ when every part is so blended with the other that no one feature can be distinguished; by means of great distance objects become _indistinct;_ from a defect in sight objects become more _confused._

####indolent 
**INDOLENT, SUPINE, LISTLESS, CARELESS.**  
For _indolent (in_, not, and _dolens_, suffering, or freedom from pain, hence ease, idleness). See [idle](entry://idle) _Supine_, in Latin _supinus_, from _super_, above, signifies lying on one's back or with one's face upward, which, as it is the. action of a lazy or idle person, has been made to represent the qualities themselves. _Listless_, without _list_, in German _lust_, desire, signifies without desire. _Careless_ signifies without care or concern.  
These terms represent a diseased or unnatural state of the mind when its desires, which are the springs of action, are in a relaxed and torpid state, so as to prevent the necessary degree of exertion. _Indolence_ has a more comprehensive meaning than _supineness_, and this signifies more than _listlessness_ or _carelessness: indolence_ is a general indisposition of a person to exert either his mind or his body; _supineness_ is a similar indisposition that shows itself on particular occasions: there is a corporeal as well as a mental cause for _indolence;_ but _supineness_ lies principally in the mind: corpulent and large-made people are apt to be _indolent;_ but timid and gentle dispositions are apt to be _supine._  
The _indolent_ and _supine_ are not, however, like the _listless_, expressly without desire: an _indolent_ or _supine_ man has desire enough to enjoy what is within his reach, although not always sufficient desire to surmount the aversion to labor in trying to obtain it; the _listless_ man, on the contrary, is altogether without the desire, and is, in fact, in a state of moral torpor, which is, however, but a temporary or partial state arising from particular circumstances; after the mind has been wrought up to the highest pitch, it will sometimes sink into a state of relaxation in which it ceases to have apparently any active principle within itself.  
_Carelessness_ expresses less than any of the above; for, though a man who is _indolent, supine_, and _listless_ is naturally _careless_, yet _carelessness_ is properly applicable to such as have no such positive disease of mind or body. _Carelessness_ is rather an error of the understanding, or of the conduct, than the will; since the _careless_ man would _care_, be concerned for, or interested about things if he could be brought to reflect on their importance or if he did not for a time forget himself. 

####indubitable 
**INDUBITABLE, UNQUESTIONABLE, INDISPUTABLE, UNDENIABLE, INCONTROVERTIBLE, IRREFRAGABLE.**  
_Indubitable_ signifies admitting of no _doubt; unquestionable_, admitting of no _question_ (for both see [doubt](entry://doubt)); _indisputable_, admitting of no _dispute_ (see [controvert](entry://controvert)); _undeniable_, not to be _denied_ (see [deny](entry://deny)); _incontrovertible_, not to be _controverted; irrefragable_ comes from _in_, against, and a root _frag_, meaning noise, found also, perhaps, in _suffrage_, and signifies not to be changed by a popular outcry. These terms are all opposed to uncertainty; but they do not imply absolute certainty, for they all express the strong persuasion of a person's mind rather than the absolute nature of the thing: when a fact is supported by such evidence as admits of no kind of doubt it is termed _indubitable;_ when the truth of an assertion rests on the authority of a man whose character for integrity stands unimpeached it is termed _unquestionable_ authority; when a thing is believed to exist on the evidence of every man's senses it is termed _undeniable;_ when a sentiment has always been held as either true or false, without dispute, it is termed _indisputable;_ when arguments have never been controverted they are termed _incontrovertible;_ and when they have never been satisfactorily answered they are termed _irrefragable._

####indulgent 
**INDULGENT, FOND.**  
_Indulgence_ (see [gratify](entry://gratify)) lies more in forbearing from the exercise of authority; _fondness_ (see [amorous](entry://amorous)) in the outward behavior and endearments: they may both arise from an excess of kindness or love, but the former is of a less objectionable character than the latter. _Indulgence_ may be sometimes wrong, but _fondness_ is seldom right: an _indulgent_ parent is seldom a prudent parent, but a _fond_ parent does not rise above a fool: all who have the care of young people should occasionally relax from the strictness of the disciplinarian and show an _indulgence_ where a suitable opportunity offers; a _fond_ mother takes away from the value of _indulgence_ by an invariable compliance with the humors of her children. However, when applied generally or abstractedly the words are both taken in a good sense.

####infallible 
**INFALLIBLE, CERTAIN, POSITIVE, SURE, UNERRING.**  
_Infallible_, a compound of _in_, not, and _fallible_, failing, erring, from the Latin _fallere_, to deceive, in French _infaillible_, signifies the quality of being free from the liability of error. _Certain_ (from Latin _certus_, sure, and the suffix _-anus_, allied to _cernere_, to discriminate) implies that which is fixed, stated, beyond a doubt, anything that is undeniable, indisputable, incontrovertible. _Positive_ concerns that which is real, actual, substantial, existing in fact, and is applicable both to persons and to objects. When, however, the term is related to persons, as a belief or statement, while it may be advanced as absolutely _positive_, the premises or basic knowledge may be erroneous, and the conclusion, therefore, will not be _infallible_, though the person may believe it to be so.  
_Sure_ implies conditions similar to those that are _positive_, and, literally, those that are absolutely fixed, established beyond question, and _unerring;_ yet in mortal mind the term at times appears to belie itself, to be fluctuating, as something that to-day has every evidence of being _sure_ may tomorrow prove a delusion, but this is a mere mental misconstruction of the term. _Unerring_ is a term that in common usage is frequently misapplied. God alone is _unerring_, incapable of mistakes or failure. We speak of a marksman taking an _unerring_ aim, but his action is not completed till his shot has struck its object, and in the meantime a chance change of wind may alter its direction, and though the aim was direct the result is not an _unerring_ shot.  
Associated with _infallible_ is the substantive _infallibility_, implying the state or quality of being exempt from error. At the Œcumenical Council of the Roman Catholic Church, held in Rome in 1870, a dogma was decreed to the effect that when the Roman Pontiff, speaking _ex cathedra_, or in the discharge of his office, "defines a doctrine regarding faith or morals to be held by the Universal Church, (he) is possessed of that _infallibility_ with which the Divine Redeemer willed that his Church should be endowed, " and "that therefore such definitions of the Roman Pontiff are irreformable. "

####infamous 
**INFAMOUS, SCANDALOUS.**  
_Infamous_, like _infamy_ (see **infamy** below), is applied to both persons and things; _scandalous_, only to things: a character is _infamous_, or a transaction is _infamous;_ but a transaction only is _scandalous. Infamous_ and _scandalous_ are both said of that which is calculated to excite great displeasure in the minds of all who hear it, and to degrade the offenders in the general estimation; but the _infamous_ seems to be that which produces greater publicity and more general reprehension than the _scandalous;_ consequently is that which is more serious in its nature and a greater violation of good morals. Some men of daring character render themselves _infamous_ by their violence, their rapine, and their murders; the trick which was played upon the subscribers to the South Sea Company was a _scandalous_ fraud.  
**INFAMY, IGNOMINY, OPPROBRIUM.** — _Infamy_ is the opposite to good _fame;_ it consists in an evil report. _Ignominy_, from the privative _in_ and Latin _gnomin_ for _gnomen_, old form of _nomen_, name, signifies an ill name, a stained name. _Opprobrium_, a Latin word, compounded of _ob_, on, and _probrum_, disgrace, signifies the highest degree of reproach or stain.  
The idea of discredit or disgrace in the highest possible degree is common to all these terms: but _infamy_ is that which attaches either to the person or to the thing; _ignominy_ is thrown upon the person; and _opprobrium_ is thrown upon the agent rather than the action. _Infamy_ causes either the person or the thing to be ill spoken of by all; abhorrence of both is expressed by every mouth, and the ill report spreads from mouth to mouth: _ignominy_ causes the name and the person to be held in contempt; it becomes debased in the eyes of others; _opprobrium_ causes the person to be spoken of in severe terms of reproach, and to be shunned as something polluted. The _infamy_ of a treacherous proceeding is increased by the addition of ingratitude; the _ignominy_ of a public punishment is increased by the wickedness of the offender; _opprobrium_ sometimes falls upon the innocent, when circumstances seem to convict them of guilt.

####influence 
**INFLUENCE, AUTHORITY, ASCENDENCY or ASCENDENT, SWAY.**  
_Influence_ (see [credit](entry://credit)). _Authority_, in Latin _auctoritas_, from _auctor_, the author or prime mover of a thing (originally the _increaser_ or _grower_, from _augere_, to increase), signifies that power which is vested in the prime mover of any business. _Ascendency_, from _ascend_ (see [arise](entry://arise)), signifies having the upper hand. _Sway_ comes from Middle English _sweiyen_, sway, a word with many Teutonic parallels, allied to _swagger._  
These terms imply power, under different circumstances: _influence_ is altogether unconnected with any right to direct; _authority_ includes the idea of right necessarily; superiority of rank, talent, or property, personal attachment, and a variety of circumstances give _influence;_ it commonly acts by persuasion, and employs engaging manners, so as to determine in favor of what is proposed: superior wisdom, age, office, and relation give _authority;_ it determines of itself, it requires no collateral aid: _ascendency_ and _sway_ are modes of _influence_ differing only in degree; they both imply an excessive and improper degree of _influence_ over the mind, independent of reason: the former is, however, more gradual in its process, and consequently more confirmed in its nature; the latter may be only temporary, but may be more violent. A person employs many arts, and for a length of time, to gain the _ascendency;_ but he exerts a _sway_ by a violent stretch of power. It is of great importance for those who have _influence_ to conduct themselves consistently with their rank and station: men are apt to regard the warnings and admonitions of a true friend as an odious assumption of _authority_, while they voluntarily give themselves up to the _ascendency_ which a valet or a mistress has gained over them, who exert the most unwarrantable _sway_ to serve their own interested and vicious purposes.  
_Influence_ and _ascendency_ are said likewise of things as well as persons: true religion will have an _influence_ not only on the outward conduct of a man, but on the inward affections of his heart; and that man is truly happy in whose mind it has the _ascendency_ over every other principle. 

####inform 
**INFORM, MAKE KNOWN, ACQUAINT, APPRISE.**  
The idea of bringing to the knowledge of one or more persons is common to all these terms. _Inform_, from the Latin _informare_, to shape within, signifies the creative power of knowledge working within the soul; it is therefore the generic term, and the rest specific: to _inform_ is to communicate what has lately happened, or the contrary; but to _make known_ is to bring to light what has long been _known_ and purposely concealed: to _inform_ is to communicate directly or indirectly to one or many; to _make known_ is mostly to communicate indirectly to many: one _informs_ the public of one's intentions, by means of an advertisement in one's own name; one _makes known_ a fact through a circuitous channel and without any name.  
To _inform_ may be done either personally or otherwise; to _acquaint_ and _apprise_ are immediate and personal communications. One _informs_ the government, or any public body, or one _informs_ one's friends; one _acquaints_ (for derivation see [acquaintance](entry://acquaintance)) or _apprises_ (from Old French _aprise_, instruction, compounded of Latin _ad_, and the past participle of _prehendere_, to seize, to take, signifying to take information to another) only one's friends or particular individuals: one is _informed_ of that which concerns either the _informant_ or the person _informed;_ one _acquaints_ a person with, or _apprises_ him of, such things as peculiarly concern himself, but the latter in more specific circumstances than the former: one _informs_ a correspondent by letter of the day on which he may expect to receive his order, or of one's own wishes with regard to an order; one _acquaints_ a father with all the circumstances that concern his son's conduct: one _apprises_ a friend of a bequest that has been made to him; one _informs_ the magistrate of any irregularity that occurs; one _acquaints_ the master of a family with the misconduct of his servants: one _apprises_ a person of the time when he will be obliged to appear.  
_Inform_ may be applied figuratively to things; the other terms to persons only in the proper sense.  
**INFORM, INSTRUCT, TEACH.** — The communication of knowledge in general is the common idea by which these words are connected with one another. _Inform_ is here, as in the preceding article, the general term; the other two are specific terms. To _inform_ is the act of persons in all conditions; to _instruct_ and _teach_ are the acts of superiors, either on one ground or another: one _informs_ by virtue of an accidental superiority or priority of knowledge; one _instructs_ by virtue of superior knowledge or superior station; one _teaches_ (Anglo-Saxon _tœcan_, to show how to do, from the root found in English _token)_ by virtue of superior knowledge rather than of station: diplomatic agents _inform_ their governments of the political transactions in which they have been concerned; government _instructs_ (Latin _in_ and _structus_, past participle of _struere_, to build up) its different functionaries and officers in regard to their mode of proceeding; professors and preceptors _teach_ those who attend public schools to learn. To _inform_ is applicable to matters of general interest: we may _inform_ ourselves or others on anything which is a subject of inquiry or curiosity, and the _information_ serves either to amuse or to improve the mind: to _instruct_ is applicable to matters of serious concern, or to that which is practically useful; a parent _instructs_ his child in the course of conduct he should pursue: to _teach_ regards matters of art and science; the learner depends upon the _teacher_ for the formation of his mind and the establishment of his principles.  
To _inform_ and to _teach_ are employed for things as well as persons; to _instruct_ only for persons: books and reading _inform_ the mind; history or experience _teaches_ mankind.  
**INFORMANT, INFORMER.** — These two epithets, from the verb to inform, have acquired by their application an important distinction, the _informant_ being he who informs for the benefit of others, and the _informer_ to the injury of others. What the _informant_ communicates is for the benefit of the individual, and what the _informer_ communicates is for the benefit of the whole. The _informant_ is thanked for his civility in making the communication; the _informer_ undergoes a great deal of odium, but is thanked by no one, not even by those who employ him. We may all be _informants_ in our turn, if we know of anything of which another may be informed; but none are _informers_ who do not inform against the transgressors of any law.  
See also [attache](entry://attache).  
**INFORMATION, INTELLIGENCE, NOTICE, ADVICE.** — _Information_ signifies the thing of which one is informed: _intelligence_, from the Latin _intellegere_ (from _inter_, between, and _legere_, to choose, signifying to choose between, hence to discern or understand), indicates that by which one is made to understand: _notice_, from the Latin _notitia_, is that which brings a circumstance to our knowledge: _advice_ (see **admonition** under [admonish](entry://admonish)) signifies that which is made known. These terms come very near to each other in signification, but differ in application: _information_ is the most general and indefinite of all; the three others are but modes of _information._ Whatever is communicated to us is _information_, be it public or private, open or concealed: _notice, intelligence_, and _advice_ are mostly public, but particularly the former. _Information_ and _notice_ may be communicated by word of mouth or by writing; _intelligence_ is mostly communicated by writing or printing; _advices_ are mostly sent by letter: _information_ is mostly an informal mode of communication; _notice, intelligence_, and _advice_ are mostly formal communications. A servant gives his master _information_, or one friend sends another _information_ from the country; magistrates or officers give _notice_ of such things as it concerns the public to know and to observe; spies give _intelligence_ of all that passes under their notice; or _intelligence_ is given in the public prints of all that passes worthy of notice: a military commander sends _advice_ to his government of the operations which are going forward under his direction; or one merchant gives _advice_ to another of the state of the market. _Intelligence_, as the first intimation of an interesting event, ought to be early; _advices_, as entering into details, ought to be clear and particular; official _advices_ often arrive to contradict non-official _intelligence. Information_ and _intelligence_, when applied as characteristics of men, have a further distinction: the man of _information_ is so denominated only on account of his knowledge; but a man of _intelligence_ is so denominated on account of his understanding as well as experience and information. It is not possible to be _intelligent_ without _information;_ but we may be well _informed_ without being remarkable for _intelligence:_ a man of _information_ may be an agreeable companion, and fitted to maintain conversation: but an _intelligent_ man will be an instructive companion, and most fitted for conducting business. 

####infraction 
See [infringe](entry://infringe)

####infringe 
**INFRINGE, VIOLATE, TRANSGRESS.**  
_Infringe_, from Latin _infringere, frangere_, to break, signifies to break into. _Violate_, from a hypothetical adjective based on the Latin _vis_, force, signifies to break with force. _Transgress_, from _trans_, across, and _gredi_ (past participle _gressus)_, to step, signifies to go beyond, or farther than we ought.  
Civil and moral laws and rights are _infringed_ by those who act in opposition to them: treaties and engagements are _violated_ by those who do not hold them sacred: the bounds which are prescribed by the moral law are _transgressed_ by those who are guilty of any excess. It is the business of government to see that the rights and privileges of individuals or particular bodies be not _infringed;_ policy but too frequently runs counter to equity; where the particular interests of states are more regarded than the dictates of conscience, treaties and compacts are _violated:_ the passions, when not kept under proper control, will ever hurry on men to _transgress_ the limits of right reason.  
See also [encroach](entry://encroach)  
**INFRINGEMENT, INFRACTION.** — _Infringement_ and _infraction_, which are both derived from the Latin verb _infringo_ or _frango_, are employed according to the different senses of the verb _infringe_, the former being applied to the rights of individuals, either in their domestic or public capacity, and the latter rather to national transactions. Politeness, which teaches us what is due to every man in the smallest concerns, considers any unasked-for interference in the private affairs of another as an _infringement._ Equity, which enjoins on nations as well as individuals an attentive consideration to the interests of the whole, forbids the _infraction_ of a treaty in any case. 

####infuse 
See [implant](entry://implant)

####ingenuity 
**INGENUITY, WIT.**  
_Ingenuity_ (see [ingenuous](entry://ingenuous)). _Wit_, from the Anglo-Saxon _witt_, knowledge, German _wissen_, to know, signifies knowledge or understanding.  
Both these terms imply acuteness of understanding, and differ mostly in its mode of displaying itself. _Ingenuity_ comprehends invention; _wit_ is the fruit of the imagination, which forms new and sudden conceptions of things. One is _ingenious_ in matters either of art or science; one is _witty_ only in matters of sentiment: things may, therefore, be _ingenious_, but not _witty;_ or _witty_, but not _ingenious;_ or both _witty_ and _ingenious._ A mechanical invention, or any ordinary contrivance, is _ingenious_, but not _witty:_ we say, an _ingenious_, not a _witty_ solution of a difficulty; a flash of _wit_, not a flash of _ingenuity:_ a _witty_ humor, a _witty_ conversation, not an _ingenious_ humor or conversation: on the other hand, a thought is _ingenious_, as it displays acuteness of intellect and aptness to the subject; it is _witty_, inasmuch as it contains point and strikes on the understanding of others. _Ingenuity_ is expressed by means of words or shows itself in the act; mechanical contrivances display _ingenuity: wit_ can be only expressed by words; some men are happy in the display of their _wit_ in conversation.  
Sometimes the word _wit_ is applied to the operations of the intellect generally, which brings it still nearer in sense to _ingenuity_, but in this case it always implies a quick and sharp intellect as compared with _ingenuity_, which may be the result of long thought or be employed on graver matters. 

####ingenuous 
**INGENUOUS, INGENIOUS.**  
It would not have been necessary to point out the distinction between these two words if they had not been confounded in writing as well as in speaking. _Ingenuous_, in Latin _ingenuus_, and _ingenious_, in Latin _ingeniosus_, are, either immediately or remotely, both derived from _ingignere_, to be inborn; but the former regards the freedom of the station and consequent nobility of the character which is inborn: the latter regards the genius or mental powers which are inborn. Truth is coupled with freedom or nobility of birth; the _ingenuous_, therefore, bespeaks the inborn freedom, by asserting the noblest right, and following the noblest impulse, of human nature, namely, that of speaking the truth; _genius_ is altogether a natural endowment, that is, born with us, independent of external circumstances; the _ingenious_ man, therefore, displays his powers as occasion may offer. We love the _ingenuous_ character on account of the qualities of his heart; we admire the _ingenious_ man on account of the endowments of his mind. One is _ingenuous_ as a man or _ingenious_ as an author: a man confesses an action _ingenuously;_ he defends it _ingeniously._

####inherent 
**INHERENT, INBRED, INBORN, INNATE.**  
The _inherent_, from _hœreo_, to stick, denotes a permanent quality or property, as opposed to that which is adventitious and transitory. _Inbred_ denotes that which is derived principally from habit or by a gradual process, as opposed to what is acquired by actual efforts. _Inborn_ denotes that which is purely natural, in opposition to the artificial. _Inherent_ is the most general in its sense; for what is _inbred_ and _inborn_ is naturally _inherent;_ but all is not _inbred_ and _inborn_ which is _inherent._ Inanimate objects have _inherent_ properties; but the _inbred_ and _inborn_ exist only in that which receives life; solidity is an _inherent_, but not an _inbred_ or _inborn_, property of matter: a love of truth is an _innate_ property of the human mind; it is consequently _inherent_, inasmuch as nothing can totally destroy it. That which is _inbred_ is bred or nurtured in us from our birth; that which is _inborn_ is simply born in us: a property may be _inborn_, but not _inbred;_ it cannot, however, be _inbred_ and not _inborn._ Habits, which are ingrafted into the natural disposition, are properly _inbred._ Propensities, on the other hand, which are totally independent of education or external circumstances, are properly _inborn_, as an _inborn_ love of freedom; hence, likewise, the properties of animals are _inbred_ in them, inasmuch as they are derived through the medium of the breed of which the parent partakes.  
_Inborn_ and _innate_, from the Latin _natus_, born, are precisely the same in meaning, yet they differ somewhat in application. Poetry and the grave style have adopted _inborn;_ philosophy has adopted _innate:_ genius is _inborn_ in some men; nobility is _inborn_ in others: there is an _inborn_ talent in some men to command, and an _inborn_ fitness in others to obey. Mr. Locke and his followers are pleased to say there is no such thing as _innate_ ideas: and if they mean only that there are no sensible impressions on the soul until it is acted upon by external objects they may be right: but if they mean to say that there are no _inborn_ characters or powers in the soul which predispose it for the reception of certain impressions, they contradict the experience of the learned and the unlearned in all ages, who believe, and that from close observation of themselves and others, that man has, from his birth, not only the general character which belongs to him in common with his species, but also those peculiar characteristics which distinguish individuals from their earliest infancy: all these characters or characteristics are, therefore, not supposed to be produced, but elicited, by circumstances; and ideas, which are but the sensible forms that the soul assumes in its connection with the body, are, on that account, in vulgar language termed _innate._

####injury 
**INJURY, DAMAGE, HURT, HARM, MISCHIEF.**  
All these terms are employed to denote what is done to the disadvantage of any person or thing.  
The term _injury_ (see [disadvantage](entry://disadvantage)) sometimes includes the idea of violence, or of an act done contrary to law or right, as to inflict or receive an _injury_, to redress _injuries_, etc.  
_Injury_ is often taken in the general sense of what makes a thing otherwise than it ought to be: the other terms are taken in that sense only, and denote modes of _injury. Damage_, from _damnum_, loss, and a suffix, is that _injury to_ a thing which occasions loss to a person or a diminution of value to a thing. _Hurt_ comes from Old French _hurter, to_ strike or dash against, hence to injure. Its ultimate origin is unknown; it signifies the _injury_ which destroys the soundness or integrity of things: the _harm_ (see [evil](entry://evil)) is the smallest kind of _injury_, which may simply produce inconvenience or trouble: the _mischief_ is a great _injury_, which more or less disturbs the order and consistency of things. _Injury_ is applicable to all bodies indiscriminately, physical and moral; _damage_ to physical bodies only; _hurt_ to physical bodies properly, and to moral objects figuratively. Trade may suffer an _injury_, or a building may suffer an _injury_, from time or a variety of other causes: a building, merchandise, and other things may suffer a _damage_ if they are exposed to violence.  
_Hurt_ is applied to the animal body; a sprain, a cut, or bruise are little _hurts._ It may be figuratively applied to other bodies which may suffer in a similar manner, as a _hurt_ to one's good name.  
_Harm_ and _mischief_ are as general in their application as _injury_, and comprehend what is physically as well as morally bad, but they are more particularly applicable to what is done intentionally by the person: whence ready to do _harm_ or _mischief_ is a characteristic of the individual.  
As applied to things, _harm_ and _mischief_ are that which naturally results from the object; when a thing is said to do _harm_ or _mischief_, that implies that it is its property.

####injustice 
**INJUSTICE, INJURY, WRONG.**  
_Injustice_ (see [justice](entry://justice)), _injury_ (see [disadvantage](entry://disadvantage)), and _wrong_, from Late Anglo-Saxon _wrang_, cognate with _wring_, meaning a hurt resulting from crushing or wringing, are all opposed to the right; but the _injustice_ lies in the principle, the _injury_ in the action that _injures._ There may, therefore, be _injustice_ where there is no specific _injury;_ and, on the other hand, there may be _injury_ where there is no _injustice._ When we think worse of a person than we ought to think, we do him an act of _injustice;_ but we do not, in the strict sense of the word, do him an _injury:_ on the other hand, if we say anything to the discredit of another, it will be an _injury_ to his reputation if it be believed; but it may not be an _injustice_, if it be strictly conformable to truth, and that which one is compelled to say.  
The violation of justice, or a breach of the rule of right, constitutes the _in justice;_ but the quantum of ill which falls on the person constitutes the _injury._ Sometimes a person is dispossessed of his property by fraud or violence; this is an act of _injustice;_ but it is not an _injury_ if, in consequence of this act, he obtains friends who make it good to him beyond what he has lost: on the other hand, a person suffers very much through another's inadvertency, which to him is a serious _injury_, although the offender has not been guilty of _injustice._  
A _wrong_ partakes both of _injustice_ and _injury;_ it is, in fact, an _injury_ done by one person to another in express violation of justice. The man who seduces a woman from the path of virtue does her the greatest of all _wrongs._ One repents of _injustice_, repairs _injuries_, and redresses _wrongs._

####inside 
**INSIDE, INTERIOR.**  
The term _inside_ may be applied to bodies of any magnitude, small or large; _interior_ is peculiarly appropriate to bodies of great magnitude. We may speak of the _inside_ of a nutshell, but not of its _interior:_ on the other hand, we speak of the _interior_ of St. Paul's or the _interior_ of a palace. This difference of application is not altogether arbitrary: for _inside_ literally signifies the side that is inward; but _interior_ signifies the space which is more inward than the rest, which is enclosed in an enclosure, consequently cannot be applied to anything but a large space that is enclosed. 

####insidious 
**INSIDIOUS, TREACHEROUS.**  
_Insidious_, in Latin _insidiosus_, from _insidiœ_, stratagem or ambush (from _insidere_, to lie in wait or ambush, from _in_, in, and _sedere_, to sit), signifies as much as lying in wait. _Treacherous_ is derived through Old French _trecherie_ from Late Latin _triccare_, based on Latin _tricœ,_ wiles, difficulties, by which the English _trick_ may also be influenced, and signifies the disposition to deceive, to overcome by wiles.  
The _insidious_ man is not so active as the _treacherous_ man; the former only lies in wait to insnare us when we are off our guard; the latter throws us off our guard by lulling us into a state of security, to get us more effectually into his power: an enemy may be denominated _insidious_, but a friend is _treacherous._ He who is afraid of avowing his real sentiments on religion makes _insidious_ attacks either on its ministers, its doctrines, or its ceremonies: he who is most in the confidence of another is capable of being the most _treacherous_ toward him.

####insight 
**INSIGHT, INSPECTION.**  
The _insight_ into a thing is what we receive: the _inspection_ is what we give: one gets a view into a thing by an _insight;_ one takes a view over a thing by an _inspection._ An _insight_ serves to increase our own knowledge; _inspection_ enables us to instruct or direct others. An inquisitive traveller tries to get an _insight_ into the manners, customs, laws, and government of the countries which he visits; by _inspection_ a master discovers the errors which are committed by his scholars, and sets them right. 

####insignificant

####insinuate 
**INSINUATE, INGRATIATE.**  
_Insinuate_ (see [hint](entry://hint)) and _ingratiate_, from _gratus_, grateful or acceptable, are employed to express an endeavor to gain favor; but they differ in the circumstances of the action. A person who _insinuates_ adopts every art to steal into the good-will of another; but he who _ingratiates_ adopts unartificial means to conciliate good-will. A person of _insinuating_ manners wins upon another imperceptibly, even so as to convert dislike into attachment; a person with _ingratiating_ manners procures good-will by manifest efforts. _Insinuate_ and _ingratiate_ may differ in the motive, as well as the mode, of the action: the motive is, in both cases, self-interest; but the former is unlawful, and the latter allowable. In proportion as the object to be attained by another's favor is base, so is it necessary to have recourse to _insinuation;_ when the object to be attained is that which may be avowed, _ingratiating_ will serve the purpose. Low persons _insinuate_ themselves into the favor of their superiors, in order to obtain an influence over them: it is commendable in a young person to wish to _ingratiate_ himself with those who are entitled to his esteem and respect. In modern use, however, _ingratiate_ clearly has begun to assume somewhat the same unfavorable connotation of _insinuate. Insinuate_ may be used in the improper sense for unconscious agents; _ingratiate_ is always the act of a conscious agent. Water will _insinuate_ itself into every body that is in the smallest degree porous; there are few persons of so much apathy that it may not be possible, one way or another, to _ingratiate_ one's self into their favor.  
**INSINUATION, REFLECTION.** — These both imply personal remarks, or such remarks as are directed toward an individual; but the former is less direct and. more covert than the latter. An _insinuation_ always deals in half-words; a _reflection_ is commonly open. They are both levelled at the individual with no good intent; but the _insinuation_ is general, and may be employed to convey any unfavorable sentiment; the _reflection_ is particular, and commonly passes between intimates and persons in close connection. The _insinuation_ concerns the honor, the moral character, or the intellectual endowments of the person: the _reflection_ respects his particular conduct or feelings toward another. Envious people throw out _insinuations_ to the disparagement of those whose merits they dare not openly question; when friends quarrel they deal largely in _reflections_ on the past. 

####insipid 
**INSIPID, DULL, FLAT.**  
_Insipid_, in Latin _insipidus_, from _in_, privative, and _sapere_, to taste, signifies without savor. _Dull_ (see [dull](entry://dull)). _Flat_ (see [flat](entry://flat)).  
A want of spirit in the moral sense is designated by these epithets, which borrow their figurative meaning from different properties in nature: the taste is referred to in the word _insipid;_ the properties of colors are considered under the word _dull;_ the property of surface is referred to by the word _flat._ As the want of flavor in any meat makes it _insipid_ and renders it worthless, so does the want of mind or character in a man render him equally _insipid_ and devoid of the distinguishing characteristic of his nature: as the beauty and perfection of colors consist in their brightness, the absence of this essential property, which constitutes _dulness_, renders them uninteresting objects to the eye; so the want of spirit in a moral composition, which constitutes its _dulness_, deprives it at the same time of that ingredient which should awaken attention: as in the natural world objects are either elevated or _flat_, so in the moral world the spirits are either raised or depressed, and such moral representations as are calculated to raise the spirits are termed spirited, while those which fail in this object are termed _flat._ An _insipid_, writer is without sentiment of any kind or degree; a _dull_ writer fails in vivacity and vigor of sentiment; a _flat_ performance is wanting in the property of provoking mirth, which should be its peculiar ingredient. 

####insist 
**INSIST, PERSIST.**  
Both these terms being derived from the Latin _sisto_, to stand, express the idea of resting or keeping to a thing; but _insist_ signifies to rest on a point, and _persist_, from _per_, through or by, and _sisto_ (see **continue** under [continual](entry://continual)), signifies to keep on with a thing, to carry it through. We _insist_ on a matter by maintaining it; we _persist_ in a thing by continuing to do it: we _insist_ by the force of authority or argument; we _persist_ by the mere act of the will. A person _insists_ on that which he conceives to be his right: or he _insists_ on that which he conceives to be right: but he _persists_ in that which he has no will to give up. To _insist_ is, therefore, an act of discretion; to _persist_ is mostly an act of folly or caprice: the former is always taken in a good or indifferent sense; the latter mostly in a bad sense. A parent ought to _insist_ on all matters that are of essential importance to his children; a spoiled child _persists_ in its follies from perversity of humor. 

####insnare 
**INSNARE, ENTRAP, ENTANGLE, INVEIGLE.**  
The idea of getting any object artfully into one's power is common to all these terms: to _insnare_ is to take in, or by means of, a _snare_, from Anglo-Saxon _sneare_, a cord, string, or noose; to _entrap_ is to take in a _trap_, from Anglo-Saxon _treppe_, a step, a _trap_ being a contrivance into which an animal steps — allied to _tramp;_ to _entangle_ is to take in a _tangle_, which is a Scandinavian word, a frequentative of _tang_, sea-weed, and means to twist around and around like sea-weed; to _inveigle_, or to take by means of malting blind, is a vitiation of the French _aveugle_, blind, from Latin 06, without, and _oculum_, eye.  
_Insnare_ and _entangle_ are used either in the natural or moral sense; _entrap_ mostly in the natural, sometimes in the figurative, _inveigle_ only in the moral sense. In the natural sense birds are _insnared_ by means of bird-lime, nooses, or whatever else may deprive them of their liberty: men and beasts are _entrapped_ in whatever serves as a _trap_ or an enclosure; they may be _entrapped_ by being lured into a house or any place of confinement; all creatures are _entangled_ by nets, or that which confines the limbs and prevents them from moving forward.  
In the moral sense, men are said to be _insnared_ by their own passions and the allurements of pleasure into a course of vice which deprives them of the use of their faculties and makes them virtually captives; they are _entangled_ by their errors and imprudences in difficulties which interfere with their moral freedom and prevent them from acting. They are _inveigled_ by the artifices of others when the consequences of their own actions are shut out from their view, and they are made to walk like blind men. 

####insolent 
See [impertinent](entry://impertinent)

####insolvency 
**INSOLVENCY, FAILURE, BANKRUPTCY.**  
_Insolvency_, from Latin _in_, not, and _solvere_, to loose, to discharge one's obligations, hence to pay, signifies the state of not being able to pay. _Failure_ (see that word). _Bankruptcy_, modified etymologically from French _banqueroute_ by knowledge of the second element, from the two words _banka_ and _rupta_, signifies literally a broken bank.  
All these terms are in particular use in the mercantile world, but are not excluded also from general application.  
_Insolvency_ is a state; _failure_, an act consequent upon that state; and _bankruptcy_ is an effect of that act. _Insolvency_ is a condition of not being able to pay one's debts; _failure_ is a cessation of business, from the want of means to carry it on; and _bankruptcy_ is a legal surrender of all one's remaining goods into the hands of one's creditors, in consequence of a real or supposed _insolvency._ These terms are seldom confined to one person or description of persons. As an incapacity to pay debts is very frequent among others besides men of business, _insolvency_ is said of any such persons; a gentleman may die in a state of _insolvency_ who does not leave effects sufficient to cover all demands. Although _failure_ is here specifically taken for a _failure_ in business, yet there may be a _failure_ in one particular undertaking without any direct _insolvency:_ a _failure_ may likewise imply only a temporary _failure_ in payment, or it may imply an entire _failure_ of the concern. As a _bankruptcy_ is a legal transaction, which entirely dissolves the firm under which any business is conducted, it necessarily implies a _failure_ to the full extent of the term; yet it does not necessarily imply an _insolvency;_ for some men may, in consequence of a temporary _failure_, be led to commit an act of _bankruptcy_ who are afterward enabled to give a full dividend to all their creditors. 

####inspection 
**INSPECTION, SUPERINTENDENCY, OVERSIGHT.**  
The office of looking into the conduct of others is expressed by the first two terms, but _inspection_ comprehends little more than the preservation of good order; _superintendence_ includes the arrangement of the whole. The monitor of a school has the _inspection_ of the conduct of his school-fellows, but the master has the _superintendence_ of the school. The officers of an army _inspect_ the men, to see that they observe all the rules that have been laid down for them; a general or superior officer has the _superintendence_ of any military operation. Fidelity is peculiarly wanted in an _inspector_, judgment and experience in a _superintendent. Inspection_ is said of things as well as persons; _oversight_ only of persons; one has the _inspection_ of books in order to ascertain their accuracy; one has the _oversight_ of persons to prevent irregularity: there is an _inspector_ of the customs and an _overseer_ of the poor.

####instant 
**INSTANT, MOMENT.**  
_Instant_, from _instare_, to stand over, signifies the point of time that stands over us, or, as it were, over our heads. _Moment_, from the Latin _momentum_, from _movere_, to move, signifies properly movement, but is here taken for the small particle of time in which any movement is made.  
_Instant_ is always taken for the time present; _moment_ is taken generally for either past, present, or future. A dutiful child comes the _instant_ he is called; a prudent person embraces the favorable _moment._ When they are both taken for the present time, _instant_ expresses a much shorter space than _moment;_ when we desire a person to do a thing this _instant_, it requires haste: if we desire him to do it this _moment_, it only admits of no delay. _Instantaneous_ relief is necessary on some occasions to preserve life; a _moment's_ thought will furnish a ready wit with a suitable reply.  
**INSTANT, JIFFY.** — _Jiffy_ is a colloquial word of uncertain origin, differing in its meaning from _moment_, much as _instant_ differs, but indicating a still briefer moment of time than _instant._ It cannot, however, be employed in serious writing.

####institute 
**INSTITUTE, ESTABLISH, FOUND, ERECT.**  
To _institute_, in Latin _institutus_, participle of _institue_, from _in_ and _statuere_, to place or appoint, signifying to dispose or fix for a specific end, is to form according to a certain plan; to _establish_ (see [fix](entry://fix)) is to fix in a certain position what has been formed; to _found_ (see [found](entry://found)) is to lay the foundation of anything; to _erect_ (see [build](entry://build)) is to make _erect._ Laws, communities, and particular orders are _instituted;_ schools, colleges, and various societies are _established:_ in the former case something new is supposed to be framed; in the latter case it is supposed only to have a certain situation assigned to it. The order of the Jesuits was _instituted_ by Ignatius de Loyola; schools were _established_ by Alfred the Great in various parts of his dominions. The act of _instituting_ comprehends design and method; that of _establishing_ includes the idea of authority. The Inquisition was _instituted_ in the time of Ferdinand; the Church of England is _established_ by authority. To _institute_ is always the immediate act of some agent; to _establish_ is sometimes the effect of circumstances. Men of public spirit _institute_ that which is for the public good; a communication or trade between certain places becomes _established_ in course of time. An _institution_ is properly of a public nature, but _establishments_ are as often private: there are charitable and literary _institutions_, but domestic _establishments._  
To _found_ is a species of _instituting_ which borrows its figurative meaning from the nature of buildings and is applicable to that which is formed after the manner of a building; a public school is _founded_ when its pecuniary resources are formed into a fund or _foundation._ To _erect_ is a species of _founding_, for it expresses, in fact, a leading particular in the act of _founding:_ nothing can be _founded_ without being _erected;_ although some things may be _erected_ without being expressly _founded_ in the natural sense; a house is both _founded_ and _erected;_ a monument is _erected_, but not _founded;_ so in the figurative sense, a college is _founded_ and consequently _erected:_ but a tribunal is _erected_, not _founded._

####instrument 
**INSTRUMENT, TOOL.**  
_Instrument_, in Latin _instrumentum_, from _instruo_, signifies the thing by which an effect is produced. _Tool_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _tol_, an implement for working, signifying the thing with which one toils. These terms are both employed to express the means of producing an end. An _instrument_ is a _tool_ of delicate or elaborate mechanism. Applied figuratively to persons, _instrument_ is used mostly in a good sense, _tool_ only in a bad sense. Individuals in high stations are often the _instruments_ in bringing about great changes in nations; spies and informers are the _tools_ of government.

####insurrection 
**INSURRECTION, SEDITION, REBELLION, REVOLT.**  
_Insurrection_, from _insurrectus_, participle of _surgere_ (English _surge)_, to rise up, signifies rising up against any power that is. _Sedition_, in Latin _seditio_, compounded of _sed_, for _se_ and _itio_, signifies a going apart, that is, the people going apart from the government. _Rebellion_, from Latin _re_, against, and _bellum_, war, signifies turning upon or against, in a hostile manner, that to which one has been before bound. _Revolt_, in French _révolter_, is most probably compounded of _re_ and _volter_, from _volvere_, to roll, signifying to roll or turn back from, to turn against that to which one has been bound.  
The term _insurrection_ is general; it is used in a good or bad sense, according to the nature of the power against which one rises up: _sedition_ and _rebellion_ are more specific; they are always taken in the bad sense of unallowed opposition to lawful authority. There may be an _insurrection_ against usurped power, which is always justifiable; but _sedition_ and _rebellion_ are levelled against power universally acknowledged to be legitimate. _Insurrection_ is always open; it is a rising up of many in a mass; but it does not imply any concerted or any specifically active measure: a united spirit of opposition, as the moving cause, is all that is comprehended in the meaning of the term: _sedition_ is either secret or open, according to circumstances; in popular governments it will be open and determined; in monarchical governments it is secretly organized: _rebellion_ is the consummation of _sedition;_ the scheme of opposition which has been digested in secrecy breaks out into open hostilities and becomes _rebellion. Insurrections_ may be made by nations against a foreign dominion, or by subjects against their government: _sedition_ and _rebellion_ are carried on by subjects only against their government.  
_Revolt_, like _rebellion_, signifies originally a warring or turning against the power to which one has been subject; but _revolt_ is mostly taken either in an indifferent or a good sense for resisting a foreign dominion which has been imposed by force of arms.  
_Rebel_ and _revolt_ may be figuratively applied to the powers of the mind when opposed to each other: the will _rebels_ against the reason.

####intellect 
**INTELLECT, GENIUS, TALENT.**  
_Intellect_, in Latin _intellectus_, from _inter_, between, and the past participle of _legere_, to choose, meaning that which chooses between or judges, signifies the gift of understanding, as opposed to mere instinct or impulse. _Genius_, in Latin _genius_, from _gignere_, to be born, signifies that which is peculiarly born with us. _Talent_ (see [faculty](entry://faculty)).  
_Intellect_ is here the generic term, and includes in its meaning that of the two other terms; there cannot be _genius_ and _talent_ without _intellect_, but there may be _intellect_ without any express _genius_ or _talent. Intellect_ is the intellectual power improved and exalted by cultivation and exercise; in this sense we speak of a man of _intellect_, or a work that displays great _intellect; genius_ is the particular bent of the _intellect_ which is born with a man, as a _genius_ for poetry, painting, music, etc.; _talent_ is a particular mode of _intellect_ which qualifies its possessor to do some things better than others, as a _talent_ for learning languages, a _talent_ for the stage, etc.

####intent 
**INTENT, INTENSE.**  
_Intent_ and _intense_ are both derived from the verb to _intend_, Latin _intendere_, signifying to stretch toward a point or to a great degree: the former is said only of the person or mind; the latter qualifies things in general: a person is _intent_ when his mind is on the stretch toward an object; his application is _intense_ when his mind is for a continuance I closely fixed on certain objects; cold is _intense_ when it seems to have reached its highest pitch. See also [tenor](entry://tenor)

####intercede 
**INTERCEDE, INTERPOSE, MEDIATE, INTERFERE, INTERMEDDLE.**  
_Intercede:_ from _inter_, between, and _cedere_, to go, signifies literally going between; _interpose_, through French from Latin _inter_, between, and Late Latin _pausare_, to place, means placing one's self between; _mediate_, from Latin _mediatus_, past participle of _mediare_, based on _medius_, middle, means coming in the middle; _interfere_, through French from _inter_, between, and Latin _ferire_, to strike, means striking between; and _intermeddle_, through French from Latin _inter_, between, and _misculare_ (the intercalated _d_ being an Anglo-French development, which was brought over into Middle English) (Late Latin), Latin _miscere_, to mix, signifies meddling or mixing among.  
One _intercedes_ between parties that are unequal; one _interposes_ between parties that are equal; one _intercedes_ in favor of that party which is threatened with punishment; one _interposes_ between parties that threaten each other with evil: we _intercede_ with the parent in favor of the child who has offended, in order to obtain pardon for him; one _interposes_ between two friends who are disputing to prevent them from going to extremities. One _intercedes_ by means of persuasion; it is an act of courtesy or loudness in the person between whom and him on whose behalf the intercession is made to comply; one _interposes_ by an exercise of authority; it is a matter of propriety or necessity in the parties to conform. The favorite of a monarch _intercedes_ in behalf of some criminal, that his punishment may be mitigated; the magistrates _interpose_ with their authority to prevent the broils of the disorderly from coming to serious acts of violence.  
To _intercede_ and _interpose_ are employed on the highest and lowest occasions; to _mediate_ is never employed but in matters of the greatest moment. As earthly offenders, we require the _intercession_ of a fellow-mortal; as offenders against the God of heaven, we require the _intercession_ of a Divine Being: without the timely _interposition_ of a superior, trifling disputes may grow into bloody quarrels; without the _interposition_ of Divine Providence, we cannot conceive of anything important as taking place: to settle the affairs of nations, _mediators_ may afford a salutary assistance; to bring about the redemption of a lost world, the Son of God condescended to be _Mediator._  
All these acts are performed for the good of others; but _interfere_ and _intermeddle_ are of a different description: one may _interfere_ for the good of others or to gratify one's self; one never _intermeddles_ but for selfish purposes: the first three terms are, therefore, always used in a good sense; the fourth in a good or bad sense, according to circumstances; the last always in a bad sense. 

####interchange 
**INTERCHANGE, EXCHANGE, RECIPROCITY.**  
_Interchange_ is a frequent and mutual _exchange_ (see [change](entry://change)); _exchange_ consists of one act only; an _interchange_ consists of many acts: an _interchange_ is used only in the moral sense; _exchange_ is used mostly in the proper sense: an _interchange_ of civilities keeps alive good-will; an _exchange_ of commodities is a convenient mode of trade.  
_Interchange_ is an act; _reciprocity_ is an abstract property: by an _interchange_ of sentiment, friendships are engendered; the _reciprocity_ of good services is what renders them doubly acceptable to those who do them and to those who receive them. 

####intercourse 
**INTERCOURSE, COMMUNICATION, CONNECTION, COMMERCE.**  
_Intercourse_, through French, from Latin _intercursus_, signifies, literally, a running between. _Communication_ (see [communicate](entry://communicate)). _Connection_ (see [connect](entry://connect)). _Commerce_, from _cum_, and _merces_, merchandise, signifies, literally, an exchange of merchandise, and generally an interchange.  
_Intercourse_ and _commerce_ subsist only between persons; _communication_ and _connection_ between persons and things. An _intercourse_ with persons may be carried on in various forms; either by an interchange of civilities, which is a friendly _intercourse;_ an exchange of commodities, which is a _commercial intercourse;_ or an exchange of words, which is a verbal and partial _intercourse:_ a _communication_, in this sense, is a species of _intercourse_, namely, that which consists in the _communication_ of one's thoughts to another, which may subsist between man and man or between man and his Maker.  
A _connection_ consists of a permanent _intercourse;_ since one who has a regular _intercourse_ for purposes of trade with another is said to have a _connection_ with him, or to stand in _connection_ with him. There may, therefore, be a partial _intercourse_ or _communication_ where there is no _connection_, nothing to bind or link the parties to each other: but there cannot be a _connection_ which is not kept up by continued _intercourse._  
The _commerce_ is a species of general but close _intercourse;_ it may consist either of frequent meeting and regular co-operation or in cohabitation: in this sense we speak of the _commerce_ of men one with another, or the _commerce_ of man and wife, of parents and children, and the like.  
As it regards things, _communication_ is said of places in the proper sense; _connection_ is used for things in the proper or improper sense: there is said to be a _communication_ between two rooms when there is a passage open from one to the other; one house has a _connection_ with another when there is a common passage or thoroughfare to them: a _communication_ is kept up between two countries by means of regular or irregular conveyances; a _connection_ subsists between two towns when the inhabitants trade with one another, intermarry, and the like.

####interest 
**INTEREST, CONCERN.**  
The _interest_ (from the Latin _interesse_, to be among, or have a part or a share in a thing) is more comprehensive than _concern_ (see [affair](entry://affair)). We have an _interest_ in whatever touches or comes near to our feelings or our external circumstances; we have a _concern_ in that which demands our attention. _Interest_ is that which is agreeable; it consists of either profit, advantage, gain, or amusement; it binds us to an object and makes us think of it: _concern_, on the other hand, is something involuntary or painful; we have a _concern_ in that which we are obliged to look to, which we are bound to from the fear of losing or of suffering. It is the _interest_ of every man to cultivate a philosophical temper: it is the _concern_ of all to be on their guard against temptation.

####intermediate 
**INTERMEDIATE, INTERVENING.**  
_Intermediate_ signifies being in the midst, between two objects; _intervening_ signifies coming between: the former is applicable to space and time; the latter either to time or circumstances. The _intermediate_ time between the commencement and the termination of a truce is occupied with preparations for the renewal of hostilities; _intervening_ circumstances sometimes change the views of the belligerent parties, and dispose their minds to peace.

####intern 
**INTERN, CONFINE, INTERNE.**  
_Intern_, in French _interne_, from Latin _internus_, inward, from _inter_, within, between, and suffix _-nus_, Italian and Spanish _interne. Intern_, as a substantive, signifies a student residing at a school, a boarder; in the more common form, _interne_, a physician or surgeon living at a hospital or similar institution, in distinction from a visiting or consulting physician or surgeon; also, in war-times, to a person or a vessel detained at an appointed place, without permission to leave. _Intern_, as a verb, signifies to send and _confine_ in the interior of a country. Prisoners of war are _interned_ at places more or less remote from the field of action, and captured war-ships and some other vessels are _interned_ also at a distance from home ports. The former are usually held till exchanged, the latter till the close of the war. In the summer of 1915 there were about seventy Teutonic vessels of all kinds _interned_ in the ports of the United States, because of the European war.

####interval 
**INTERVAL, RESPITE.**  
_Interval_, in Latin _intervallum_, signifies, literally, the space between the stakes which formed a Roman intrenchment; and, by an extended application, it signifies any space. _Respite_, Old French _respit_, comes from Latin _respectum._ It referred originally to the "respect had to a suit on the part of a judge, " and so meant a delay, a reprieve.  
Every _respite_ requires an _interval;_ but there are many _intervals_ where there is no _respite._ The term _interval_ concerns time only; _respite_ includes the idea of ceasing from action for a time; _intervals_ of ease are a _respite_ to one who is oppressed with labor; the _interval_ which is sometimes granted to a criminal before his execution is in the most proper sense a _respite._

####intervention 
**INTERVENTION, INTERPOSITION.**  
The _intervention_, from _inter_, between, and the past participle of _venio_, to come, is said of inanimate objects; the _interposition_, from _inter_, between, and _positus_, past participle of _pono_, to place, is said only of rational agents. The light of the moon is obstructed by the _intervention_ of the clouds; the life of an individual is preserved by the _interposition_ of a superior: human life is so full of contingencies that when we have formed our projects we can never say what may _intervene_ to prevent their execution; when a man is engaged in an unequal combat, he has no chance of escaping but by the timely _interposition_ of one who is able to rescue him.

####intoxication 
**INTOXICATION, DRUNKENNESS, INFATUATION.**  
_Intoxication_, from the Latin _toxicum_ (Greek _τοξικόν_, a poison for arrows, from _τόξα_, arrows), signifies the state of being imbued with a poison. _Drunkenness_ signifies the state of having drunk overmuch. _Infatuation_, from _fatuus_, foolish, signifies making foolish, or the state of being made foolish.  
_Intoxication_ and _drunkenness_ are used either in the proper or the improper sense; _infatuation_ in the improper sense only; _intoxication_ is a general state; _drunkenness_ a particular state; _intoxication_ may be produced by various causes; _drunkenness_ is produced only by an immoderate indulgence in some _intoxicating_ liquor: a person may be _intoxicated_ by the smell of strong liquors, or by vapors which produce a similar effect; he becomes _drunken_ by the drinking of wine or other spirits. In another sense, a deprivation of one's reasoning faculties is the common idea in the signification of all these terms: _intoxication_ and _drunkenness_ spring from the intemperate state of the feelings; _infatuation_ springs from the ascendency of the passions over the reasoning powers: a person is _intoxicated_ with success, _drunk_ with joy, _infatuated_ by an excess of vanity, an impetuosity of character, or a passion for one of the opposite sex. 

####intransigent 
**INTRANSIGENT, COMMUNIST, NIHILIST, SOCIALIST.**  
_Intransigent_, in French _intransigeant_ and Spanish _intransigente_, is a compound of the Latin _in_, not, and _transigo_, to agree or settle, and implies a person who is dissatisfied with present conditions, especially of a social character, and who refuses to come to an agreement with others on questions of public interest. These terms form a part of a considerable number of designations having a common import, yet conveying different impressions according to conditions in the countries where they are most in vogue.  
An _intransigent, intransigeant_, and _intransigente_, applied to persons in France, Italy, and Spain, respectively, or an _irreconcilable_, representing at first a member of the Extreme Left in the Spanish Cortes and subsequently a member of the extreme Republican party in Spain, is one who opposes existing policies in a political, economical, and social sense.  
The _communist_ believes in the doctrine that all property should be held equally by all members of a community. The _nihilist_ of Russia believed in destroying existing institutions and governmental forms and policies, and in founding a new order of things generally. The _socialist_ of Germany, the United States, and other countries believes that society should be reconstructed on the basis of co-operation of labor and the community of property, so that there would be neither the really rich nor the really poor.  
The principles underlying these various doctrines have had earnest and eminent advocates for many years, and, as in innumerable attempts to harmonize and improve social conditions, many of the propagandists, through over-zeal, have been guilty of criminal excesses, especially in France, Italy, and Russia.  
A further exposition of movements for social betterment will be found in the article on SOCIALISM.

####intrinsic 
**INTRINSIC, REAL, GENUINE, NATIVE.**  
_Intrinsic_, in Latin _intrinsecus_, from _intra_, within, and _sequi_, to follow, signified literally following inward, that is, lying in the thing itself. _Real_, through French _réel_, or directly from Late Latin _realis_, from the Latin _res_, signifies belonging to the very thing. _Genuine_, in Latin _genuinus_, from _gignere_, to bring forth, signifies actually brought forth, or springing out of a thing. _Native_, in Latin _nativus_, and _natus_, born, signifies actually born, or arising from a thing.  
The value of a thing is either _intrinsic_ or _real:_ but the _intrinsic_ value is said in regard to its extrinsic value; the _real_ value in regard to the artificial: the _intrinsic_ value of a book is that which it will fetch when sold in a regular way, in opposition to the extrinsic value, as being the gift of a friend, a particular edition, or a particular type: the _real_ value of a book, in the proper sense, lies in the fineness of the paper and the costliness of its binding, and, in the improper sense, it lies in the excellence of its contents, in opposition to the artificial value which it acquires in the minds of bibliophiles from being a scarce edition.  
The worth of a man is either _genuine_ or _native:_ the _genuine_ worth of a man lies in the excellence of his moral character, as opposed to his adventitious worth, which he acquires from the possession of wealth, power, and dignity: his _native_ worth is that which is inborn in him, and natural, in opposition to the meretricious and borrowed worth which he may derive from his situation, his talent, or his efforts to please. 

####introduce 
**INTRODUCE, PRESENT.**  
To _introduce_, from the Latin _intra_, into, and _ducere_, to lead, signifies literally to bring within or into any place; to _present_ (see [give](entry://give)) signifies to bring into the _presence_ of. As they concern persons, the former passes between equals, the latter only among persons of rank and power: one literary man is _introduced_ to another by means of a common friend; he is _presented_ at court by means of a nobleman.  
As these terms concern things, we say that subjects are _introduced_ in the course of conversation; men's particular views upon certain subjects are _presented_ to the notice of others through the medium of publication. 

####intrude 
**INTRUDE, OBTRUDE.**  
To _intrude_ is to thrust one's self into a place; to _obtrude_, a use now practically obsolete, is to thrust one's self in the way — both from _trudere_, to thrust. _Intrude_, therefore, literally corresponds to the slang phrase _butt in._ It is _intrusion_ to go into any society unasked and undesired; it is _obtruding_ to put one's self in the way of another by joining the company and taking a part in the conversation without invitation or consent.  
An _intruder_ is unwelcome because his company is not at all desired, but an _obtruder_ may be no further unwelcome than as he occasions an interruption or disturbance.  
In the moral application they preserve the same distinction. Thoughts which we wish to banish _intrude_ sometimes on the mind; unpleasant thoughts _obtrude_ themselves to the exclusion or interruption of those we wish to retain.  
See also [encroach](entry://encroach)  
**INTRUDER, INTERLOPER.** — An _intruder_ thrusts himself in: an _interloper_ (coined from _inter_, Latin, meaning within, and Dutch _looper_, English _leap)_ runs in between and takes his station. The _intruder_, therefore, _intrudes_ only for a short space of time, and in an unimportant degree; but the _interloper_ deprives another of his essential rights and for a permanency. A man is an _intruder_ who is an unbidden guest at the table of another; he is an _interloper_ when he joins any society in such manner as to obtain its privileges without sharing its burdens. _Intruders_ are always offensive in the domestic circle: _interlopers_ in trade are always regarded with an evil eye.

####invalid 
**INVALID, PATIENT.**  
_Invalid_, in Latin _invalidus_, signifies, literally, one not strong or in good health; _patient_, from the Latin _pattens_, suffering, signifies one suffering under disease. _Invalid_ is a general, and _patient_ a particular, term; a person may be an _invalid_ without being a _patient:_ he may be a _patient_ without being an _invalid._ An _invalid_ is so denominated from his wanting the ordinary share of health and strength; but the _patient_ is one who is laboring under some bodily suffering. Old soldiers are called _invalids_ who are no longer able to bear the fatigues of warfare: but they are not necessarily _patients._ He who is under the surgeon's hands for any wound is a _patient_, but not necessarily an _invalid._

####invasion 
**INVASION, INCURSION, IRRUPTION, INROAD.**  
The idea of making a forcible entrance into a foreign territory is common to all these terms. _Invasion_, from _in_, into, and _vado_, to go, expresses merely this general idea, without any particular qualification: _incursion_, from _in_ and _cursus_, past participle of _curro_, to run, signifies a hasty and sudden _invasion: irruption_, from _in_, and _ruptus_, past participle of _rumpo_, to break, signifies a particularly violent _invasion; inroad_, from _in_ and _road_, signifying the making a road or way for one's self, implies the going farther into a country and making a longer stay than by an _incursion. Invasion_ is said of that which passes in distant lands; Alexander _invaded_ India; Hannibal crossed the Alps and made an _invasion_ into Italy: _incursion_ is said of neighboring states; the borderers on each side the Tweed used to make frequent _incursions_ into England or Scotland.  
_Invasion_ is the act of a regular army; it is a systematic military movement: _irruption_ and _inroad_ are the irregular movements of bodies of men; the former is applied particularly to uncultivated nations, and the latter, like _incursion_, to neighboring states: the Goths and Vandals made _irruptions_ into Europe; the Scotch and English used to make _inroads_ upon each other.  
These words preserve the same distinction in their figurative application. _Invade_ signifies a hostile attack, and may be applied to physical objects or to spiritual objects; as to _invade_ one's peace of mind, privileges, etc.  
_Inroad_ denotes the progress into any body of what is bad; as the _inroads_ of disease into the constitution, into the mind.

####invent 
**INVENT, FEIGN, FRAME, FABRICATE, FORGE.**  
All these terms are employed to express the production of something out of the mind, by means of its own efforts. To _invent_ (see [contrive](entry://contrive)) is the general term; the other terms imply modes of _invention_ under different circumstances. To _invent_, as distinguished from the rest, is busied in creating new forms either by means of the imagination or the reflective powers; it forms combinations either purely spiritual or those which are mechanical and physical: the poet _invents_ imagery; the philosopher _invents_ mathematical problems or mechanical instruments.  
_Invent_ is used for the production of new forms to real objects, or for the creation of unreal objects; to _feign_ is used for the creation of unreal objects ι or such as have no existence but in the mind: a play or a story is _invented_ from what passes in the world: Mohammed's religion consists of nothing but _inventions:_ the heathen poets _feigned_ all the tales and fables which constitute the mythology or history of their deities. To _frame_, that is, to make according to a frame, is a species of _invention_ which consists in the disposition as well as the combination of objects. Thespis was the _inventor_ of tragedy: Psalmanazar _framed_ an entirely new language, which he pretended to be spoken on the island of Formosa; Solon _framed_ a new set of laws for the city of Athens.  
To _invent, frame_, and _feign_ are all occasionally employed in the ordinary concerns of life, and in a bad sense; _fabricate_ is seldom, and _forge_ never used any otherwise. _Invent_ is employed for that which is the fruit of one's own mind and mostly contrary to the truth; to _feign_ is employed for that which is unreal; to _frame_ is employed for that which requires deliberation and arrangement; to _fabricate_ and _forge_ are employed for that which is absolutely false and requiring more or less exercise of the _inventive_ power. A person _invents_ a lie, and _feigns_ sorrow; _invents_ an excuse, and _feigns_ an attachment. A story is _invented_, inasmuch as it is new and not before conceived by others or occasioned by the suggestions of others; it is _framed_, inasmuch as it requires to be duly disposed in all its parts, so as to be consistent; it is _fabricated_, inasmuch as it runs in direct opposition to actual circumstances and therefore has required the skill and labor of a workman; it is _forged_ (from Old French _forge_, a work-shop, Latin _fabrica)_, inasmuch as it seems by its utter falsehood and extravagance to have caused as much severe action in the brain as what is produced by the fire in a furnace or _forge._

####invest 
**INVEST, ENDUE or ENDOW.**  
To _invest_, from _veslire_, to clothe, whence English _vestments_ is derived, signifies to clothe in anything. _Endue_ or _endow_, from the Latin _induo_, signifies to put on anything. One is _invested_ with that which is external: one is _endued_ with that which is internal. We _invest_ a person with an office or a dignity: a person is _endued_ with good qualities. To _invest_ is a real external action; but to _endue_ may be merely fictitious or mental. The king is _invested_ with supreme authority; a lover _endues_ his mistress with every earthly perfection. _Endow_ is but a variation of _endue_, and yet it seems to have acquired a distinct office: we may say that a person is _endued_ or _endowed_ with a good understanding; but as an act of the imagination _endow_ is not to be substituted for _endue:_ for we do not say that it _endows_, but _endues_ things with properties.

####invidious 
**INVIDIOUS, ENVIOUS.**  
_Invidious_, in Latin _invidiosus_, from _invidia_, or _in_, not, and _videre_, to see, signifies looking at with an evil eye: _envious is_ literally only a variation of _invidious. Invidious_, in its common acceptation, signifies causing ill-will; _envious_ signifies having ill-will. A task is _invidious_ that puts one in the way of giving offence; a look is _envious_ that is full of _envy. Invidious_ qualifies the thing; _envious_ qualifies the temper of the mind. It is _invidious_ for one author to be judge against another who has written on the same subject: a man is _envious_ when the prospect of another's happiness gives him pain. 

####invigorate

####invincible 
**INVINCIBLE, UNCONQUERABLE, INSUPERABLE, INSURMOUNTABLE.**  
_Invincible_ signifies not to be vanquished (see [conquer](entry://conquer)): _unconquerable_, not to be conquered: _insuperable_, not to be overcome: _insurmountable_, not to be surmounted. Persons or things which can withstand all force are in the strict sense _invincible;_ but as in this sense nothing created can be termed _invincible_, the term is employed to express strongly whatever can withstand human force in general: on this ground the Spaniards termed their Armada _invincible._ The qualities of the mind are termed _unconquerable_ when they are not to be won over or brought under the control of one's own reason or the judgment of another: hence obstinacy is with propriety denominated _unconquerable_ which will yield to no foreign influence. The particular disposition of the mind or turn of thinking is termed _insuperable_, inasmuch as it baffles our resolution or wishes to have it altered; an aversion is _insuperable_ which no reasoning or endeavor on our own part can overcome. Things are denominated _insurmountable_, inasmuch as they baffle one's skill or efforts to get over them or put them out of one's way: an obstacle is _insurmountable_ which in the nature of things is irremovable. Some people have an _insuperable_ antipathy to certain animals; some persons are of so modest and timid a character that the necessity of addressing strangers is with them an _insuperable_ objection to using any endeavors for their own advancement; the difficulties which Columbus had to encounter in his discovery of the New World would have appeared _insurmountable_ to any mind less determined and persevering.

####inward 
**INWARD, INTERNAL, INNER, INTERIOR.**  
_Inward_ signifies toward the inside, that is, not absolutely within: _internal_ signifies positively within: _inner_, as the comparative of _inward_, signifies more _inward;_ and _interior_, as the comparative of _internal_, signifies more _internal. Inward_ is employed more frequently to express a state than to qualify an object; _internal_ to qualify the objects: a thing is said to be turned _inward_ which forms a part of the _inside:_ it is said to be _internal_ as one of its characteristics; _inward_, as denoting the position, is indefinite; anything that is _in_ in the smallest degree is _inward;_ thus what we take in the mouth is _inward_ in distinction from that which may be applied to the lips; but that is properly _internal_ which lies in the very frame and system of the body; _inner_, which rises in degree on _inward_, is applicable to such bodies as admit of specific degrees of enclosure: thus the inner shell of a nut is that which is enclosed in the _inward:_ so likewise _interior_ is applicable to that which is capacious and has many involutions, as the _interior_ coat of the intestines.

####irrational 
**IRRATIONAL, FOOLISH, ABSURD, PREPOSTEROUS.**  
_Irrational_, compounded of _in_, not, _ratio_, reason, and a suffix, signifies contrary to reason, and is employed to express the want of the faculty itself, or a deficiency in the exercise of this faculty. _Foolish_ (see [folly](entry://folly)) signifies the perversion of this faculty. _Absurd_, from _ab_, and _surdus_, deaf, signifies that to which one would turn a deaf ear. _Preposterous_, from _pros_, before, and _posterus_, behind, signifies, literally, that side foremost which ought to be behind, which is unnatural and contrary to common sense.  
_Irrational_ is not so strong a term as _foolish:_ it is applicable more frequently to the thing than to the person, to the principle than to the practice; _foolish_, on the contrary, is commonly applicable to the person as well as the thing; to the practice rather than the principle. Scepticism, to those who have faith, is the most _irrational_ thing that exists; the human mind, from this viewpoint, is formed to believe, but not to doubt: he is, of all men, considered most _foolish_ who stakes his eternal salvation on his own fancied superiority of intelligence and illumination. _Foolish, absurd_, and _preposterous_ rise in degree: a violation of common sense is implied by them all, but they vary according to the degree of violence which is done to the understanding: _foolish_ is applied to anything, however trivial, which in the smallest degree offends our understanding: the conduct of children is therefore often _foolish_, but not _absurd_ and _preposterous_, which are said only of serious things that are opposed to our judgment: it is _absurd_ for a man to persuade another to do that which he in like circumstances would object to do himself; it is _preposterous_ for a man to expose himself to the ridicule of others and then be angry with those who will not treat him respectfully.

####irregular 
**IRREGULAR, DISORDERLY, INORDINATE, INTEMPERATE.**  
_Irregular_, that is, literally, _not regular_, maries merely the absence of a good quality; _disorderly_, that is, literally, out of order, maries the presence of a positively bad quality. What is _irregular_ may be so from the nature of the thing; what is _disorderly_ is rendered so by some external circumstance. Things are planted _irregularly_ for want of design: the best troops are apt to be _disorderly_ in a long march. _Irregular_ and _disorderly_ are taken in a moral as well as a natural sense: _inordinate_, which signifies also put out of order, is employed only in the moral sense. What is _irregular_ is, or ought to be, contrary to the rule that is established; _what_ is _disorderly_ is contrary to the order that has existed; what is _inordinate_ is contrary to the order that is prescribed; what is _intemperate_ is contrary to the temper or spirit that ought to be encouraged. Our habits will be _irregular_ which are not conformable to the laws of social society; our practices will be _disorderly_ when we follow the blind impulse of passion; our desires will be _inordinate_ when they are not under the control of reason guided by religion; our indulgences will be _intemperate_ when we consult nothing but our appetites. Young people are apt to contract _irregular_ habits if not placed under the care of discreet and sober people and made to conform to the regulations of domestic life: children are naturally prone to become _disorderly_ if not perpetually under the eye of a master: it is the lot of human beings of all ages and stations to have _inordinate_ desires, which require a constant check so as to prevent _intemperate_ conduct of any kind. 

####irreligious 
**IRRELIGIOUS, PROFANE, IMPIOUS.**  
As epithets to designate the character of the person they seem to rise in degree: _irreligious_ is negative; _profane_ and _impious_ are positive, the latter being much stronger than the former. All men who are not positively actuated by principles of religion are _irreligious; profanity_ and _impiety_ are, however, of a still more heinous nature; they consist not in the mere absence of regard for religion, but in a positive contempt of it and open outrage against its laws; the _profane_ man treats what is sacred as if it were _profane;_ what a believer holds in reverence and utters with awe is pronounced with an air of indifference or levity, and as a matter of common discourse, by a _profane_ man; he knows no difference between sacred and _profane_, but as the former may be converted into a source of scandal toward others; the _impious_ man is directly opposed to the _pious_ man; the former is filled with defiance and rebellion against his Maker, as the latter is with love and reverence.  
When applied to things, the term _irreligious_ seems to be somewhat more positively opposed to _religion;_ an _irreligious_ book is not merely one in which there is no religion, but that also which is detrimental to religion, such as sceptical or licentious writings: the epithet _profane_ in this case is not always a term of reproach, but is employed to distinguish what is temporal from that which is expressly spiritual in its nature; the history of nations is _profane_ as distinguished from the sacred history contained in the Bible: the writings of the heathens are altogether _profane_ as distinguished from the moral writings of Christians or the believers in Divine Revelation. On the other hand, when we speak of a _profane_ sentiment or a _profane_ joke, _profane_ lips, and the like, the sense is personal and reproachful; _impious_ is never applied but to what is personal, and in the very worst sense; an _impious_ thought, an _impious_ wish, or an _impious_ vow, is the fruit of an _impious_ mind.

####jabber 
**JABBER, GABBLE, MUMBLE.**  
These are all imitative words signifying methods of vocal expression. Between _jabber_ and _gabble_ there is little difference except that suggested by the sound of the words; they are both derived from _gab_, to talk, itself an imitative word which has an interesting history. They signify the utterance of rapid, inarticulate sounds. _Jabber_ is more frequently used to indicate that which is inarticulate, and suggests a greater rapidity and sharpness of utterance. Parrots and monkeys are said to _jabber;_ ducks and geese, to _gabble. Jabber_ is used especially of the sound of a foreign language; we speak of _jabbering_ French, _jabbering_ Italian, etc. _Gabble_ is contemptuously applied to the sound of any talk. _Mumble_ suggests a different type of utterance. It is a frequentative of Middle English _mum_, which signifies the least sound made with closed hps; it means, literally, to keep saying "mum, mum. "

####jagged 
**JAGGED, CLEFT, DENTICULATED, SERRATED, UNEVEN.**  
_Jagged_ is the adjective form of the substantive _jag_, a Scandinavian word signifying notch or tooth, and means notched or toothlike, signifying an uneven edge. An object that has been _cleft_ or split usually exhibits irregular or rough edges or surfaces, as a rock that has been blasted; one that has become _denticulated_ (from the Latin _denticulus_, a small tooth) displays projecting points; one that is _serrated_ (from the Latin _serro_, to saw) shows protuberances or an irregular edge, as the cutting edge of a fine saw; and whatever is _uneven_ is more or less rough or ragged on its surface or edge.  
The Sierra Madre Mountains in Mexico and the Sierra Nevada range in California are so called because they have _serrated_ or saw-tooth ridges, and a leaf and other botanical growths that have sharp, straight-edged teeth, pointing to the apex, are termed _serrated. Jag_ also has the significance of a small load, and from this is derived two American slang terms: a person who is thoroughly intoxicated is said to have a _load_ on or to be carrying a _load;_ another who is but partially intoxicated is said to have a _jag_ on. 

####jam 
See PACK 

####jangle 
**JANGLE, JAR, WRANGLE.**  
A verbal contention is expressed by all these terms, but with various modifications: _jangle_ is an imitative word of Scandinavian origin; it conveys by its own discordant sound an idea of the discordance which accompanies this kind of war of words. _Jar_ is also an imitative word, which has parallels in the various Teutonic tongues; it means to utter a harsh sound, and comes from Middle English _garren_, to chide, Anglo-Saxon _ceorian_, to murmur, etc. _Wrangle_ is a frequentative of _wring;_ its original sense was to keep twisting on or urging; hence to argue vehemently. There is in _jangling_ more of cross-questions and perverse replies than direct differences of opinion; those _jangle_ who are out of humor with one another; there is more of discordant feeling and opposition of opinion in _jarring:_ those who have no good-will to each other will be sure to _jar_ when they come into collision; and those who indulge themselves in _jarring_ will soon convert affection into ill-will. Married people may destroy the good-humor of the company by _jangling_, but they destroy their domestic peace and felicity by _jarring._ To _wrangle_ is technically what to _jangle_ is morally: those who dispute by a verbal opposition only are said to _wrangle;_ and the disputers who engage in this scholastic exercise are termed _wranglers;_ most disputations amount to little more than _wrangling._

####jealousy 
**JEALOUSY, ENVY, SUSPICION.**  
_Jealousy_ comes from Late Latin _zelosus_, full of zeal, from Greek _ζήλος_, zeal, and signifies _zealous_ for that which is one's own, and hence fearful lest some one should take it away. _Envy_, in French _envie_, Latin _invidia_, from _in-video_, compounded of _in_, privative, and _videre_, to see, signifies not looking at, or looking at in a contrary direction.  
We are _jealous_ of what is our own; we are _envious_ of what is another's. _Jealousy_ fears to lose what it has; _envy_ is pained at seeing another have that which it wants for itself. Princes are _jealous_ of their authority; subjects are _jealous_ of their rights; courtiers are _envious_ of those in favor; women are _envious_ of superior beauty.  
The _jealous_ man has an object of desire, something to get and something to retain; he does not look beyond the object that interferes with his enjoyment; a _jealous_ husband may therefore be appeased by the declaration of his wife's animosity against the object of his _jealousy._ The _envious_ man sickens at the sight of enjoyment; he is easy only in the misery of others: all endeavors, therefore, to satisfy an _envious_ man are fruitless. _Jealousy_ is a noble or an ignoble passion, according to the object; in the former case it is emulation sharpened by fear; in the latter case it is greediness stimulated by fear; _envy_ is always a base passion, drawing the worst passions in its train.  
_Jealous_ is applicable to bodies of men as well as individuals; _envious_, to the individuals only. Nations are _jealous_ of any interference on the part of any other power in their commerce, government, or territory; individuals are _envious_ of the rank, wealth, and honors of one another.  
_Suspicion_, from Latin _suspicere, sub_, under, and _specere_, to look, _i.e._, to look from under one's eyelids out of fear of being seen to look, denotes an apprehension of injury, and, like _jealousy_, implies a fear of another's intentions; but _suspicion_ has more of distrust in it than _jealousy:_ the _jealous_ man doubts neither the integrity nor the sincerity of his opponent; the _suspicious_ man is altogether fearful of the intentions of another: the _jealous_ man is _jealous_ only of him who he thinks wishes for the same thing as he does, and may rob him of it: the _suspicious_ man is _suspicious_ or fearful that be may suffer something from another. _Jealousy_ properly exists between equals or those who have a common object of desire; but _suspicion_ is directed toward any one who has the power as well as the will to hurt; rival lovers are _jealous_ of each other, but one person is _suspicious_ of another's honesty, or parties entering into a treaty may be _suspicious_ of each other's good faith. _Jealousy_ cannot subsist between a king and his people in any other than in the anomalous and unhappy case of power being the object sought for on both sides; a king may then be _jealous_ of his prerogative when he fears that it will be infringed by his people; and the people will _he jealous_ of their rights when they fear that they will be invaded by the crown. According to this distinction, _jealousy_ is erroneously substituted in the place of _suspicion. Jealousy_ is concerned only in not losing what one wishes for; _suspicion_ is afraid of incurring some positive evil.

####jest 
**JEST, JOKE, MAKE GAME, SPORT.**  
_Jest_ meant originally a story, a merry tale, from Old French _geste_, an exploit, from Latin _gesta_, past participle of _gerrere_, to wage war — a _geste_ being a tale of warlike deeds. _Joke_ is derived from Latin _iocus_, a game. To _make game_ signifies here to make the subject of game or play (see [play](entry://play)). TO _sport_ signifies here to _sport_ with or convert into a subject of amusement.  
One _jests_ in order to make others laugh; one _jokes_ in order to please one's self. The _jest_ is directed at the object; the _joke_ is practiced with the person or on the person. One attempts to make a thing laughable or ridiculous by _jesting_ about it, or treating it in a _jesting_ manner; one attempts to excite good-humor in others, or indulge it in one's self, by _joking_ with them. _Jests_ are therefore seldom harmless: _jokes axe_ frequently allowable. The most serious subject may be degraded by being turned into a _jest;_ but melancholy or dejection of the mind may be conveniently dispelled by a _joke._ Court fools and buffoons used formerly to turn their _jests_ upon every subject by which they thought to entertain their employers: those who know how to _joke_ with good-nature and discretion may contribute to the mirth of the company: to _make game_ of is applicable only to persons: to make a _sport_ of or _sport_ with is applied to objects in general, whether persons or things; both are employed, like _jest_, in the bad sense of treating a thing more lightly than it deserves.

####journey 
**JOURNEY, TRAVEL, VOYAGE.**  
_Journey_, through the French _journée_, a day's work, from Latin _diurnata_, the feminine past participle of Late Latin _diurnare_, to sojourn, based on _diurnus_, daily, signifies the course that is taken in the space of a day, or in general any comparatively short passage from one place to another. _Travel_ is the same word as _travail_, to labor; it may be derived from Late Latin _trepalium_, a kind of rack for torturing martyrs made of three beams — ires _pali. Voyage_ is derived through French from Latin _viaticum_, provisions for a journey, based on _via_, a way, and originally signified any course or passage to a distance, but is now confined to passages by sea.  
We take _journeys_ in different counties in England; we make a _voyage_ to the Indies, and _travel_ over the continent. _Journeys_ are taken for domestic business; _travels_ are made for amusement or information: _voyages_ are made by captains or merchants for purposes of commerce. We estimate _journeys_ by the day, as one or two days' _journey;_ we estimate _travels_ and _voyages_ by the months and years that are employed. The Israelites are said to have _journeyed_ in the wilderness forty years, because they went but short distances at a time. It is a part of polite education for young men of fortune to _travel_ into those countries of Europe which comprehend the grand tour, as it is termed. A _voyage_ round the world, which was at first a formidable undertaking, has now become familiar to the mind by its frequency.

####joy 
**JOY, GLADNESS, MIRTH.**  
The happy condition of the soul is designated by all these terms; _but joy_, from the Latin _gaudia_, joys, and _gladness_ (see [glad](entry://glad)) he more internally; _mirth_ (see [festivity](entry://festivity)) is the more immediate result of external circumstances. What creates _joy_ and _gladness_ is of a permanent nature; that which creates _mirth_ is temporary: _joy_ is the most vivid sensation in the soul; _gladness_ is the same in quality, but inferior in degree: _joy_ is awakened in the mind by the most important events in life; _gladness_ springs up in the mind on ordinary occasions: the return of the prodigal son awakened _joy_ in the heart of his father; a man feels _gladness_ at being relieved from some distress or trouble: public events of a gratifying nature produce universal _joy;_ relief from either sickness or want brings _gladness_ to an oppressed heart; he who is absorbed in his private distresses is ill prepared to partake of the _mirth_ with which he is surrounded at the festive board. _Joy_ is depicted on the countenance or expresses itself by various demonstrations: _gladness_ is a more tranquil feeling, which is enjoyed in secret and seeks no outward expression: _mirth_ displays itself in laughter, singing, and noise.

####judge 
**JUDGE, UMPIRE, ARBITER, ARBITRATOR.**  
_Judge_, through French _juge_, from Latin _judico_ and _judex_, from _jus_, right, and _dicare_, to point out, signifies one pronouncing the law or determining right. _Umpire_ is derived through Old French _nomper_, from Latin _non_, not, and _par_, equal, signifying a third man called into decide between two equals. _Arbiter_ and _arbitrator_, from _arbitrari_, to think, signify one who decides.  
_Judge_ is the generic term, the others are only species of the _judge._ The _judge_ determines in all matters disputed or undisputed; he pronounces what is law now as well as what will be law for the future; the _umpire_ and _arbiter_ are _judges_ only in particular cases that admit of dispute; there may be _judges_ in literature, in arts, and civil matters; _umpires and arbiters are judges_ only in private matters. The _judge_ pronounces, in matter of dispute, according to a written law or a prescribed rule; the _umpire_ decides in all matters of contest; and the _arbiter_ or _arbitrator_ in all matters of litigation, according to his own judgment. The _judge_ acts under the appointment of government; the _umpire_ and _arbitrator_ are appointed by individuals: the former is chosen for his skill; he adjudges the palm to the victor according to the merits of the case: the latter is chosen for his impartiality; he consults the interests of both by equalizing their claims. The office of _judge_ is one of the most honorable; an _umpire_ is of use in deciding contested merits, as the _umpire_ at the games of the Greeks; in poetry and the grave style the term may be applied to higher objects.  
The office of an _arbiter_, although not so elevated as a _judge_ in its literal sense, has often the important duty of a Christian peace-maker; and as the determinations of an _arbiter_ are controlled by no external circumstances, the term is applied to monarchs, and even to the Creator as the sovereign _Arbiter_ of the world.  
**JUDGMENT, DISCRETION, PRUDENCE.** — These terms are all employed to express the various modes of practical wisdom, which serve to regulate the conduct of men in ordinary life. _Judgment_ is that faculty which enables a person to distinguish right and wrong in general: _discretion_ and _prudence_ serve the same purpose in particular cases. _Judgment_ is conclusive; it decides by positive inference; it enables a person to discover the truth: _discretion_ is intuitive (see [discernment](entry://discernment)); it discerns or perceives what is in all probability right. _Judgment_ acts by a fixed rule; it admits of no question or variation; _discretion_ acts according to circumstances and is its own rule. _Judgment_ determines in the choice of what is good: _discretion_ sometimes only guards against error or direct mistakes; it chooses what is nearest to the truth. _Judgment_ requires knowledge and actual experience; _discretion_ requires reflection and consideration; a general exercises his _judgment_ in the disposition of his army and in the mode of attack; while he is following the rules of military art he exercises his _discretion_ in the choice of officers for different posts, in the treatment of his men, in his negotiations with the enemy, and various other measures which depend upon contingencies.  
_Discretion_ looks to the present; _prudence_, from Latin _providens_, foreseeing, calculates on the future: _discretion_ takes a wide survey of the case that offers: it looks to the moral fitness of things, as well as the consequences which may follow from them; it determines according to the real propriety of anything, as well as the ultimate advantages which it may produce: _prudence_ looks only to the good or evil which may result from things; it is, therefore, but a mode or accompaniment of _discretion;_ we must have _prudence_ when we have _discretion_, but we may have _prudence_ where there is no occasion for _discretion._ Those who have the conduct or direction of others require _discretion;_ those who have the management of their own concerns require _prudence._ For want of _discretion_ the master of a school or the general of an army may lose his authority: for want of _prudence_ the merchant may involve himself in ruin, or the man of fortune may be brought to beggary.  
As epithets, _judicious_ is applied to things oftener than to persons; _discreet_ is applied to persons rather than to things; _prudent_ is applied to both: a remark or a military movement is _judicious;_ it displays the _judgment_ of the individual from whom they emanate; a matron is _discreet_ who, by dint of years, experience, and long reflection, is enabled to determine on what is befitting a given case; a person is _prudent_ who does not inconsiderately expose himself to danger; a measure is _prudent_ that guards against the chances of evil. Counsels will be _injudicious_ which are given by those who are ignorant of the subject: it is dangerous to intrust a secret to one who is _indiscreet:_ the impetuosity of youth naturally impels them to be _imprudent;_ an _imprudent_ marriage is seldom followed by _prudent_ conduct in the parties who have involved themselves in it.

####juggle 
**JUGGLE, CONJURE.**  
_Juggle_, based on Old French _jugleor_, juggler, Modern French _jongleur_, a story-teller or conjuror, and _joculari_, to jest, from _joculus_, a little jest, signifies, as a substantive, an imposition, deception, trick, and as a transitive, to deceive by artifice, to play tricks or amuse by feats of legerdemain. _Conjure_, from Latin _con_, together, and _jurare_, to swear, signifies to produce an apparently magical effect by the pronouncing of mysterious words which seem to have a supernatural power. _Juggle_ and _conjure_ produce similar effects by different means. To _juggle_ implies almost supernatural skill of hand or mind; to _conjure_ implies the help of supernatural powers. The magic is within the _juggler_ himself; it is external to the _conjuror_, but under his control.

####jumble 
**JUMBLE, HUDDLE.**  
_Jumble_ and _huddle_ both imply a state of confusion and disorder. _Jumble_ is a Scandinavian word — a frequentative of _jump_, and signifies to keep making things _jump_ together so that they interfere with each other, and become inextricably confused. _Huddle_ is a frequentative allied to Middle English _huden_, to hide, and partly influenced by the Dutch _hoetelen_, to do a thing clumsily; it suggests a number of things carelessly crowded together under a cover or in a hiding-place. _Jumble_ suggests a more positive state of confusion than _huddle._ Things _huddled_ are crowded close together without an attempt at adjustment, but without necessarily interfering with each other or losing their separate identities. Things _jumbled_ together are so crowded that the parts of one are mixed with the parts of others, and the result is disorganizing confusion.

####justice 
**JUSTICE, EQUITY.**  
_Justice_, based on _ius_, right, is founded on the laws oil society: _equity_, from _œquitas_, fairness, rightness, and equality, is founded on the laws of nature. _Justice_ is a written or prescribed law, to which one is bound to conform and make it the rule of one's decisions: _equity_ is a law in our hearts; it conforms to no rule, but to circumstances, and decides by the consciousness of right and wrong. The proper object of _justice_ is to secure property; the proper object of _equity_ is to secure the rights of humanity. _Justice_ is exclusive; it assigns to every one his own; it preserves the existing inequality between men: _equity_ is communicative; it seeks to _equalize_ the condition of men by a fair distribution. _Justice_ forbids us doing wrong to any one, and requires us to repair the wrongs we have done to others: _equity_ forbids us doing to others what we would not have them do to us; it requires us to do to others what in similar circumstances we would expect from them. 

####justify

####justness 
**JUSTNESS, CORRECTNESS.**  
_Justness_, from _jus_, law, is the conformity to established principle: _correctness_, from _rectus_, right or straight (see [correct](entry://correct)), is the conformity to a certain mark or line: the former is used in the moral or improper sense only; the latter is used in the proper or improper sense. We estimate the value of remarks by their _justness_, that is, their accordance to certain admitted principles. _Correctness_ of outline is of the first importance in drawing; _correctness_ of dates enhances the value of a history. It has been _justly_ observed by the moralists of antiquity that money is the root of all evil; partisans seldom state _correctly_ what they see and hear.

####keep 
**KEEP, PRESERVE, SAVE.**  
The idea of having in one's possession is common to all these terms; it is, however, the simple meaning of _keep_ (see [hold](entry://hold)): to _preserve_, from _prœ_, beforehand, and _servare_, to _keep_, that is, to _keep_ for future use, signifies to _keep_ with care and free from all injury; to _save_, allied to _safe_, is to _keep_ laid up in a safe place and free from destruction. Things are _kept_ at all times and under all circumstances; they are _preserved_ in circumstances of peculiar difficulty and danger; they are _saved_ in the moment in which they are threatened with destruction: things are _kept_ at pleasure; they are _preserved_ by an exertion of power; they are _saved_ by the use of extraordinary means: the shepherd _keeps_ his flock by simply watching over them; children are sometimes wonderfully _preserved_ in the midst of the greatest dangers; things are frequently _saved_, in the midst of fire, by the exertions of those present.  
**KEEP, OBSERVE, FULFIL.** — These terms are synonymous in the moral sense of abiding by and carrying into execution what is prescribed or set before one for his rule of conduct; to _keep_ is simply to have by one in such manner that it shall not depart; to _observe_, in Latin _observo_, compounded of _ob_, near, and _servare_, to _keep_, signifying to _keep_ in one's view, to fix one's attention, is to _keep_ with a steady attention: to _fulfil_ (see [accomplish](entry://accomplish)) is to _keep_ to the end or to the full intent. A day is either _kept_ or _observed:_ yet the former is not only a more familiar term, but it likewise implies a much less solemn act than the latter; one must add, therefore, the mode in which it is _kept_, by saying that it is _kept_ holy, _kept_ sacred, or _kept_ as a day of pleasure; the term _observe_, however, implies always that it is _kept_ religiously: we may _keep_, but we do not _observe_ a birthday; we _keep_ or _observe_ the Sabbath.  
To _keep_ marks simply a perseverance or continuance in a thing; a man _keeps_ his word if he does not depart from it: to _observe_ marks fidelity and consideration; we _observe_ a rule when we are careful to be guided by it; to _fulfil_ marks the perfection and consummation of that which one has _kept;_ we _fulfil_ a promise by acting in strict conformity to it.  
**KEEPING, CUSTODY.** — _Keeping_ is, as before, the general term. _Custody_ is in Latin _custodia_, from _custos_, a guardian, literally a "hider, " related to Greek _κεύθειν_, to hide. The first of these terms is, as before, the most general in its signification; the latter is more frequent in its use. The _keeping_ amounts to little more than having purposely in one's possession; but _custody_ is a particular kind of _keeping_, for the purpose of preventing an escape: inanimate objects may be in one's _keeping;_ but a prisoner, or that which is in danger of getting away, is placed in _custody:_ a person has in his _keeping_ that which he values as the property of an absent friend: the officers of justice get into their _custody_ those who have offended against the laws, or such property as I has been stolen. 

####key 
**KEY, CLUE, HINT.**  
These words represent the same idea under different metaphors. A _key_, a _clue_, and a _hint_ are all means of discovery. _Key_, from Anglo-Saxon _cœg_, is that which unlocks. _Clue_ signified originally a ball of thread, from Anglo-Saxon _cliwen;_ hence a single thread by which the ball may be unrolled or a web untangled. _Hint_ comes from Middle English _henten_, to seize; it is that upon which one seizes as a possible aid to discovery. A _clue_ is less certain than a _key;_ and a _hint_ less certain than a _clue._ If a detective has found the _key_ to a mystery, he is certain that he has succeeded in his case; if he has found a _clue_, he is hopeful, but not certain. If he has a _hint_ to work upon, he may find a definite _clue_, but he has no reason for great optimism as yet. 

####kill 
**KILL, MURDER, ASSASSINATE, SLAY or SLAUGHTER.**  
_Kill_, from Anglo-Saxon _cwelan_, to die, means to cause to die, and is related to the verb _quell. Murder_, in Anglo-Saxon _morth_, German _mord_, etc., is connected with the Latin _mors_, death. _Assassinate_, from Arabic _hashashin_, signifies to _kill_ after the manner of an _assassin_, which word probably comes from the Levant, where, in the thirteenth century, there lived a prince who was called the "Old Man of the Mountains. " He lived in a castle between Antioch and Damascus, and brought up young men, whom he fed on the intoxicating drug _hashish_ (whence _assassin)_ and trained to he in wait and _kill_ passengers. _Slay_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _slean_, to smite.  
To _kill_ is the general and indefinite term, signifying simply to take away life; to _murder_ is to _kill_ with open violence and injustice; to _assassinate_ is to _murder_ by surprise or by means of lying in wait; to _slay_ is to _kill_ in battle: to _kill_ is applicable to men, animals, and also vegetables; to _murder_ and _assassinate_ to men only; to _slay_ mostly to men, but sometimes to animals; to _slaughter_ only to animals in the proper sense, but it may be applied to men in the improper sense, when they are _killed_ like brutes, either as to the numbers or to the manner of _killing_ them. 

####kind 
**KIND, SPECIES, SORT.**  
_Kind_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _cynd_, race, indicating those united by ties of blood. _Species_, in Latin _species_, from _specere_, to behold, signifies literally the form or appearance, and in an extended sense that which comes under a particular form. _Sort_, in Latin _sors_, a lot, signifies that which constitutes a particular lot or parcel.  
_Kind_ and _species_ are both employed in their proper sense; _sort_ has been diverted from its original meaning by colloquial use: _kind_ is properly employed for animate objects, particularly for mankind, and improperly for moral objects; _species_ is a term used by philosophers, classing things according to their external or internal properties. _Kind_, as a term in vulgar use, has a less definite meaning than _species_, which serves to form the groundwork of science: we discriminate things in a loose or general manner by saying that they are of the animal or vegetable _kind;_ of the canine or feline _kind;_ but we discriminate them precisely if we say that they are a _species_ of the arbutus, of the pomegranate, of the dog, the horse, and the like. By the same rule we may speak of a _species_ of madness, a _species_ of fever, and the like; because diseases have been brought under a systematic arrangement: but on the other hand, we should speak of a _kind_ of language, a _kind_ of feeling, a _kind_ of influence; and in similar eases where a general resemblance is to be expressed.  
_Sort_ may be used for either _kind_ or _species;_ it does not necessarily imply any affinity or common property in the objects, but simple assemblage, produced, as it were, by sors, chance; hence we speak of such sort of folks or people; such _sort_ of practices; different sorts of grain; the various sorts of merchandise: and in similar cases where things are sorted or brought together, rather at the option of the person than according to the nature of the thing.  
**KINDRED, RELATIONSHIP, AFFINITY, CONSANGUINITY.** — The idea of a state in which persons are placed with regard to each other is common to all these terms, which differ principally in the nature of this state. _Kindred_ signifies that of being of the same _kin_ or _kind. Relationship_ signifies that of holding a nearer _relation_ than others (see [connect](entry://connect)). _Affinity_, from Latin _ad_, to, and _finis_, border, signifies that of coming close to each other's boundaries. _Consanguinity_, from _sanguis_, the blood, signifies that of having the same blood.  
The _kindred_ is the most general state here expressed: it may embrace all mankind or refer to particular families or communities; it depends upon possessing the common property of humanity: the philanthropist claims _kindred_ with all who are unfortunate, when it is in his power to relieve them. _Relationship_ is a state less general than _kindred_, but more extended than either _affinity_ or _consanguinity;_ it applies to particular families only, but it applies to all of the same family, whether remotely or distantly related. _Affinity_ denotes a close _relationship_, whether of an artificial or a natural _kind:_ there is an _affinity_ between the husband and the wife in consequence of the marriage tie; and there is an _affinity_ between those who descend from the same parents or relations in a direct line. _Consanguinity_ is, strictly speaking, this latter species of descent; and the term is mostly employed in all questions of law respecting descent and inheritance.

####kindness

####kinetic 
**KINETIC, ACTIVE, MOVABLE**.  
These three terms signify "pertaining to motion, " but they differ in their application. _Kinetic_, from Greek _κινέω_, I move, means "resulting from motion, " or "associated with motion, " and is a scientific term. _Kinetic_ energy, for instance, is energy resulting from motion. _Active_, from Latin _actus_, past participle of _agere_, to do or drive, and a suffix, signifies a state of motion, and further suggests motion emanating from within, not the result of force applied from without. _Movable_ means a capacity for being put in motion — suggesting that the motion is a result of an external impetus. Hence none of these terms can be substituted for the other — closely allied in their meaning as they seem to be.

####kiss 
**KISS, OSCULATION.**  
The difference between these two terms is not one of meaning, but of customary usage. _Kiss_, from Anglo-Saxon _coss_, is the familiar and homely word. It is employed in simple, sincere, emotional, or poetical expression. _Osculation_, from Latin _osculum_, a little mouth, is a self-conscious and humorous periphrasis. It may be employed in scientific writing, as when the physiologist writes that "promiscuous _osculation_ is a contributory factor in this disease"; or it may be employed by the smart journalist as a humorous substitute for the familiar Anglo-Saxon term. In this case, as in many others, the Latin furnishes the dignified and impersonal word, whose dignity, however, may be made to look like pomposity; the Anglo-Saxon furnishes the familiar and natural term. 

####kleptomania 
**KLEPTOMANIA, THIEVERY.**  
Here again the difference in meaning corresponds to a difference in derivation. _Kleptomania_ is a scientific term, from Greek _κλέπτω_, I steal, and Latin _mania_, madness. _Thievery_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _theof_, and indicates the act of taking another's property. _Thievery_ is the general and popular word and carries with it the suggestion of moral condemnation. _Kleptomania_ is a specialized scientific word, suggesting an abnormal psychological condition. _Kleptomania_ is an irresistible tendency to theft actuating people who are not tempted to it by necessitous circumstances or any obvious and natural motive, and is regarded as a form of insanity. The _thief_ steals because he wants or needs the object, or intends to exchange it for something that he wants or needs. The _kleptomaniac_ takes objects with which he may be already well provided and makes no apparent use of the stolen goods. Often he steals only a particular kind of article — an article perhaps valueless in itself or useless to him. 

####knack 
**KNACK, ADROITNESS, DEXTERITY.**  
_Knack_ is an imitative word. It meant originally (1) a snap; (2) a snap with the finger-nail; (3) a jester's trick, a piece of dexterity. _Knack_ is usually employed now to indicate a kind of skill or dexterity which does not result from practice and training, but is an accidental gift or acquirement, or the result of some unexplained trick. There is always something inexplicable about a _knack;_ it cannot be _imitated_ or reduced to rules of procedure. _Dexterity_, on the contrary, from _dexter_, the right hand, signifies ease and skill in using the hand; hence, by extension, any ease and skill in making or doing something; it may be the result of inborn gifts or of training and practice. _Dexterity_ is uniform and reliable; a _knack_ is casual and may be uncertain. _Adroitness_, from French _à droit_, Latin _ad directum_, or, in a right manner, is practically synonymous with _dexterous;_ it indicates special quickness and cleverness of action. For a further distinction between _adroit_ and _dexterous_ see [clever](entry://clever). 

####knavish 
See [dishonest](entry://dishonest)

####knell 
**KNELL, TOLL.**  
There is little difference between these two words. Both indicate the slow ringing of a bell to announce death or disaster. _Toll_ suggests by its sound a more solemn and a slower ringing. _Knell_ is also used as a substantive to indicate figuratively the death or end of anything. 

####knock

####knotty 
**KNOTTY, INTRICATE, PERPLEXING.**  
These words all indicate the quality of being difficult under the image of entangled threads, but they differ from each other in the character of the image and the concreteness and vividness with which it is suggested to the mind. A _knot_ is the interweaving of two threads at one point in such a fashion as to tie them tightly together; _knotty_ means full of _knots_, difficult to unfasten. _Intricate_, from Latin _in_ and _tricœ_, wiles or hindrances, did not originally suggest the image of interwoven threads so clearly as _perplexing_, from Latin _per_, through, and _plexus_, past participle of _plectere_, to weave, which meant woven through and through. Now _intricate_, which first meant full of hindrances, clearly suggests the physical image of interwoven threads, and _perplexing_, which first suggested the physical image, is given the more general application. _Intricate_ is an objective word; _perplexing_, a subjective word. _Intricate_ describes the external object; _perplexing_ indicates the state of mind induced by it. An _intricate_ question becomes _perplexing_ the minute some individual mind tries to solve it. _Knotty_ is also an objective word, but more obviously metaphorical than intricate, and suggesting a somewhat different image. 

####know 
**KNOW, BE ACQUAINTED WITH.**  
To _know_ is a general term; to _be acquainted with_ is particular. We may know things or persons in various ways; we may _know_ them by name only, or we may _know_ their internal properties or characters; or we may simply _know_ their figure; we may _know_ them by report, or we may _know_ them by direct intercourse: one is _acquainted with_ either a person or a thing only in a direct manner and by an immediate intercourse in one's own person. We _know_ a man to be good or bad, virtuous or vicious, by being a witness to his actions; we become _acquainted with_ him by frequently being in his company.  
_Knowledge, Science, Learning, Erudition_ — _Knowledge_ signifies the thing_ known_, from Anglo-Saxon _cnawan_, allied to Latin _noscere_, to know. _Science_, in Latin _scientia_, from _scire_, to know, has the same original meaning. _Learning_, from _learn_, signifies the thing _learned. Erudition_, in Latin _eruditio_, comes from Latin _e_ for _ex_, out, and _rudis_, rude, and signifies to bring out of a stato of rudeness or ignorance, that is, the bringing into a state of perfection.  
_Knowledge_ is a general term which simply implies the thing _known: science, learning_, and _erudition_ are modes of _knowledge_ qualified by some collateral idea: _science_ is a systematic species of _knowledge_ which consists of rule and order; _learning_ is that species of _knowledge_ which one derives from schools or through the medium of personal instruction; _erudition_ is scholastic _knowledge_ obtained by profound research: _knowledge_ admits of every possible degree, and is expressly opposed to ignorance; _science, learning_, and _erudition_ are positively high degrees of _knowledge._  
The attainment of _knowledge_ is of itself a pleasure independent of the many extrinsic advantages which it brings to every individual, according to the station of life in which he is placed; the pursuits of _science_ have a peculiar interest for men of a peculiar turn. _Learning_ is less dependent on the genius than on the will of the individual; men of moderate talents have overcome the deficiencies of nature by labor and perseverance, and have acquired such stores of _learning_ as have raised them to a respectable station in the republic of letters. Profound _erudition_ is obtained by but few; a retentive memory, a patient industry, and deep penetration are requisites for one who aspires to the title of an _erudite_ man. _Knowledge_, in the unqualified and universal sense, is not always a good; we may have a _knowledge_ of evil as well as good: _science_ is good as far as it is founded upon experience; _learning_ is more generally and practically useful to the morals of men than science: _erudition_ is always good, as is a profound _knowledge_ of what is worth knowing.

####labor 
**LABOR, TAKE PAINS or TROUBLE, USE ENDEAVOR.**  
_Labor_, in Latin _labor_, toil. To _take pains_ is to expose one's self to _pains_ (see [pain](entry://pain)); and to _take_ the _trouble_ is to impose _trouble_ on one's self (see **affliction** under [afflict](entry://afflict)). _Endeavor_ (see that word).  
The first three terms suppose the necessity for a painful exertion; but to _labor_ expresses more than to _take pains_, and this more than to _trouble:_ to _use endeavor_ excludes every idea of pain or inconvenience: great difficulties to be conquered; great perfection or correctness require _vains;_ a concern to please will give _trouble;_ but we _use endeavors_ wherever any object is to be obtained or any duty to be performed To _labor_ is either a corporeal or a mental action; to _take pains_ is principally an effort of the mind or the attention; to _take trouble_ is an effort of either the body or mind: a faithful minister of the Gospel _labors_ to instil Christian principles into the minds of his audience, and to heal all the breaches which the angry passions make between them: when a child is properly sensible of the value of improvement, he will take the utmost _pains_ to profit by the instruction of the master: he who is too indolent to _take_ the _trouble_ to make his wishes known to those who would comply with them cannot expect others to _trouble_ themselves with inquiring into his necessities: a good name is of such value to every man that he ought to _use_ his best _endeavors_ to preserve it unblemished.

####labyrinth 
**LABYRINTH, MAZE.**  
Intricacy is common to both the objects expressed by these terms; but the term _labyrinth_ has it to a much greater extent than _maze:_ the _labyrinth_, from the Greek _λαβύρινθος_, of Egyptian origin, was a work of antiquity which surpassed the _maze_ in the same proportion as the ancients surpassed the moderns in all other works of art; it was constructed on so prodigious a scale, and with so many windings, that when a person had once entered he could not find his way out without the assistance of a clue or thread. _Maze is_ a word of doubtful origin; it was at first used to signify dreamy thought, dreamy perplexity, and then a structure of interweaving paths which induced such a state of mind. It is a modern term for a structure similar to a labyrinth, on a smaller scale, which is frequently made by way of ornament in large gardens. From the proper meaning of the two words we may easily see the ground of their metaphorical application: political and polemical discussions are compared to a _labyrinth;_ because the mind that is once entangled in them is unable to extricate itself by any efforts of its own: on the other hand, that perplexity and confusion into which the mind is thrown by unexpected or inexplicable events is termed a _maze_, because, for the time, the brain is bereft of its power to pursue its ordinary functions of recollection and combination.

####laconic 
**LACONIC, BRIEF, CONCISE, PITHY.**  
All of these terms indicate speech which contains no unnecessary words, but they differ from each other in the idea that they suggest in addition to that common to them all. _Brief_, from Latin _brevis_, means simply short; the opposite of long — containing few words. _Concise_, from Latin _cidere, con_, intensive, and _cœdere_, to cut, means cut short — made shorter than it might naturally be — and suggests therefore a deliberate concentration in a small space. _Pithy_ adds to this idea — it means full of pith. It does not necessarily mean short; but is usually connected with that idea — suggesting the concentration of much substance in a little space. _Laconic_ comes from _Λακωνικός_, from _Λάκων_, a Laconian or inhabitant of Laconia — Laconians or Spartans being noted for their brevity of speech. It suggests not only the character of the speech — brief, to the point — but the manner of utterance.

####lambent 
**LAMBENT, FLICKERING, GLEAMING, TWINKLING.**  
_Lambent_, from the Latin _lambo_, to lick, signifies licking or playing about like flames, hence, touching lightly, or gliding over. The term is most generally applied to light from any source as affected by exterior influences. Thus, we say that a light is _flickering_ when it is moving with an unsteady and quick motion, swaying because of a sudden commotion in the air, and _flickering out_, especially the light from a candle or a lamp, when the wick or the oil is nearly consumed: _gleaming_, when it emits shooting or darting rays or exhibits unusual brightness; and _twinkling_, when it is burning unsteadily, shining with a tremulous, quivering effect, or exhibiting quick, spasmodic spurts, as the _twinkling_ of the stars. The term is often used in poetry to imply that which touches lightly or glides over.

####land 
**LAND, COUNTRY.**  
_Land_, Anglo-Saxon _land_, signifies an open, even space, and refers strictly to the earth. _Country_, through Old French _contree_, from Late Latin _contrata_, the region lying opposite, comes from _contra_, opposite. Compare German _gegend_, from _gegen_, opposite. The term _land_, therefore, in its proper sense, excludes the idea of habitation; the term _country_ excludes that of the earth, or the parts of which it is composed: hence we speak of the _land_ as rich or poor, according to what it yields: of a _country_, as rich or poor, according to what its inhabitants possess: so, in like manner, we say, the _land_ is ploughed for receiving the grain; or a man's _land_, for the ground which he possesses or occupies: but the _country_ is cultivated; the _country_ is under a good government; or a man's _country_ is dear to him.  
In an extended application, however, these words may be put for one another: the word _land_ may sometimes be put for any portion of _land_ that is under a government, as the _land_ of liberty; and _country_ may be put for any spot of earth or line of _country_, together with that which is upon it; as a rich _country._

####language 
**LANGUAGE, TONGUE, SPEECH, IDIOM, DIALECT.**  
_Language_, through Middle French _language_, based on _langue_, from the Latin _lingua_, a _tongue_, and a suffix, signifies, like the word _tongue_, that which is spoken by the _tongue_, Anglo-Saxon _tunge. Speech_ is the act of speaking, or the word _spoken. Idiom_, in Latin _idioma_, Greek _ίδίωμα_, from _ίδιος, proprius_, proper, or peculiar, signifies a peculiar mode of speaking. _Dialect_, through French from Latin _dialectus_, Greek _διάλεκτος_, from _διαλέγομαι_, to speak in a distinct manner, signifies a distinct mode of speech.  
All these terms mark the manner of expressing our thoughts, but under different circumstances. _Language_ is the most general term in its meaning and application; it conveys the general idea without any modification, and is applied to other modes of expression besides that of words, and to other objects besides persons; the _language_ of the eyes frequently supplies the place of that of the _tongue;_ the deaf and dumb use the language of signs; birds and beasts are supposed to have their peculiar _language: tongue, speech_, and the other terms are applicable only to human beings. _Language_ is either written or spoken; but a _tongue_ is conceived of mostly as something to be spoken: whence we speak of one's mother _tongue. Speech_ is an abstract term, implying either the power of uttering articulate sounds, as when we speak of the gift of _speech_, which is denied to those who are dumb; or the words themselves which are spoken, as when we speak of the parts of _speech;_ or the particular mode of expressing one's self, as that a man is known by his _speech. Idiom_ and _dialect_ are not properly a _language_, but the properties of _language: idiom_ is the peculiar construction and turn of a _languages_ which distinguishes it altogether from others; it is that which enters into the composition of the _language_, and cannot be separated from it.  
A _dialect_ is that which is engrafted on a _language_ by the inhabitants of particular parts of a country, and admitted by its writers and learned men to form an incidental part of the _language;_ as the _dialects_ which originated with the Ionians, the Athenians, the Æolians, and were afterward amalgamated into the Greek _tongue._ Whence the word _dialect_ may be extended in its application to denote any peculiar manner of speech adopted by any community.

####large 
**LARGE, WIDE, BROAD.**  
_Large_ (see [great](entry://great)) is applied in a general way to express every dimension; it implies not only abundance in solid matter, but also freedom in the space, or extent of a plane superficies. _Wide_, in Anglo-Saxon _wid_, signifies an open space unencumbered by any obstructions. _Broad_, in Anglo-Saxon _brad_, has a similar meaning. Many things are _large_, but not _wide;_ as a _large_ town, a _large_ circle, a _large_ ball, a _large_ nut: other things are both _large_ and _wide;_ as a _large_ field, or a _wide_ field: a _large_ house, or a _wide_ house: but the field is said to be _large_ from the quantity of ground it contains; it is said to be _wide_ both from its figure and the extent of its space in the cross directions; in like manner, a house is _large_ from its extent in all directions; it is said to be _wide_ from the extent which it runs in front: some things are said to be _wide_ which are not denominated _large_, that is, either such things as have less bulk and quantity than extent of plane surface; as ell-wide cloth, a _wide_ opening, a _wide_ entrance, and the like; or such as have an extent of space only one way; as a _wide_ road, a _wide_ path, a _wide_ passage, and the like. What is _broad_ is in sense, and mostly in application, _wide_, but not _vice versa:_ a ribbon is _broad;_ a ledge _broad;_ a ditch is _broad;_ a plank is _broad;_ the brim of a hat is _broad;_ or the border of anything is _broad;_ on the other hand, a mouth is _wide_, but not _broad;_ apertures in general are _wide_, but not _broad. Large_ is opposed to small; _wide_ to close; _broad_ to narrow. In the moral application, we speak of _largeness_ in regard to liberality; _wide_ and _broad_ only in the figurative sense of space or size: as a _wide_ difference; or a _broad_ line of distinction.  
**LARGELY, COPIOUSLY, FULLY.** — _Largely_ is here taken in the moral sense, and, if the derivation given of it be true, in the most proper sense. _Copiously_ comes from the Latin _copia_, plenty, signifying in a plentiful degree. _Fully_ signifies in a _full_ degree; to the _full_ extent, as far as it can reach.  
Quantity is the idea expressed in common by all these terms; but _largely_ has always a reference to the freedom of the will in the agent; _copiously_ qualifies actions that are done by inanimate objects; _fully_ qualifies the actions of a rational agent, but it denotes a degree or extent which cannot be surpassed. A person deals _largely_ in things, or he drinks _large_ draughts; rivers are _copiously_ supplied in rainy seasons; a person is _fully_ satisfied or _fully_ prepared. A bountiful Providence has distributed His gifts _largely_ among His creatures: blood flows _copiously_ from a deep wound when it is first made: when a man is not _fully_ convinced of his own insufficiency he is not prepared to listen to the counsel of others.

####last 
**LAST, LATEST, FINAL, ULTIMATE.**  
_Last_ and _latest_ are both from _latst_, the superlative of Anglo-Saxon _lœt_, slow — Modern English _late_ — allied to Latin _lassus_, which is found in English words like _lassitude. Final_ (see that word). _Ultimate_ comes from Latin _ultimatus_, participle of _ultimare_, based on _ultimus_, the last.  
_Last_ and _ultimate_ concern the order of succession: _latest_, the order of time; _final_, the completion of an object. What is _last_ or _ultimate_ is succeeded by nothing else: what is _latest_ is succeeded at no great interval of time; what is _final_ requires to be succeeded by nothing else. The _last_ is opposed to the first; the _ultimate is_ distinguished from that which immediately precedes it; the _latest_ is opposed to the earliest; the _final_ is opposed to the introductory or beginning. A person's _last_ words are those by which one is guided; his _ultimate_ object is sometimes remote or concealed from the view; a conscientious man remains firm to his principles to his _latest_ breath; _the final_ determination of difficult matters requires caution. Jealous people strive not to be the _last_ in anything; the _latest_ intelligence which a man gets of his country is acceptable to one who is in distant quarters of the globe; it requires resolution to take a _final_ leave of those whom one holds near and dear.

**LASTLY, AT LAST, AT LENGTH.** — _Lastly_, like _last_, implies the order of succession: _at last_ or _at length_ refers to what has preceded. When a sermon is divided into many heads, the term _lastly_ comprehends the _last_ division. When an affair is settled after much difficulty, it is said to be _at last_ settled; and if it be settled after a protracted continuance, it is said to be settled _at length._

####laudable 
**LAUDABLE, PRAISEWORTHY, COMMENDABLE.**  
_Laudable_, from the Latin _laudare_, to praise, is in sense literally _praiseworthy_, that is, _worthy of praise_ or to be _praised_ (see [praise](entry://praise)). _Commendable_ signifies entitled to _commendation_, from Latin _con_, together, and _mandare_, to place in the hands of — that is to say, worthy of trust, hence worthy of praise.  
_Laudable_ is used in a general application; _praiseworthy_ and _commendable_ are applied to individuals: things are _laudable_ in themselves; they are _praiseworthy_ or _commendable_ in this or that person. That which is _laudable_ is entitled to encouragement and general approbation; an honest endeavor to be useful to one's family or one's self is at all times _laudable_, and will insure the support of all good people. What is _praiseworthy_ obtains the respect of all men: as all have temptations to do that which is wrong, the performance of one's duty is in all cases _praiseworthy_, but particularly so in those cases where it opposes one's interests and interferes with one's pleasures. What is _commendable_ is not equally as important as the former two; it entitles a person only to a temporary or partial expression of good-will and approbation; the performance of those minor and particular duties which belong to children and subordinate persons is in the proper sense _commendable._

####laugh 
**LAUGH, RIDICULE.**  
_Laugh_ is the Anglo-Saxon word, from _hlihan_, an imitative word; _ridicule_, from _ridiculus_, is the Latin term, from _ridere_, to smile or laugh.  
Both these verbs are used here in the sense for _laughter_, blended with more or less of contempt: but the former displays itself by the natural expression of _laughter:_ the latter shows itself by a verbal expression: the former is produced by a feeling of mirth on observing the real or supposed weakness of another; the latter is produced by a strong sense of the absurd or irrational in another: the former is more immediately directed to the person who has excited the feeling; the latter is more commonly produced by things than by persons. We _laugh at_ a person to his face; but we _ridicule_ his notions by writing or in the course of conversation: we _laugh at_ the individual: we _ridicule_ that which is maintained by him.  
**LAUGHABLE, LUDICROUS, RIDICULOUS, COMICAL, COMIC, DROLL.** — _Laughable_ signifies exciting, or fit to excite, _laughter. Ludicrous_, in Latin _ludicrus_, from _ludus_, a game, signifies belonging to a game or sport. _Ridiculous_, exciting, or fit to excite, _ridicule._  
Either the direct action of _laughter_ or a corresponding sentiment is included in the signification of all these terms: they differ principally in the cause which produces the feeling; the _laughable_ consists of objects in general, whether personal or otherwise; the _ludicrous_ and _ridiculous_ have reference more or less to that which is personal. What is _laughable_ may excite simple merriment independently of all personal reference, unless we admit what Mr. Hobbes, and after him Addison, have maintained of all _laughter_, that it springs from pride. But without entering into this nice question, I am inclined to distinguish between the _laughable_ which arises from the reflection of what is to our own advantage or pleasure, and that which arises from reflecting on what is to the disadvantage of another. The tricks of a monkey or the humorous stories of wit are _laughable_ from the nature of the things themselves, without any apparent allusion, however remote, to any individual but the one whose senses or mind is gratified. The _ludicrous_ and _ridiculous_ are, however, species of the _laughable_ which arise altogether from reflecting on that which is to the disadvantage of another; but the _ludicrous_ has in it less to the disadvantage of another than the _ridiculous._ It is possible, therefore, for a person to be in a _ludicrous_ situation without any kind of moral demerit, or the slightest depreciation of his moral character; since that which renders his situation _ludicrous_ is altogether independent of himself; or it becomes _ludicrous_ only in the eyes of incompetent judges. "Let an ambassador, " says Mr. Pope, "speak the best sense in the world, and deport himself in the most graceful manner before a prince, yet if the tail of his shirt happen, as I have known it happen to a very wise man, to hang out behind, more people will _laugh_ at that than attend to the other. " This is the _ludicrous._ The same can seldom be said of the _ridiculous;_ for as this springs from positive moral causes, it reflects on the person to whom it attaches in a less questionable shape and produces positive disgrace. Persons very rarely appear _ridiculous_ without being really so; and he who is really _ridiculous_ justly excites contempt.  
_Droll_ and _comical_ are in the proper sense applied to things which cause _laughter_, as when we speak of a _droll_ story, or a _comical_ incident, or a _comic_ song. They may be applied to the person; but not so as to reflect disadvantageously on the individual, as in the former terms.

####lawful 
**LAWFUL, LEGAL, LEGITIMATE, LICIT.**  
_Lawful_ is the adjective corresponding to _law_, a Scandinavian word from the root found in _lie_, a _law_ being that which is _laid_ down, which is fixed or established. _Legal_ comes from Latin _legalis_, from _lex_, from the root found in _legere_, to collect — _law_ being the _collection_ of the customs and judgments of the people in one standard code of action. _Legitimate_ has the same derivation. They differ, therefore, according to the sense of the word _law; lawful_ signifies the _law_ in general, defined or undefined; _legal_, only the _law_ of the land which is defined; _legitimate_, the laws or rules of science as well as civil matters in general. _Licit_, from the Latin _licet_, it is allowed, is used only to characterize the moral quality of actions; the _lawful_ properly implies conformable to or enjoined by _law;_ the _legal_ what is in the form or after the manner of _law_, or binding by _law:_ it is not _lawful_ to coin money with the king's stamp; a marriage was formerly not _legal_ in England which was not solemnized according to the rites of the Established Church: men's passions impel them to do many things which are _unlawful_ or _illicit;_ their ignorance leads them into many things which are _illegal_ or _illegitimate._ As a good citizen and a true Christian, every man will be anxious to avoid everything which is _unlawful:_ it is the business of the lawyer to define what is _legal_ or _illegal:_ it is the business of the critic to define what is _legitimate_ verse in poetry; it is the business of the linguist to define the _legitimate_ use of words: it is the business of the moralist to point out what is _illicit._

####lay 
**LAY, TAKE HOLD OF, CATCH, SEIZE, SNATCH, GRASP, GRIPE.**  
To _lay_ or _take hold of_ is here the generic expression; it denotes simply getting into one's possession, which is the common idea in the signification of all these terms, which differ in regard to the motion in which the action is performed. To _catch_ is to _lay hold of_ with an effort. To _seize_ is to _lay hold of_ with violence. To _snatch_ is to _lay hold of_ by a sudden effort. One is said to _lay hold of_ that on which one places his hand; he _takes hold of_ that which he secures in his hand. We _lay hold of_ anything when we see it falling; we _take hold of_ anything when we wish to lift it up; we _catch_ what attempts to escape; we _seize_ it when it makes resistance; we _snatch_ that which we are particularly afraid of not getting otherwise. A person who is fainting _lays hold of_ the first thing which comes in his way; a sick person or one that wants support _takes hold of_ another's arm in walking; various artifices are employed to _catch_ animals; the wild beasts of the forest _seize_ their prey the moment they come within their reach; it is the rude sport of a school-boy to _snatch_ out of the hand of another that which he is not willing to let go.  
To _lay hold of_ is to get in the possession. To _grasp_ and to _gripe_ signify to have or keep in the possession; an eagerness to keep or not to let go is expressed by that of _grasping;_ a fearful anxiety of losing and an earnest desire of keeping are expressed by the act of _gripping._ When a famished man _lays hold of_ food he _grasps_ it, from a convulsive kind of fear lest it should leave him: when a miser _lays hold of_ money he _gripes_ it from the love he bears to it, and the fear he has that it will be taken from him.

####lead 
**LEAD, CONDUCT, GUIDE.**  
_Lead_ is the Anglo-Saxon word, originally _lœdan_, corresponding to Latin _ducere_, found here in _conduct_, from _cum_, with, and _ducere_, to lead. For the origin of _guide_ see [chaperon](entry://chaperon).  
All these terms are employed to denote the influence which a person has over the movements or actions of some person. To _lead_ is an unqualified action: one _leads_ by helping a person onward in any manner, as to _lead_ a child by the hand, or to _lead_ a person through a wood by going before him. To _conduct_ and _guide_ are different modes of _leading_, the former by virtue of one's office or authority, the latter by one's knowledge or power; as to _conduct_ an army, or to _conduct_ a person into the presence of another; to _guide_ a traveller in an unknown country. These words may therefore be applied to the same objects: a general _leads_ an army, inasmuch as he goes before it into the field; he _conducts_ an army, inasmuch as he directs its operations; the stable-boy _leads_ the horses to water; the coachman _guides_ the horses in a carriage.  
_Conduct_ and _guide_ may also be applied in this sense to inanimate objects; as the pilot _conducts_ the vessel into the port, the steersman _guides_ a vessel by the help of the rudder.  
In the moral application of these terms, persons may _lead_ or _guide_ other persons, but they _conduct_ things; as to_ lead_ a person into a course of life; to _guide him_ in a course of reading or study; to _conduct_ a lawsuit, or any particular business. To _lead_, being a matter of purely personal influence, may be either for the benefit or injury of the person _led._  
To _conduct_, supposing judgment and management, and to _guide_, supposing superior intelligence, are always taken in the good sense, unless otherwise qualified.  
Things as well as persons may _lead, conduct_, and _guide_, with a similar distinction. Whatever serves as a motive of action, or as a course and passage to a place or an object, _leads._  
Whatever influences our conduct rightly _conducts._  
Whatever serves as a rule or _guide guides._  
As persons may sometimes be false _guides_, so tilings may furnish a false rule.

####lean 
**LEAN, MEAGRE.**  
_Lean_ is the Anglo-Saxon word, from _hlœne_, originally bending or stooping, hence inclined to bend, or thin; _meagre_ is probably a Latin word from _macer_, thin, Greek _μακρός_, long, though it early appears in Anglo-Saxon as _mœger_, probably borrowed from the Continent.  
_Lean_ denotes want of fat; _meagre_ want of flesh: what is _lean_ is not always _meagre;_ but nothing can be _meagre_ without being _lean._ Brutes as well as men are _lean_, but men only are said to be _meagre: leanness_ is frequently connected with the temperament; _meagreness_ is the consequence of starvation and disease. There are some animals by nature inclined to be _lean;_ a _meagre_, pale visage is to be seen perpetually in the haunts of vice and poverty.  
**LEAN, INCLINE, BEND.** — _Lean_, in Anglo-Saxon _hlœnan_ (see above), is derived from the root found in _incline_, from the Latin, Greek _κλίνω_, I bend. _Bend_ (see that word).  
In the proper sense, _lean_ and _incline_ are both said of the position of bodies; _bend is_ said of the shape of bodies: that which _leans_ rests on one side, or in asideward direction; that which _inclines leans_ or turns only in a slight degree: that which _bends_ forms a curvature; it does not all _lean_ the same way: a house _leans_ when the foundation gives way: a tree may grow so as to _incline_ to the right or the left, or a road may _incline_ this or that way; a tree or a road _bends_ when it turns out of the straight course. In another sense, the judgment _leans_, the will _inclines_, the will or conduct _bends_, in consequence of some outward action. A person _leans_ to this or that side of a question which he favors; he _inclines_, or is _inclined_, to this or that mode of conduct; he _bends_ to the will of another. It is the duty of a judge to _lean_ to the side of mercy as far as is consistent with justice: whoever _inclines_ too readily to listen to the tales of distress which are continually told to excite compassion will find himself in general deceived; an _unbending_ temper is the bane of domestic felicity.

####leave 
**LEAVE, QUIT, RELINQUISH.**  
_Leave_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _lœfan_, to leave, corresponding to the Latin _linquere_, found in _relinquish. Quit_, in French _quitter_, from the Latin _quietus_, rest, signifies to rest or remain, to give up the hold of. _Relinquish_ (see [abandon](entry://abandon)).  
We _leave_ that to which we may intend to return; we _quit_ that to which we return no more: we may _leave_ a place voluntarily or otherwise; but we _relinquish_ it unwillingly. We _leave_ persons or things; we _quit_ and _relinquish_ things only. I _leave_ one person in order to speak to another; I _leave_ my house for a short time; I _quit_ it not to return to it.  
_Leave_ and _quit_ may be used in the improper as well as the proper sense. It is the privilege of the true Christian to be able to _leave_ all the enjoyments of this life, not only with composure, but with satisfaction; dogs have sometimes evinced their fidelity, even to the remains of their masters, by not _quitting_ the spot where they are laid; prejudices, particularly in matters of religion, acquire so deep a root in the mind that they cannot be made to _relinquish_ their hold by the most persuasive eloquence and forcible reasoning.

_Leave, Take Leave, Bid Farewell_ or **ADIEU.** — _Leave_ is here general as before; it expresses simply the idea of separating one's self from an object, whether for a time or otherwise; to _take have_ and _bid farewell_ imply a separation for a perpetuity. _Farewell_ is a native English expression meaning "May you fare well"; _adieu_ is French, from the phrase _à Dieu_, Latin _ad Deum_, meaning "I commit you to God's keeping. "  
To _leave_ is an unqualified action; it is applied to objects of indifference, or otherwise, but supposes in general no exercise of one's feelings. We _leave_ persons as convenience requires; we _leave_ them on the road, in the field, in the house, or wherever circumstances direct; we _leave_ them with or without speaking; but to _take leave_ is a parting ceremony between friends, on their parting for a considerable time; to _bid farewell_, or _adieu_, is a still more solemn ceremony, when the parting is expected to be final. When applied to things, we _leave_ such as we do not wish to meddle with; we _take have_ of those things which were agreeable to us, but which we find it prudent to give up; and we _bid farewell_ to those for which we still retain a great attachment. It is better to _leave_ a question undecided than to attempt to decide it by altercation or violence; it is greater virtue in a man to _take have_ of his vices than to let them _take leave_ of him; when a man engages in schemes of ambition, he must _bid adieu_ to all the enjoyments of domestic life.  
**LEAVE, LIBERTY, PERMISSION, LICENSE.** — _Leave_ as here used is a word of different origin, from Anglo-Saxon _leof_, dear, found in English _lief_ — meaning here pleasure, hence freedom of will, literally permission "to do as you please. " _Liberty_ is also taken for _liberty_ granted, from Latin _liber_, free. _Permission_ signifies the act of _permitting_ (see [allow](entry://allow)) or the thing _permitted. License_, in Latin _licentia_, from _licet_, it is lawful, signifies the state of being _permitted_ by law or authority.  
_Leave_ and _liberty_ may sometimes be taken as well as given; _permission_ and _license_ are never to be taken, but must always be granted, and that in an especial manner — the former by express words, the latter by some acknowledged and mostly legal form. _Leave_ is employed only on familiar occasions; _liberty_ is given in more important matters: the master gives _leave_ to his servant to go out for his pleasure; a gentleman gives his friends the _liberty_ of shooting on his grounds: _leave_ is taken in indifferent matters, particularly as it respects _leave_ of absence; _liberty_ is taken by a greater, and in general an unauthorized, stretch of one's powers, and is, therefore, an infringement on the rights of another. What is done without the _leave_ may be done without the knowledge, though not contrary to the will of another; but _liberties_ which are taken without offering an apology are always calculated to give offence. _Leave_ respects only particular and private matters; _liberty_ respects general or particular matters, public or private; as _liberty_ of speech, _liberty_ of the press, and the like.  
_Leave_ and _permission_ are both the acts of private individuals in special cases. The _permission_ is a more formal and less familiar act than _leave;_ the _permission_ is often an act of courtesy passing between equals and friends; the _leave_ is properly said of what passes from superiors to inferiors: a person obtains _leave_ of absence. The _license_ is always general, or resting on some general authority; as the _licenses_ given by government, and poetic _licenses._ Whenever applied to individuals it carries with it the idea of a special authority; as a _license_ given by a landlord to the tenant to assign his lease.  
**LEAVINGS, REMAINS.** — _Leavings_ are the consequences of a voluntary act: they signify what is left: _remains_ are what follow in the course of things; they are what _remains;_ the former is therefore taken in the sense to signify what has been left as worthless; the latter is never taken in this sense. When many persons of good taste have the liberty of choosing, it is fair to expect that the _leavings_ will be worth little or nothing, after all have made their choice. By the _remains_ of beauty which are discoverable in the face of a female we may be enabled to estimate what her personal gifts were.

####legendary 
**LEGENDARY, FABULOUS, MYTHICAL, TRADITIONAL.**  
These are all adjectives signifying the quality of old stories handed down from generation to generation either in oral or written form. _Legendary_ comes from the gerundive of Latin _legere_, to collect or read; it signifies worthy of being collected and read, or characteristic of old collections of tales. _Fabulous_, from Latin _fabula_, a story, signifies storylike, with an emphasis upon the difference between the story which is the product of the untrammelled imagination and the plain reality. _Mythical_ comes from Greek _μΰθος_, a fable. _Tradition_ comes from Latin _tradere_, to hand down — signifying that which is handed down by word of mouth. _Legendary_ and _traditional_ differ from each other in the indication of the means of communication; the one is written, the other is generally oral, though these distinctions are not strictly observed. We speak of "written _tradition_" and denominate as _legends_ stories that have never been written. _Traditional_ has more of truth and seriousness than _legendary._ A _tradition_ is preserved as a record of some fact, and the changes that it undergoes are usually due to natural mistakes and failures of memory; a _legend_ is usually handed down because it is interesting — it makes a good story worthy of being read, and hence it may be improved by the imaginations of successive generations. _Mythical_ suggests less of fact and veracity. A _mythical_ hero; a _mythical_ land are those which exist only in the imagination of those who tell about them. _Mythical_ sometimes refers especially to the _myths_ or old stories of the divinities and heroes preserved by various nations. It therefore suggests stories of the supernatural, and has some of the dignity of a _tradition_ or _legend. Fabulous_ has none of this traditional credibility and seriousness; something _fabulous_ is a deliberate creation of the imagination transcending all bounds of reality. However, there are several curious modifications of these words. _Fabulous_, while suggesting the wildly extravagant, the apparently impossible, etc., does not arouse the same degree of incredulity that is aroused by _mythical. Mythical_ wealth is wealth which is said to exist but does not; _fabulous_ wealth is wealth transcending all bounds of probability, with the implication that it does really exist. _Mythical_ indicates that which is believed but does not exist; _fabulous_ that which is not believed but does exist. There is always a distinct difference in the significance of these four words; they are interchangeable only within some definite limits. The _traditional_ splendor of a noble family, for instance, means _splendor_ enduring from generation to generation both in memory and in reality; _legendary_ splendor means splendor described in old stories, existent long ago, but not now; _mythical_ splendor means that which is said to be but is not; _fabulous_ splendor, splendor now existent but so great as to seem impossible.

####let 
**LET, LEAVE, SUFFER.**  
The removal of hindrance or constraint on the actions of others is implied by all these terms; but _let_, like the German _lassen_, to leave, is a less formal action than _leave_, and this than _suffer_, from the Latin _suffero_, to bear with, signifying not to put a stop to. I _let_ a person pass in the road by getting out of his way: I _leave_ a person to decide on a matter according to his own discretion, by declining to interfere; I _suffer_ a person over whom I am expected to exercise a control to go his own way. It is in general most prudent to _let_ things take their own course: in the education of youth, the greatest art lies in _leaving_ them to follow the natural bent of their minds and turn of the disposition, and at the same time not _suffering_ them to do anything prejudicial to their character or future in-

####letter 
**LETTER, EPISTLE.**  
According to the origin of these words, _letter_, in Latin _literœ_, signifies any document composed of written _letters;_ and _epistle_, in Greek _έπιστολή_, from _έπιστέλλω_, to send, signifies a _letter_ sent or addressed to any one; consequently the former is the generic, the latter the specific term. _Letter_ is a term altogether familiar; it may be used for whatever is written by one friend to another in domestic life, or for the public documents of this description which have emanated from the pen of writers, as the _letters_ of Madame de Sévigné, the _letters_ of Pope or of Swift; and even those which were written by the ancients, as the _letters_ of Cicero, Pliny, and Seneca; but in strict propriety those are entitled _epistles_, as a term most adapted to whatever has received the sanction of ages, and by the same rule, likewise, whatever is peculiarly solemn in its contents has acquired the same epithet, as the _epistles_ of St. Paul, St. Peter, St. John, St. Jude; and by an analogous rule, whatever poetry is written in the _epistolary_ form is denominated an _epistle_ rather than a _letter_, whether of ancient or modern date, as the _epistles_ of Horace, or the _epistles_ of Boileau; and, finally, whatever is addressed by way of dedication is denominated a dedicatory _epistle._ Ease and a friendly familiarity should characterize the _letter:_ sentiment and instruction are always conveyed by an _epistle._

**LETTERS, LITERATURE, LEARNING.** — _Letters_ and _literature_ signify knowledge, derived through the medium of written _letters_ or books, that is, information: _learning_ (see **knowledge** under [know](entry://know)) is confined to that which is communicated, that is, scholastic knowledge. The term men of _letters_ or the republic of _letters_ comprehends all who devote themselves to the cultivation of their minds: _literary_ societies have for their object the diffusion of general information: _learned_ societies propose to themselves the higher object of extending the bounds of science and increasing the sum of human knowledge. Men of _letters_ have a passport for admittance into the highest circles; _literary_ men can always find resources for themselves in their own society: _learned_ men, or men of _learning_, are more the objects of respect and admiration than of imitation.

####lie 
**LIE, LAY.**  
By a vulgar error these verbs have been so confounded as to deserve some notice. To _lie_ is neuter, and designates a state: to _lay_ is active, and denotes an action on an object; it is properly to cause to _lie;_ a thing _lies_ on the table; some one _lays_ it on the table; he _lies_ with his fathers; they _laid_ him with his fathers. In the same manner, when used idiomatically, we say a thing _lies_ by us until we bring it into use; we _lay_ it by for some future purpose: we _lie_ down in order to repose ourselves; we _lay_ money down by way of deposit: the disorder _lies_ in the constitution; we _lay_ a burden upon our friends.

####lifeless 
**LIFELESS, DEAD, INANIMATE.**  
_Lifeless_ and _dead_ suppose the absence of life where it has once been; _inanimate_ supposes its absence where it has never been; a person from whom life has departed is said to be _lifeless_ or _dead;_ the material world consists of objects which are by nature _inanimate. Lifeless_ is negative: it signifies simply without life or the vital spark: _dead_ is positive; it denotes an actual and complete change in the object. We may speak of a _lifeless_ corpse when speaking of a body which sinks from a state of _animation_ into that of _inanimation;_ we speak of _dead_ bodies to designate such as have undergone an entire change. A person, therefore, in whom _animation_ is suspended is, for the time being, in appearance at least, _lifeless_, although we should not say _dead._  
In the moral acceptation, _lifeless_ and _inanimate_ denote the want of that _life_ or _animation_ which is requisite or proper; _dead_ implies the total want of moral feeling which ought to exist.

####lift 
**LIFT, HEAVE, HOIST.**  
These are all Teutonic words that have come into modern English through different Teutonic languages. _Lift_, Middle English_ liften_, is a Scandinavian word associated with German _luft_, air, meaning to raise in the air. _Heave_ is an Anglo-Saxon word from the root found also in Latin _capere_, to take. _Hoist_ is a Dutch word, from Middle Dutch _hyssen_, to lift up.  
The idea of making high is common to all these words, but they differ in the objects and the circumstances of the action; we _lift_ with or without an effort: we _heave_ and _hoist_ always with an effort; we _lift_ a child up to let him see anything more distinctly; workmen _heave_ the stones or beams which are used in a building; sailors _hoist_ the long-boat into the water. To _lift_ and _hoist_ are transitive verbs; they require an agent and an object: _heave_ is intransitive; it may have an inanimate object for an agent: a person _lifts_ his hand to his head; when whales are killed, they are _hoisted_ into vessels; the bosom _heaves_ when it is oppressed with sorrow; the waves of the sea _heave_ when they are agitated by the wind.  
**LIFT, RAISE, ERECT, ELEVATE, EXALT.** — The idea of making a thing higher than it was before is common to these verbs. To _lift_ (see [lift](entry://lift)) is to take up from a given spot by a direct application of force. To _raise_, a Scandinavian word, meaning to cause to rise, to _erect_, from the Latin _erectum_, supine of _erigo;_ to _elevate_, from _elevatus_, participle of _elevare_, based on _e_, out, and _levare_, to raise, signify to make higher by a variety of means, but not necessarily by moving the object from the spot where it rests. We _lift_ a stool with our hands, we _raise_ a stool by giving it longer legs; we _erect_ a monument by heaping one stone upon another; a mountain is _elevated_ so many feet above the surface of the sea. Whatever is to be carried is _lifted;_ whatever is to be situated higher is to be _raised;_ whatever is to be constructed above other objects is to be _erected;_ and when the perpendicular height is to be described, it is said to be _elevated._ A ladder is _lifted_ upon the shoulders: a standard ladder is _raised_ against a wall; a scaffolding is _erected;_ a pillar is _elevated_ above the houses.  
_Lift_ and _raise_ may sometimes be applied to the same objects: a stone may either be _lifted_ or _raised_, but _lift_ is the more ordinary term; so when _raise_ and _erect_ are applied to the same objects, _raise_ is the more familiar expression. _Elevate is_ most usual in scientific language. All these terms, except _erect_, have likewise a moral application; _exalt_, from _altus_, high, has no other. In tins case _lift_ is seldom used in a good sense; to _raise_ is used in a good or an indifferent sense; to _elevate is_ mostly, and _exalt_ always, used in the best sense. A person is seldom _lifted_ up for any good purpose, or from any merit in himself; it is commonly to suit the ends of party that people are _lifted_ into notice or _lifted_ into office; a person may be _raised_ for his merits, or _raise_ himself by his industry, in both of which cases he is entitled to esteem; so likewise one may be _lifted_ up by pride, or _raised_ in one's mind or estimation; one is _elevated_ by circumstances, but still more so by one's character and moral qualities; one is rarely _exalted_ but by means of superior endowments.  
In modern building construction the term _elevator_ is synonymous with _lift._

####lightness 
**LIGHTNESS, LEVITY, FLIGHTINESS, VOLATILITY, GIDDINESS.**  
_Lightness_, from Anglo-Saxon _leoht_, light, signifies an abstract quality. _Levity_, in Latin _levitas_, from _levis_, light, signifies the same. _Volatility_, in Latin _volatilitas_, from _volare_, to fly, signifies flitting, or ready to fly swiftly on. _Flightiness_, from _flighty and fly_, signifies a readiness to fly. _Giddiness_ is from Anglo-Saxon _gidig_, insane, possibly from Anglo-Saxon _god_, God, meaning possessed by a god, in which case it has the same origin as _enthusiasm_, from Greek _εγθίος_, a god within.  
_Lightness_ and _giddiness_ are taken either in the natural or metaphorical sense; the rest only in the moral sense; _lightness_ is said of the outward carriage or the inward temper; _levity_ is said only of the outward carriage: a light-minded man treats everything _lightly_, be it ever so serious; the _lightness_ of his mind is evident by the _lightness_ of his motions. _Lightness_ is common to both sexes; _levity_ is peculiarly striking in women; and in respect to them, they are both exceptional qualities in the highest degree: when a woman has _lightness_ of mind, she may easily tend toward vice; when there is _levity_ in her conduct, she exposes herself to public criticism. _Volatility, flightiness_, and _giddiness_ are degrees of _lightness_ which rise in signification on one another; _volatility_ being more than _lightness_, and the others more than _volatility: lightness_ and _volatility_ are defects as they relate to age; those only who ought to be serious or grave are said to be _light_ or _volatile._ When we treat that as _light_ which is weighty, when we suffer nothing to sink into the mind, or make any impression, this is a defective _lightness_ of character; when the spirits are of a buoyant nature, and the thoughts fly from one object to another, without resting on any for a moment, this _lightness_ becomes _volatility:_ a _light-minded_ person sets care at a distance; a _volatile_ person catches pleasure from every passing object. _Flightiness_ and _giddiness_ are the defects of youth; they bespeak that entire want of command over the feelings and animal spirits which is inseparable from a state of childhood; a _flighty_ child, however, fails only from a want of attention; but a _giddy_ child, like one whose head is in the natural sense _giddy_, is unable to collect itself so as to have any consciousness of what passes: a _flighty_ person makes mistakes; a _giddy_ person commits extravagances.

####likeness 
**LIKENESS, RESEMBLANCE, SIMILARITY, SIMILITUDE.**  
_Likeness_ denotes the quality of being _alike_ (see [equal](entry://equal)). _Resemblance_, from _resemble_, compounded of _re_ and _semble_, in French _sembler_, Latin _simulo_, from _similis_, like, signifies putting on the form of another thing. _Similarity_, from a hypothetical Latin _similaritas_, extended from _similis_, and allied to English _same_, denotes the abstract property of _likeness. Likeness_ is the most general, and at the same time the most familiar, term of the three; it implies either external or internal properties: _resemblance_ implies only the external properties: _similarity_ the circumstances or properties: we speak of a _likeness_ between two persons; of a _resemblance_ in the cast of the eye; of a _resemblance_ in the form or figure; of a _similarity_ in age and disposition. _Likeness_ is said only of that which is actual; _resemblance_ may be said of that which is apparent: a _likeness_ consists of something specific; a _resemblance_ may be only partial and contingent. A thing is said to be, but not to appear, _like_ another; it may, however, have the shadow of a _resemblance:_ whatever things are _alike_ are _alike_ in their essential properties; but they may _resemble_ one another in a partial degree or in certain particulars, but are otherwise essentially different. We are most _like_ the Divine Being in the act of doing good; there is nothing existing in nature which has not certain points of _resemblance_ with something else.  
_Similarity_ or _similitude_, which is a higher term, is in the moral application, in regard to _likeness_, what _resemblance_ is in the physical sense: what is _alike_ has the same nature; what is _similar_ has certain features of _similarity:_ in this sense feelings are _alike_, sentiments are _alike_, persons are _alike;_ but cases are _similar_, circumstances are _similar_, conditions are _similar. Likeness_ excludes the idea of difference; _similarity_ includes only the idea of casual _likeness._  
**LIKENESS, PICTURE, IMAGE, EFFIGY.** — In the former article _likeness_ is considered as an abstract term, but in connection with the words _picture_ and _image_ it signifies the representation of _likeness. Picture_, in Latin _pictura_, from _pingere_, to paint, signifies the thing painted. _Image_, in Latin _imago_, from the root _im_, found also in _imitari_, English _imitate_, signifies an imitation. _Effigy_, in Latin _effigies_, from _ex_, from, and _fingere_, to fashion, signifies that which is fashioned from or after the _image_ of another thing.  
_Likeness_ and _picture_, as terms of art, are both applied to painting; but the term _likeness_ refers us to the object of the art, namely, to get the _likeness;_ and the _picture_ to the mode of the art, namely, by painting; whence in familiar language an artist is said to take _likenesses_ who takes or paints the portraits of persons; or in general terms an artist may be said to be happy in taking a _likeness_ who can represent on paper the _likeness_ of any object, but particularly that of persons. In other connections the word_ picture_ is most usually employed in regard to works of art, as to sketch a _picture_, to finish a _picture_, and the like.  
As a _likeness_ may be given by other means besides that of painting, it may be taken for any _likeness_ conveyed; as parents may be said to stamp or impress a _likeness_ on their children. _Picture_ may be figuratively taken for whatever serves as a _picture_, as a _picture_ of happiness. _Image_, as appears from its derivation, signifies nothing more than _likeness_, but has been usually applied to such _likenesses_ as are taken, or intended to represent spiritual objects, whether on paper or in wood or stone, such as the graven _images_ which were the objects of idolatrous worship: it has, however, been extended in its application to any _likeness_ of one object represented by another; as children are sometimes the _image_ of their parents.  
A _likeness_ and a _picture_ contain actual _likenesses_ of the things which they are intended to represent; but an _effigy_ may be only an arbitrary _likeness_, as where a human figure is made to stand for the figure of any particular man without any _likeness_ of the individual. This term is applied to the rude or fictitious _pictures_ of persons in books, and also to the figures of persons on tombstones or on coins, which contain but few traces of _likeness._ Or to the still ruder representations of individuals who are held up to public odium by the populace.

####limit 
**LIMIT, EXTENT.**  
_Limit_ is a more specific and definite term than _extent:_ by the former we are directed to the point where anything ends; by the latter we are led to no particular point, but to the whole space included: _limits_ are in their nature something finite; _extent_ is either finite or infinite: we therefore speak of that which exceeds _limits_ or comes within the _limits;_ and of that which comprehends the _extent_ or is according to the _extent:_ a plenipotentiary or minister must not exceed the _limits_ of his instruction; when we think of the immense _extent_ of this globe, and that it is among the smallest of an infinite number of worlds, the mind is lost in admiration and amazement: it does not fall within the _limits_ of a periodical work to enter into historical details; a complete history of any country is a work of great _extent._

####linger 
**LINGER, TARRY, LOITER, LAG, SAUNTER.**  
_Linger_ is a frequentative of Middle English _lengen_, from Anglo-Saxon _lang_, Modern English _long_, meaning to keep lengthening the time it takes to do something. _Tarry_ comes from Middle English _tarien_, to irritate, worry, or vex; hence to hinder or delay. _Loiter_ comes from Middle Dutch _leuteren_, to trifle. _Lag_ is a Celtic word meaning late or sluggish. _Saunter_ is a word of uncertain origin, perhaps connected with _adventure_, indicating idle, planless going.  
Suspension of action or slow movement enters into the meaning of all these terms: to _linger_ is to stop altogether, or to move but slowly forward; to _tarry_ is properly to suspend one's movement: the former proceeds from reluctance to leave the spot on which we stand; the latter from motives of discretion: one will naturally _linger_ who is going to leave the place of his nativity for an indefinite period; those who have much business to transact will be led to _tarry_ long in a place: to _loiter_ is to move slowly and reluctantly; but, from a bad cause, a child _loiters_ who is unwilling to go to school: to _lag_ is to move slower than others, to stop while they are going on; this is seldom done for a good purpose; those who _lag_ have generally some sinister and private end to answer: to _saunter_ is altogether the act of an idler; those who have no object in moving either backward or forward will _saunter_ if they move at all. 

####liquid 
**LIQUID, LIQUOR, JUICE.**  
_Liquid_ (see [fluid](entry://fluid)) is the generic term: _liquor_, which is but a variation from the same Latin verb, _liquere_, to be moist, whence _liquid_ is derived, is a _liquid_ which is made to be drunk: _juice_, in French _jus_, Latin _ius_, broth, soup, is a _liquid_ that issues from bodies. All natural bodies consist of _liquids_ or solids, or a combination of both: _liquor_ serves to quench the thirst as food satisfies the hunger; the _juices_ of bodies are frequently their richest parts; water is the simplest of all _liquids;_ wine is the most inviting of all _liquors;_ the orange produces the most agreeable _juice._

####list 
**LIST, ROLL, CATALOGUE, REGISTER.**  
_List_ is derived through French _liste_, from Old High German _lista_, a border, hence a strip, a long strip on which names were written. _Roll_, from Latin _rotula_, a little wheel, signifies in general anything _rolled_ up, particularly paper with its written contents. _Catalogue_, in Latin _catalogue_, Greek _κατάλογος·_, from _καταλέγω_, to write down, signifies a written enumeration. _Register_, from _re_, back, _gerere_ (past participle _gestum)_, to bring, signifies something brought back, a record returned by a messenger or official.  
A collection of objects brought into some kind of order is the common idea included in the signification of these terms. The contents and disposition of a _list_ is the most simple; it consists of little more than names arranged under one another in a long, narrow line, as a _list_ of words, a _list_ of plants and flowers, a _list_ of voters, a _list_ of visits, a _list_ of deaths, of births, of marriages: _roll_, which is figuratively put for the contents of a _roll_, is a _list rolled_ up for convenience, as a long _roll_ of saints: _catalogue_ involves more details than a simple _list;_ it specifies not only names, but dates, qualities, and circumstances. A _list_ of books contains their titles; a _catalogue_ of books contains an enumeration of their size, price, number of volumes, edition, etc.; a _roll_ of saints simply specifies their names; a _catalogue_ of saints enters into particulars of their ages, deaths, etc.: a _register_ contains more than either, for it contains events, with dates, actors, etc., in all matters of public interest.

**LITTLE, SMALL, DIMINUTIVE.**  
_Little_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _lytel_, from a Teutonic base meaning to stoop. For _small_ see [atomic](entry://atomic). _Diminutive_ comes from Latin _minus_, and signifies made less. What is _little_ is so in the ordinary sense in respect to size; it is properly opposed to great: the _small_ is that which is less than others in point of bulk; it is opposed to the large: the _diminutive_ is that which is less than it ought to be; as a person is said to be _diminutive_ in stature who is below the ordinary stature.  
In the moral application, _little_ is frequently used in a bad sense, _small_ and _diminutive_ may be extended to other than physical objects without any change in their signification.

####livelihood 
**LIVELIHOOD, LIVING, SUBSISTENCE, MAINTENANCE, SUPPORT, SUSTENANCE.**  
The means of _living_ or supporting life is the idea common to all these terms, which vary according to the circumstances of the individual and the nature of the object which constitutes the means. _Livelihood_ was originally _livelode_, literally _life-leading_ — from Anglo-Saxon _lif_, life, and _lad_, a way, literally a _leading. Subsistence_ comes from Latin _sub_, under, and _sistere_, to cause to stand — meaning that which bears one up. _Support_, from _sub_ and _portare_, to bear, and _sustenance_, from sub and _tenere_, to hold, have similar origins. _Maintenance_ comes from _manus_, hand, and _tenere_, to hold, and signifies to hold in hand, to control and support. A _livelihood_ is that which is sought after by the day; a laborer earns a _livelihood_ by the sweat of his brow: a _subsistence_ is obtained by irregular efforts of various descriptions; beggars meet with so much that they obtain something better than a precarious and scanty _subsistence: living_ is obtained by more respectable and less severe efforts than the former two; tradesmen obtain a good _living_ by keeping shops; artists procure a _living_ by the exercise of their talents; _maintenance, support_, and _sustenance_ differ from the other three, inasmuch as they do not comprehend what one gains by one's own efforts, but by the efforts of others: _maintenance_ is that which is permanent: it supplies the place of _living: support_ may be casual and vary in degree: the object of most public charities is to afford a _maintenance_ to such as cannot obtain a _livelihood_ or _living_ for themselves; is the business of the parish to give _support_, in time of sickness and distress, to all who are legal parishioners. _Maintenance_ and _support_ are always granted; but _sustenance_ is that which is taken or received: the former comprehend the means of obtaining food; _sustenance_ comprehends that which sustains the body and supplies the place of food. 

####lively 
**LIVELY, SPRIGHTLY, VIVACIOUS, SPORTIVE, MERRY, JOCUND.**  
The activity of the heart when it beats high with a sentiment of gayety is strongly depicted by all these terms: the _lively_ is the most general and literal in its signification; life, as a moving or active principle, is supposed to be inherent in spiritual as well as material bodies; the feeling, as well as the body which has a power of moving arbitrarily of itself, is said to have life; and in whatever object this is wanting, this object is said to be dead: in like manner, according to the degree or circumstances under which this moving principle displays itself, the object is denominated _lively_, that is, having life. _Sprightly_, originally _spritely_, from Latin _spiritus_, spirit, signifies full of spirit or the active breath of life; and _vivacious_, in Latin _vivax_, from _vivere_, to live, is the same as _lively. Liveliness_ is the property of childhood, youth, or even maturer age; _sprightliness_ is the peculiar property of youth; _vivacity_ is a quality compatible with the sobriety of years: an infant shows itself to be _lively_ or otherwise in a few months after its birth; a girl, particularly in her early years, affords often a pleasing picture of _sprightliness;_ a _vivacious_ companion recommends himself wherever he goes. _Sportiveness_, that is, fondness of or readiness for sport, is an accompaniment of _liveliness_ or _sprightliness;_ a _sprightly_ child will show its _sprightliness_ by its _sportive_ humor; _mirth, i.e., merriness_ (see **cheerful** under [cheer](entry://cheer)), and _jocundity_, from _jocundus_ or _jucundus_, and _juvo_, to delight or please, signifying the state of being delighted, are the forms of _liveliness_ which display themselves in social life; the former is a familiar quality, more frequently to be discovered in vulgar than in polished society: _jocundity_ is a form of _liveliness_ which poets have ascribed to nymphs and goddesses and other aerial creatures of the imagination. The terms preserve the same sense when applied to the characteristics or actions of persons as when applied to the persons themselves: imagination, wit, conception, representation, and the like are _lively;_ a person's air, manner, look, tone, dance, are _sprightly;_ a conversation, a turn of mind, a society, is _vivacious;_ the muse, the pen, the imagination, are _sportive;_ the meeting, the laugh, the song, the conceit, are _merry;_ the train, the dance, are _jocund._

####living 
**LIVING, BENEFICE.**  
_Living_ signifies, literally, the pecuniary resource by which one lives. _Benefice_, from Late Latin _beneficium_, based on classical _benefacio_, signifies whatever one obtains as a benefit: the former is applicable to any situation of life, but particularly to that resource which a parish affords to the clergyman; the latter is applicable to no other object: we speak of a _living_ as a resource immediately derived from the parish, in distinction from a curacy, which is derived from an individual; we speak of a _benefice_ in respect to the terms by which it is held, according to the ecclesiastical law: there are many _livings_ which are not _benefices_, although not _vice versa._

**LODGINGS, APARTMENTS.**  
For the derivation of _lodging_ see [harbor](entry://harbor). A _lodging_, or a place to _lodge_ or dwell in, comprehends single rooms, or many rooms, or in fact any place which can be made to serve the purpose; _apartments_ only suites of rooms: _apartments_, therefore, are, in the strict sense, _lodgings;_ but all _lodgings_ are not _apartments:_ on the other hand, the word _lodgings_ is mostly used for rooms that are let out to hire or that serve a temporary purpose; but the word _apartments_ may be applied to the suites of rooms in any large house: hence the word _lodging_ becomes on one ground restricted in its use, and _apartments_ on the other: all _apartments_ to let out for hire are _lodgings_, but _apartments_ not to let out for hire are not _lodgings._

####look 
**LOOK, GLANCE.**  
_Look_ (see [air](entry://air)) is the generic, and _glance_ (see [glance at](entry://glance at)) the specific term; that is to say, a casual or momentary _look:_ a _look_ may be characterized as severe or mild, fierce or gentle, angry or kind: a _glance_ as hasty or sudden, imperfect or slight; so likewise we speak of taking a _look_ or catching a _glance._  
**LOOK, SEE, BEHOLD, VIEW, EYE.** — _Look_, from Anglo-Saxon _locian_, signified originally to peep through a hole. _See_ is in Anglo-Saxon _seon_, to perceive by the eye. _Behold_, compounded of the intensive _be_ and _hold_, signifies to hold or fix the eye on an object. _View_, from Middle French _veuë_, participle of _veoir_, based on the Latin _video_, signifies simply what is seen. To _eye_, from the noun _eye_, Anglo-Saxon _eage_, allied to Latin _oculus_, eye, naturally signifies to examine with the _eye._  
We _look_ voluntarily; we _see_ involuntarily: the eye _sees;_ the person _looks:_ absent-minded people often _see_ things before they are fully conscious that they are at hand: we may _look_ without _seeing_, and we may _see_ without _looking:_ nearsighted people often _look_ at that which is too distant to strike the visual organ. To _behold_ is to _look_ at for a continuance; to _view_ is to _look_ at in all directions; to _eye_ is to _look_ at earnestly and by side glances; that which is _seen_ may disappear in an instant; it may strike the eye and be gone; but what is _looked_ at must make some stay; consequently lightning, and things equally fugitive and rapid in their flight, may be _seen_, but cannot be _looked_ at. To _look_ at is the familiar as well as the general term, in regard to the others; we _look_ at things in general which we wish to _see_, that is, to _see_ clearly, fully, and in all their parts; but we _behold_ that which excites a moral or intellectual interest; we _view_ that which demands intellectual attention; we _eye_ that which gratifies any particular passion: an inquisitive child _looks_ at things which are new to it, but does not _behold_ them; we _look_ at plants or finery or whatever gratifies the senses, but we do not _behold_ them: on the other hand, we _behold_ any spectacle which excites our admiration, our astonishment, our pity, or our love: we _look_ at objects in order to observe their external properties; but we _view_ them in order to find out their component parts, their internal properties, their powers of motion and action, etc.: we _look_ at things to gratify the curiosity of the moment or for mere amusement; but the jealous man _eyes_ his rival in order to mark his movements, his designs, and his successes; the envious man _eyes_ him who is in prosperity, with a malignant desire to _see_ him humbled.  
**LOOK, APPEAR.** — _Look_ is here taken in the neuter sense: in the preceding article it denotes the action of persons striving to see; in the present case it denotes the action of things figuratively striving to be seen. _Appear_, from the Latin _ad_, to, and _parere_, to come in sight, signifies to be present or at hand, within sight.  
The _look_ of a thing implies the impressions which it makes on the senses, that is, the manner in which it _looks;_ its _appearance_ implies the simple act of its coming into sight; the _look_ of anything is therefore characterized as good or bad, mean or handsome, ugly or beautiful; the _appearance_ is characterized as early or late, sudden or unexpected: there is something very unseemly in the _look_ of a clergyman affecting the airs of a fine gentleman; the _appearance_ of the stars in an evening presents an interesting view even to the ordinary beholder. As what _appears_ must _appear_ in some form, the signification of the term has been extended to the manner of the _appearance_, and brought still nearer to _look_ in its application: in this case the term _look_ is rather more familiar than that of _appearance:_ we may speak either of regarding the _look_ or the _appearance_ of a thing, as far as it may impress others; but the latter is less colloquial than the former: a man's conduct is said to _look_ rather than to _appear_ bad; but on the other hand, we say a thing assumes an _appearance_, or has a certain _appearance. Look_ is always employed for what is real; what a thing _looks_ is that which it really is: _appear_, however, sometimes refers not only to what is external, but to what is superficial. If we say a person _looks_ ill, it supposes some positive and unequivocal evidence of illness: if we say he _appears_ to be ill, it is a less positive assertion than the former; it leaves room for doubt and allows the possibility of a mistake. We are at liberty to judge of things by their _looks_, without being accused of want of judgment; but as _appearances_ are said to be deceitful, it becomes necessary to admit them with caution as the rule of our judgment. _Look_ is employed mostly in regard to objects of sense; _appearance_ concerns natural and moral objects indifferently: the sky _looks_ dark; an object _appears_ through a microscope greater than it really is; a person's conduct _appears_ in a more culpable light when interpreted by an enemy.  
**LOOKER-ON, SPECTATOR, BEHOLDER, OBSERVER.** — The _looker-on_ and the _spectator_ are both opposed to the agents or actors in any scene; but the former is still more abstracted from the objects he sees than the latter.  
A _looker-on_ is careless; he has no part, and takes no part, in what he sees; he _looks on_ because the thing is before him and he has nothing else to do: a _spectator_ may likewise be unconcerned, but in general he derives amusement, if nothing else, from what he sees. A clown may be a _looker-on_ who with open mouth gapes at all that is before him, without understanding any part of it, but he who _looks on_ to draw a moral lesson from the whole is in the moral sense not an uninterested _spectator._ The _beholder_ has a nearer interest than the _spectator;_ and the _observer_ has an interest not less near than that of the _beholder_, but somewhat different: the _beholder_ has his feelings roused by what he sees; the _observer_ has his understanding employed in that which passes before him: the _beholder_ indulges himself in contemplation; the _observer_ is busy in making it subservient to some proposed object: every _beholder_ of our Saviour's sufferings and patience was struck with the conviction of His divine character, not excepting even some of those who were His most prejudiced adversaries; every calm _observer_ of our Saviour's words and actions was convinced of His divine mission. 

####loose 
**LOOSE, VAGUE, LAX, DISSOLUTE, LICENTIOUS.**  
_Loose_ is a Scandinavian word. _Vague_, in Latin _vagus_, signifies wandering. _Lax_, in Latin _laxus_, is allied to _lack. Dissolute_, in Latin _dissolutus_, participle of _dissolvere_, signifies _dissolved_ or set free. _Licentious_ signifies having the _license_ or power to do as one pleases (see [leave](entry://leave)).  
_Loose_ is the generic, the rest are specific terms; they are all opposed to that which is bound or adheres closely: _loose_ is employed either for physical, moral, or intellectual objects; _vague_ only for intellectual objects; _lax_ sometimes for what is intellectual, but oftener for the moral; _dissolute_ and _licentious_ only for moral matters: whatever wants a proper connection, or linking together of the parts, is _loose;_ whatever is scattered and remotely separated is _vague:_ a style is _loose_ where the words and sentences are not made to coalesce so as to form a regularly connected series; assertions are _vague_ which have but a remote connection with the subject referred to: by the same rule, _loose_ hints thrown out at random may give rise to speculation and conjecture, but cannot serve as the ground of any conclusion; ignorant people are apt to credit every _vague_ rumor and to communicate it as a certainty. Opinions are _hose_, either inasmuch as they want logical precision or as they fail in moral strictness; suggestions and surmises are induced by the wanderings of the imagination; opinions are _lax_, inasmuch as they have a tendency to lessen the moral obligation or to _loosen_ moralities. A _loose_ man injures himself, but a _lax_ man injures society at large. _Dissoluteness_ is the excess of _looseness; licentiousness_ is the consequence of _laxity_ or the freedom from external constraint. _Looseness_ of character, if indulged, soon sinks into _dissoluteness_ of morals; and _laxity_ of discipline is quickly followed by _licentiousness_ of manners.

####Lord’s Supper 
**LORD’S SUPPER, EUCHARIST, COMMUNION, SACRAMENT**.   
The _Lord's Supper_ is a term of familiar and general use among Christians, as designating in literal terms the supper of our Lord, that is, either the last solemn supper which He took with His disciples previous to His crucifixion or the commemoration of that event which conformably to His commands has been observed by the professors of Christianity. _Eucharist_ is a term of peculiar use among the Roman Catholics, from the Greek _εύχαρίζομαι_, I give thanks, because personal adoration, by way of returning thanks, constitutes in their estimation the chief part of the ceremony. As the social sentiments are kept alive mostly by the common participation of meals, so is brotherly love, the essence of Christian fellowship, cherished and warmed in the highest degree by the common participation in this holy festival: hence, by distinction, it has been denominated the _communion._ As the vows which are made at the altar of our Lord are the most solemn which a Christian can make, comprehending in them the entire devotion of himself to Christ, the general term _sacrament_, signifying an oath, has been employed by way of distinction for this ordinance. The Roman Catholics have employed the same term for six other ordinances; but the Protestants, who attach a similar degree of sacredness to no other than baptism, apply this appellation only to these two. 

####lose 
**LOSE, MISS.**  
_Lose_ is in Middle English _lesen. Miss_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _missan_, to fail to hit, from a base meaning to escape, avoid, etc., allied to Latin _mittere_, to send. To _miss_, probably from the participle _mis_, wrong, signifies to put wrong.  
What is _lost_ is supposed to be entirely and irrevocably gone; but what is _missed_ may be only out of sight or not at hand at the time when it is wanted; health or property may be _lost;_ one _misses_ a coach, or one _misses_ what has been mislaid. Things may be _lost_ in a variety of ways independent of the person _losing;_ but _missing_ is mostly by the instrumentality of the person who _misses. We lose_ an opportunity which it is not in our power to use; we _miss_ an opportunity when we suffer it to pass without using. 

####loss 
**LOSS, DAMAGE, DETRIMENT.**  
_LOSS_ signifies the act of _losing_ or the thing _lost_, from Anglo-Saxon _los_, destruction. _Damage_, in French _dommage_, Latin _damnum_, loss, signifies the thing taken away. _Detriment_ (see **disadvantageous** under [disadvantage](entry://disadvantage)).  
_Loss_ is here the generic term; _damage_ and _detriment_ are species or modes of _loss._ The person sustains the _loss_, the thing suffers the _damage_ or _detriment._ Whatever is gone from us which we wish to retain is a _loss;_ hence we may sustain a _loss_ in our property, in our reputation, in our influence, in our intellect, and every other object of possession: whatever renders an object less serviceable or valuable, by any external violence, is a _damage;_ as a vessel suffers a _damage_ in a storm: whatever is calculated to cross a man's purpose is a _detriment;_ the bare want of a good name may be a _detriment_ to a young tradesman; the want of prudence is always a great _detriment_ to the prosperity of a family. 

####lot 
See [destiny](entry://destiny)

####loud 
**LOUD, NOISY, HIGH-SOUNDING, CLAMOROUS.**  
_Loud_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _hlud_, heard from afar. _Noisy_, from _noise_, is derived from Old French _noise_, a debate or quarrel (something that gives rise to _noise_ in our sense), perhaps from _nausea. High-sounding_ signifies the same as pitched upon an elevated key, so as to make a great noise, to be heard at a distance. _Clamorous_, from the Latin _clamare_, to cry, signifies crying with a loud voice.  
_Loud_ is here the generic term, since it signifies a great sound, which is the idea common to them all. As an epithet for persons, _loud_ is mostly taken in an indifferent sense; all the others are taken for being _loud_ beyond measure; _noisy_ is to be lawlessly and unseasonably _loud; high-sounding_ is to be _loud_ only from the bigness of one's words; _clamorous_ is to be disagreeably and painfully _loud._ We must speak _loudly_ to a deaf person in order to make ourselves heard: children will be _noisy_ at all times if not kept under control: flatterers are always _high-sounding_ in their eulogiums of princes: children will be _clamorous_ for what they want if they expect to get it by dint of _noise;_ they will be turbulent in case of refusal if not under proper discipline. In the improper application _loud_ is taken in as bad a sense as the rest; the _loudest_ praises are the least to be regarded: the applause of a mob is always _noisy; high-sounding_ titles serve only to excite contempt where there is not some corresponding quality: it is the business of a party to be _clamorous_, as that serves the purpose of exciting the ignorant. 

####love 
**LOVE, FRIENDSHIP.**  
_Love_ (see [affection](entry://affection)) is a term of very extensive import; it may be taken either in the most general sense for every strong and passionate attachment or only for such as exist between the sexes, in either of which cases it has features by which it is easily distinguished from _friendship_ — from Anglo-Saxon _freond_, modern English _friend_, from the verb _freogan_, to love.  
_Love_ exists between members of the same family; it springs out of their natural relationship, and is kept alive by their close intercourse and constant interchange of kindnesses: _friendship_ excludes the idea of any tender and natural relationship; nor is it, like _love_, to be found in children, but is confined to maturer years; it is formed by time, by circumstances, by congruity of character and mutual sympathy. _Love_ always operates with ardor; _friendship_ is remarkable for firmness and constancy. _Love_ is peculiar to no station; it is to be found equally among the high and the low, the learned and the unlearned: _friendship_ is of nobler growth; it finds admittance only into minds of a loftier make: it cannot be felt by men of an ordinary stamp. Both _love_ and _friendship_ are gratified by seeking the good of the object; but _love_ is more selfish in its nature than _friendship;_ in indulging another it seeks its own gratification, and when this is not to be obtained it will change into the contrary passion of hatred; _friendship_, on the other hand, is altogether disinterested, it makes sacrifices of every description, and knows no limits to its sacrifice.  
**LOVER, SUITOR, WOOER.** — _Lover_ signifies literally one who _loves_, and is applicable to any object; there are _lovers_ of money and _lovers_ of wine, _lovers_ of things individually and things collectively, that is, _lovers_ of particular women in the good sense, or _lovers_ of women in the bad sense. The _suitor_ (from French _suite_, based ultimately on Latin _sequi_, to follow) is one who _sues_ and strives after a thing; the word is equally undefined as to the object, but may be employed for such as _sue_ for favors from their superiors, or _sue_ for the affections and person of a woman. The _wooer_ (from Anglo-Saxon _wogian_, to court, of obscure origin) is only a species of _lover_, who _woos_ or solicits the kind regards of a female. When applied to the same object, namely, the female sex, the term _lover_ is employed for persons of all ranks, who are equally alive to the tender passion of _love: suitor_ is a title adapted to that class of life where all the genuine affections of human nature are adulterated by a false refinement or entirely lost in other passions of a guilty nature. _Wooer_ is a tender and passionate title, which is adapted to that class of beings that live only in poetry and romance. There is most sincerity in the _lover_, he simply proffers his _love;_ there is most ceremony in the _suitor_, he proffers his _suit;_ there is most ardor in the _wooer_, he makes his vows.

####low 
**LOW, MEAN, ABJECT.**  
_Low_ (see [humble](entry://humble)). _Mean_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _gemœne_, German _gemein_, common. _Abject_, in French _abject_, Latin _abjectus_, from _ab_, down, and _jacere_, to cast, signifies, literally, cast down or brought very low.  
_Low_ is a much stronger term than _mean;_ for what is _low_ stands more directly opposed to what is high, but what is _mean_ is intermediate: the _low_ is applied only to a certain number or description; but _mean_, like common, is applicable to the great bulk of mankind. A man of _low_ extraction falls below the ordinary level; he is opposed to a noble man: a man of _mean_ birth does not rise above the ordinary level; he is upon a level with the majority. _Abject_ expresses more than either of the others, for it denotes the lowest depression in a person's outward condition or position, as _abject_ poverty.  
When employed to designate character, they preserve the same distinction; the _low_ is that which is positively sunk in itself; but the _mean_ is that which is comparatively _low_, in regard to the outward circumstances and relative condition of the individual. Swearing and drunkenness are _low_ vices; boxing and cudgelling are _low_ games; a misplaced economy in people of property is _mean;_ a condescension for our own petty advantages to those who are beneath us is _meanness._ A man is commonly _low_ by birth, education, or habits; but _meanness_ is a defect of nature which debases a person in spite of every external advantage. _Abject_, as a characteristic, is applied particularly to the spirit. Slavery is most apt to produce an _abject_ spirit by depriving a man of the use of those faculties which elevate him above the brutes; poverty, fear, or any base passion may have the same effect.

####madness 
**MADNESS, FRENZY, RAGE, FURY.**  
_Madness_ (see [derangement](entry://derangement)). _Frenzy_, in Latin _phrenesis_, Greek _φρένησις_, from _φρήν_, the midriff, heart, senses, signifies a disordered psychology. _Rage_ is in French _rage_, Latin _rabies_, madness. _Fury_ comes from Latin _furia_, madness.  
_Madness_ and _frenzy_ are used in the physical and moral sense; _rage_ and _fury_ only in the moral sense: in the first case, _madness_ is a confirmed derangement in the organ of thought; _frenzy_ is only a temporary derangement from the violence of any disease or other cause: the former lies in the system, and is, in general, incurable; the latter is only occasional, and yields to the power of medicine. In the moral sense of these terms the cause is put for the effect, that is, _madness_ and _frenzy_ are put for that excessive violence of passion by which they are caused; and as _rage_ and _fury_ are species of this passion, namely, the passion of anger; they are, therefore, to _madness_ and _frenzy_ sometimes as the cause is to the effect: the former, however, are much more violent than the latter, as they altogether destroy the reasoning faculty, which is not expressly implied in the signification of the latter terms. Moral _madness_ differs both in degree and duration from _frenzy:_ if it spring from the extravagance of _rage_, it bursts out into every conceivable extravagance, but is only transitory; if it spring from disappointed love, or any other disappointed passion, it is as permanent as direct physical _madness; frenzy_ is always temporary, but even more impetuous than _madness;_ in the _frenzy_ of despair men commit acts of suicide, in the _frenzy_ of distress and grief people are hurried into many actions fatal to themselves or others.  
_Rage_ refers more immediately to the agitation that exists within the mind; _fury_ refers to that which shows itself outwardly: a person contains or stifles his _rage;_ but his _fury_ breaks out into some external mark of violence: _rage_ will subside of itself; _fury_ spends itself; a person may be choked with _rage_, but his _fury_ finds a vent: an _enraged_ man may be pacified; a _furious_ one is deaf to every remonstrance. _Rage_, when applied to persons, commonly signifies highly inflamed anger; but it may be employed for inflamed passion toward any object which is specified; as a _rage_ for music, a _rage_ for theatrical performances, a fashionable _rage_ for any whim of the day. _Fury_, though commonly signifying _rage_ bursting out, yet may be any impetuous feeling displaying itself in extravagant action; as the divine _fury_ supposed to be produced in the priestess of Apollo by the inspiration of the god, and the bacchanalian _fury_, which expression depicts the influence of wine upon the body and mind. In the improper application, to inanimate objects, the words _rage_ and _fury_ preserve a similar distinction: the _rage_ of the heat denotes the excessive height to which it is risen; the _fury_ of the winds indicates their violent commotion and turbulence; so in like manner the _raging_ of the tempest characterizes figuratively its burning anger; and the _fury_ of the flames marks their impetuous movements, their wild and rapid spread.

####magisterial 
**MAGISTERIAL, MAJESTIC, STATELY, POMPOUS, AUGUST, DIGNIFIED.**  
_Magisterial_, from _magister_, a master, and _majestic_, from _majestas, are_ both derived from _magis_, more, or _major_, greater, that is, more or greater than others; but they differ in this respect, that the _magisterial_ is something assumed, and is therefore often false; the _majestic_ is natural, and consequently always real: an upstart, or an intruder into any high station or office, may put on a _magisterial_ air in order to impose on the multitude; but it will not be in his power to be _majestic_, which never shows itself in a borrowed shape; none but those who have a superiority of character, of birth, or outward station can be _majestic. Stately_ and _pompous_ (see [magnificence](entry://magnificence)) are most nearly allied to _magisterial; august_ (from Augustus, the title of the Roman Cæsars) and _dignified_ to _majestic:_ the former being merely extrinsic and assumed, the latter intrinsic and inherent. _Magisterial_ implies the authority which is assumed; _stately_ regards splendor and rank; _pompous_ regards personal importance, with all the appendage of greatness and power: a person is _magisterial_ in the exercise of his office and the distribution of his commands; he is _stately_ in his ordinary intercourse with his inferiors and equals; he is _pompous_ on particular occasions of appearing in public: a person demands silence in a _magisterial_ tone; he marches forward with a _stately_ air; he comes forward in a _pompous_ manner, so as to strike others with a sense of his importance.  
_Majestic_ is an epithet that characterizes the exterior of an object; _august_ is that which marks an essential characteristic in the object; _dignified_ serves to characterize a person's action as tending to give dignity: a woman's form is termed _majestic_ when it has something imposing in it suited to the condition of majesty or the most elevated station in society; a monarch is entitled _august_ in order to describe the extent of his empire; a public assembly is denominated _august_ to bespeak its high character and its weighty influence in the scale of society; a reply is termed _dignified_ when it upholds the individual and personal character of a man as well as his relative character in the community to which he belongs: the former two of these terms are associated only with grandeur of outward circumstances; the last is applicable to men of all stations who have each in his sphere a _dignity_ to maintain which belongs to man as an independent moral agent.

_Magnificence_, from _magnus_, great, and a weak form of _facere_, to do, signifies doing largely or on a large scale. _Splendor_, in Latin _splendor_, from _splendere_, to shine, signifies brightness of exterior. _Pomp_, in Latin _pompa_, Greek _πομπή_, a procession, from _πέμπειν_, to send, signified a sending, an escorting, which, of course, was usually splendid and gorgeous, because men honored with an escort were usually deemed worthy also of a certain _splendor_ and ceremony in the accoutrements of the escort.  
_Magnificence_ lies not only in the number and extent of the objects presented, but in their degree of richness as to their coloring and quality; _splendor_ is but a characteristic of _magnificence_, attached to such objects as dazzle the eye by the quantity of light or the beauty and strength of coloring; the entertainments of the Eastern monarchs and princes are remarkable for their _magnificence_, from the immense number of their attendants, the crowd of equipages, the size of their palaces, the multitude of costly utensils, and the profusion of viands which constitute the arrangements for the banquet the entertainments of Europeans present much _splendor_, from the richness, the variety, and the brilliancy of dress, of furniture, and all the apparatus of a feast, which the refinements of art have brought to perfection. _Magnificence_ is seldomer unaccompanied with _splendor_ than _splendor_ with _magnificence_, since quantity, as well as quality, is essential to the one; but quality more than quantity is an essential to the other: a large army drawn up in battle array is a _magnificent_ spectacle, from the immensity of their numbers and the order of their disposition; it will in all probability be a _splendid_ scene if there be much richness in the dresses; the _pomp_ will here consist in such large bodies of men acting by one impulse and directed by one will, hence military _pomp;_ it is the appendage of power when displayed to public view: on particular occasions a monarch seated on his throne, surrounded by his courtiers and attended by his guards, is said to appear with _pomp._

####make 
**MAKE, FORM, PRODUCE, CREATE.**  
The idea of giving birth to a thing is common to all these terms, which vary in the circumstances of the action: to _make_ (see [act](entry://act)) is the most general and unqualified term; to _form_ (see [form](entry://form)) signifies to give a _form_ to a thing, that is, to _make_ it after a given _form;_ to _produce_ (see [afford](entry://afford)) is to bring forth into the light, to call into existence; to _create_ (see [cause](entry://cause)) is to bring into existence by an absolute exercise of power; to _make_ is the simplest action of all, and comprehends a simple combination by the smallest efforts; to _form_ requires care and attention and greater efforts; to _produce_ requires time and also labor: whatever is put together so as to become another thing is _made;_ a chair or a table is _made:_ whatever is put into any distinct _form_ is _formed;_ the potter _forms_ the clay into an earthen vessel: whatever emanates from a thing so as to become a distinct object is _produced;_ fire is often _produced_ by the violent friction of two pieces of wood with each other. The process of _making_ is always performed by some conscious agent, who employs either mechanical means or the simple exercise of power: a bird _makes_ its nest; man _makes_ various things by the exercise of his understanding and his limbs; the Almighty has _made_ everything by His word. The process of _forming_ does not always require a conscious agent; things are _formed_ of themselves or they are _formed_ by the active operations of other bodies; melted lead, when thrown into water, will _form_ itself into various little bodies; hard substances are _formed_ in the human body, which give rise to the disease termed the gravel. What is _produced_ is oftener _produced_ by the process of nature than by any express design; the earth _produces_ all kinds of vegetables from seed; animals, by a similar process, _produce_ their young. _Create_, in this natural sense of the term, is employed as the act of an intelligent being and that of the Supreme Being only; it is the act of _making_ by a simple effort of power, without the use of materials and without any process. Hence it has been extended in its application to the _making_ of anything by an immediate exercise of power. The _creative_ power of the human mind is a faint image of that Power which brought everything into existence out of nothing.  
They are all employed in the moral sense and with a similar distinction: _make_ is indefinite; we may _make_ a thing that is difficult or easy, simple or complex; we may _make_ a letter or _make_ a poem; we may _make_ a word or _make_ a sentence. To _form_ is the work either of intelligence or of circumstances: education has much to do in _forming_ the habits, but nature has more to do in _forming_ the disposition and the mind altogether; sentiments are frequently _formed_ by young people before they have sufficient maturity of thought and knowledge to justify them in coming to any decision. To _produce_ is the effect of great mental exertion, or it is the natural operation of things: no industry could ever _produce_ a poem or a work of the imagination, but a history or a work of science may be _produced_ by the force of mere labor. All things, both in the moral and intellectual world, are linked together upon the same principle of cause and effect by which one thing is the _producer_ and the other the thing _produced:_ quarrels _produce_ hatred, and kindness _produces_ love, as heat _produces_ inflammation and fever, or disease _produces_ death. What is _created_ is not made by any natural process, but is called into existence by the _creating_ power; small matters _create_ jealousies in jealous minds. 

####malady 
See [disorder](entry://disorder)

####malediction 
**MALEDICTION, CURSE, IMPRECATION, EXECRATION, ANATHEMA.**  
_Malediction_, from Latin _male_, ill, and _dicere_, to say, signifies a saying ill, that is, declaring an evil wish against a person. _Curse_, Anglo-Saxon _cursian_, is the native English term corresponding to _malediction. Imprecation_, from Latin _in_, in, and _precari_, to pray, signifies a praying down evil upon a person. _Execration_, from the Latin _execror_, that is, _e sacris excludtre_, signifies the same as to excommunicate, with every form of solemn _imprecation. Anathema_, in Greek _ανάθεμα_, signifies a setting up, hence a devotion, a curse, and thus a putting out of a religious community as a penance.  
The _malediction_ is the most indefinite and general term, signifying simply the declaration of evil; _curse_ is a solemn denunciation of evil: the former is employed mostly by men; the latter by some superior being as well as by men: the rest are species of the _curse_ pronounced only by men. The _malediction_ is caused by simple anger; the _curse_ is occasioned by some grievous offence: men, in the heat of their passions, will utter _maledictions_ against any object that offends them; God pronounced a _curse_ upon Adam and all his posterity, after the fall.  
The term _curse_ differs in the degree of evil pronounced or wished; _imprecation_ and _execration_ always imply some positive great evil, and, in fact, as much evil as can be conceived by man in his anger; the _anathema_ concerns the evil which is pronounced according to the canon law, by which a man is not only put out of the Church, but held up as an object of offence. The _malediction_ is altogether an unallowed expression of private resentment; the _curse_ was admitted, in some cases, according to the Mosaic law; and that, as well as the _anathema_, at one time formed a part of the ecclesiastical discipline of the Christian Church; the _imprecation_ formed a part of the heathen ceremony of religion; but the _execration_ is always the informal expression of the most violent personal anger. 

####malefactor

####malevolent 
**MALEVOLENT, MALICIOUS, MALIGNANT.**  
These words have all their derivation from _malus_, bad, that is, _malevolent_, wishing ill; _malicious_ (see **malice** under [malevolent](entry://malevolent)), having _malice;_ and _malignant_, from _malus_ and _gignere_, to be born, having an inborn disposition that is bad.  
_Malevolence_ has a deep root in the heart and is a settled part of the character; we denominate the person _malevolent_ to designate the ruling temper of his mind: _maliciousness_ may be applied as an epithet to particular parts of a man's character or conduct; one may have a _malicious_ joy or pleasure in seeing the distresses of another: _malignity_ is not so often employed _to_ characterize the person as the thing; the _malignity_ of a design is estimated by the degree of mischief which was intended to be done.  
**MALICE, RANCOR, SPITE, GRUDGE, PIQUE.** — _Malice_, in Latin _malitia_, from _malus_, bad, signifies the very essence of badness lying in the heart; _rancor_ (see **hatred** under [hate](entry://hate)) is only continued _hatred;_ the former requires no external cause to provoke it, it is inherent in the mind; the latter must be caused by some personal offence. _Malice_ is properly the love of evil for evil's sake, and is, therefore, confined to no number or quality of objects, and limited by no circumstance; _rancor_ depends upon external objects for its existence, and is confined to such objects only as are liable to cause displeasure or anger; _malice_ will impel a man to do mischief to those who have not injured him and are perhaps strangers to him; _rancor_ can subsist only between those who have had sufficient connection to be at variance.  
_Spite_, from Old French _despit_, from Latin _de_, down, and a weakened form of _specere_, to look — to look down on, to despise — denotes a petty kind of _malice_, or disposition to offend another in trifling matters; it may be in the temper of the person, or it may have its source in some external provocation: children often show their _spite_ to one another.  
_Grudge_, from Old French _groucher_, to murmur, from an imitative base _gru;_ and _pique_, from _pike_, denoting the prick of a pointed instrument, are employed for that particular state of _rancorous_ or _spiteful_ feeling which is occasioned by personal offences: the _grudge_ is that which has long existed; the _pique_ is that which is of recent date; a person is said to owe another a _grudge_ for having done him an injury; or he is said to show _pique_ to another who has made him an affront.

**MANLY, MANFUL.**  
_Manly_, or like a man, is opposed to juvenile, and of course applied properly to youths; but _manful_, or full of manhood, is opposed to effeminate and is applicable more properly to grown persons: a premature _manliness_ in young persons is hardly less unseemly than a want of _manfulness_ in one who is called upon to display his courage.

####manners 
**MANNERS, MORALS.**  
_Manners_ concern the minor forms of acting with others and toward others; _morals_ include the important duties of life: _manners_ have therefore been denominated minor _morals._ By attention to good _manners_ we render ourselves good companions; by an observance of good _morals_ we become good members of society: in the former instance we gain the good-will of others, in the latter their esteem. The _manners_ of a child are of more or less importance, according to his station in life; his _morals_ cannot be attended to too early, let his station be what it may.

####maritime 
**MARITIME, MARINE, NAVAL, NAUTICAL.**  
_Maritime_ and _marine_, from the Latin _mare_, sea, cognate with English _mere_, signifies belonging to the sea; _naval_, from _navis_, a ship, signifies belonging to a ship; and _nautical_, from _nauta_, a sailor, signifies belonging to a sailor or to navigation. Countries and places are denominated _maritime_ from their proximity to the sea or their great intercourse by sea; hence England is called the most _maritime_ nation in Europe. _Marine_ is a technical term, employed by persons in office, to denote that which is officially transacted with regard to the sea in distinction from what passes on land; hence we speak of the _marines_ as a species of soldiers acting by sea, as contrasted with the _maritime_ society: or of _marine_ stores. _Naval_ is another term of art as opposed to military, and used in regard to the arrangements of government or commerce: hence we speak of _naval_ affairs, _naval_ officers, _naval_ tactics, and the like. _Nautical_ is a scientific term connected with the science of navigation or the management of vessels: hence we talk of _nautical_ instruction, of _nautical_ calculations. The _maritime_ laws of England are essential for the preservation of the _naval_ power which it has so justly acquired. The _marine_ of England is one of its glories. The _naval_ administration is one of the most important branches of our government in the time of war. _Nautical_ tables and a _nautical_ almanac have been expressly formed for the benefit of all who apply themselves to _nautical_ subjects. 

####mark 
**MARK, PRINT, IMPRESSION, STAMP.**  
_Mark_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _mearc_, possibly allied to _mearc_, signifying a boundary or limit, though this seems to be a different word. _Print_ and _impression_, both from the Latin _premere_, to press, signify the visible effect produced by _printing_ or pressing. _Stamp_ signifies the effect produced by _stamping_, from Anglo-Saxon _stempan_, to stamp on with the feet.  
The word _mark_ is the most general in sense: whatever alters the external face of an object is a _mark;_ a _print_ is some specific _mark_, or a figure drawn upon the surface of an object; an _impression_ is the _mark_ pressed either upon or into a body; a _stamp_ is the _mark_ that is _stamped_ in or upon the body. The _mark_ is confined to no size, shape, or form; the _print_ is a _mark_ that represents an object: the _mark_ may consist of a spot, a line, a stain, or a smear; but a _print_ describes a given object, as a house, a man, etc. A _mark_ is either a protuberance or a depression; an _impression_ is always a sinking in of the object: a hillock or a hole are both _marks;_ but the latter is properly the _impression:_ the _stamp_ is an _impression_ made in a specific maimer and for a specific object, as the _stamp_ of a seal on wax. The _mark_ is occasioned by every sort of action, gentle or violent, artificial or natural; by the voluntary act of a person, or the unconscious act of inanimate bodies, by means of compression or friction, by a touch or a blow, and the like: all the others are occasioned by one or more of these modes. The _print_ is occasioned by artificial means of compression, as when the _print_ of letters or pictures is made on paper; or by accidental and natural compression, as when the _print_ of the hand is made on the wall, or the _print_ of the foot is made on the ground. The _impression_ is made by means more or less violent, as when an _impression_ is made upon wood by the axe or hammer; or by gradual and natural means, as by the dripping of water on stone. The _stamp_ is made by means of direct pressure with an artificial instrument.  
_Mark_ is of such universal application that it is confined to no objects whatever, either in the natural or moral world; _print_ is mostly applied to material objects, the face of which undergoes a lasting change, as the _printing_ made on paper or wood; _impression_ is more commonly applied to such natural objects as are particularly solid; _stamp_ is generally applied to paper or still softer and more yielding bodies. _Impression_ and _stamp_ have both a moral application: events or speeches make an _impression_ on the mind; things bear a certain _stamp_ which bespeaks their origin. Where the passions have obtained an ascendency, the occasional good _impressions_ which are produced by religious observances but too frequently die away; the Christian religion carries with itself the _stamp_ of truth.  
**MARK, SIGN, NOTE, SYMPTOM, TOKEN, INDICATION.** — _Mark_ (see above). _Sign_, in Latin _signum_, signifies the thing that points out. _Symptom_, in Latin _symptoma_, Greek _σύμπτωμα_, from _πίπτειν_, to fall out in accordance, signifies what presents itself to confirm one's opinion. _Token_ (see [betoken](entry://betoken)). _Indication_, in Latin _indicatio_, from _indicare_, to point out, signifies the thing which points out.  
The idea of an external object which serves to direct the observer is common to all these terms; the difference consists in the objects that are employed. Anything may serve as a _mark_, a stroke, a dot, a stick set up, and the like; it serves simply to guide the senses; the _sign_ is something more complex; it consists of a figure or representation of some object, as the twelve _signs_ of the zodiac, or the _signs_ which are affixed to houses of entertainment, or to shops. _Marks_ are arbitrary; every one chooses his _mark_ at pleasure: _signs_ have commonly a connection with the object that is to be observed: a house, a tree, a letter, or any external object may be chosen as a _mark:_ but a tobacconist chooses the _sign_ of a redman; the innkeeper chooses the head of the reigning prince. _Marks_ serve in general simply to aid the memory in distinguishing the situation of objects or the particular circumstances of persons or things, as the _marks_ which are set up in a garden to distinguish the ground that is occupied; they may, therefore, be private and known only to the individual that makes them, as the private _marks_ by which a tradesman distinguishes his prices: they may likewise be changeable and fluctuating, according to the humor and convenience of the maker, as the private _marks_ which are employed by the military on guard. _Signs_, on the contrary, serve to direct the understanding; they have either a natural or an artificial resemblance to the object to be represented; they are consequently chosen, not by the will of one, but by the universal consent of a body; they are not chosen for the moment, but for a permanency, as in the case of language, either oral or written, in the case of the zodiacal _signs_, or the _signs_ of the cross, the algebraical _signs_, and the like. It is clear, therefore, that many objects may be both a _mark_ and a _sign_, according to the above illustration: the cross which is employed in books, by way of reference to notes, is a _mark_ only, because it serves merely to guide the eye or assist the memory; but the figure of the cross, when employed in reference to the cross of our Saviour, is a _sign_, inasmuch as it conveys a distinct idea of something else to the mind; so likewise little strokes over letters, or even letters themselves, may merely be _marks_, while they point out only a difference between this or that letter, this or that object; but this same stroke becomes a _sign_ if, as in the first declension of Latin nouns, it is a _sign_ of the ablative case; and a single letter affixed to different parcels is merely a _mark_ so long as it simply serves this purpose; but the same letter, or suppose it were a word, is a _sign_ when it is used as a _sign._ A _mark_ may be something accidental, and mean nothing; but a _sign_ is that to which a meaning is always given: there may be _marks_ on a wall occasioned by the elements or otherwise, but a _sign_ is always the _sign_ of something: a _mark_, if it consist of a sensible object, is only visible, but _signs_ may be the object of hearing, smell, or any other sense: many things, therefore, may be _signs_ which are not _marks;_ when words are spoken and not written they are _signs_ and not _marks;_ and in like manner, the cross made on the forehead of a child in baptism is a _sign_, but not a _mark._  
When _mark_ and _sign_ are both taken to denote something by which one forms a judgment, the former serves either to denote that which has been or which is, the latter to designate that which is or will be, as persons bear the _marks_ of age, or the _marks_ of violence; or we may judge by the _marks_ of a person's foot that some one has been walking in a particular place; hoarseness is a _sign_ that a person has a cold; when mariners meet with certain birds at sea, they consider them as a _sign_ that land is near at hand.  
So likewise in application to moral objects or matters of a purely intellectual nature; as a _mark_ of honor, or a _mark_ of distinction; an outward and visible _sign_ of an inward and spiritual grace.  
So likewise in application to objects which serve as characteristics of the person, the _mark_ illustrates the spring of the action; the _sign_ shows the state of the mind or sentiments; it is a _mark_ of folly or weakness in a man to yield himself implicitly to the guidance of an interested friend; tears are not always a _sign_ of repentance.  
_Note_ is rather a _sign_ than a _mark;_ but it is properly the _sign_ which consists of _marks_, as a _note_ of admiration (!); or, in the moral sense, the _sign_ by which the object is known; as persons of _note_, that is, which have a _note_ upon them, or that by which they are known.  
_Symptom_ is rather a _mark_ than a _sign;_ it explains the cause or origin of complaints by the appearances they assume, and is employed as a technical term only in the science of medicine: as a foaming at the mouth and an abhorrence of chink are _symptoms_ of canine madness; motion and respiration are _signs_ of life; but it may likewise be used figuratively in application to moral objects.  
_Token_ is a species of _mark_ in the moral sense, _indication_ a species of _sign:_ a _mark_ shows what is, a _token_ serves to keep in mind what has been: a _gift_ to a friend is a _mark_ of one's affection and esteem: if it be permanent in its nature it becomes a _token;_ friends who are in close intercourse have perpetual opportunities of showing each other _marks_ of then regard by reciprocal acts of courtesy and kindness; when they separate for any length of time they commonly leave some _token_ of their tender sentiments in each other's hands, as a pledge of what shall be as well as an evidence of what has been.  
_Sign_, as it respects _indication_, is said in abstract and general propositions: _indication_ itself is employed only for the _sign_ given by any individual; it bespeaks the act of the persons: but the _sign_ is only the face or appearance of the thing. When a man does not live consistently with the profession which he holds, it is a _sign_ that his religion is built on a wrong foundation; parents are gratified when they observe the slightest _indications_ of genius or goodness in their children.  
**MARK, TRACE, VESTIGE, FOOTSTEP, TRACK.** — The word _mark_ has already been considered at large in the preceding article, but it will admit of further illustration when taken in the sense of that which is visible, and serves to show the existing state of things; _mark_ is here, as before, the most general and unqualified term; the other terms varying in the circumstances or manner of the _mark. Trace_, Middle French _tracer_, to follow, comes ultimately from Latin _trahere_, to drag. _Vestige_, in Latin _vestigium_, signifies, literally, a print of the foot. _Footstep_ is taken for the place in which the foot has stepped, or the _mark_ made by that step. _Track_, French _trac_, a beaten way, comes from a Teutonic verb meaning to scrape or shove.  
The _mark_ is said of a fresh and un interrupted line: the _trace_ is said of that which is broken by time: a carriage in driving along the sand leaves _marks_ of the wheels, but in a short time all _traces_ of its having been there will be lost; a _mark_ is produced by the action of bodies on one another in every possible form; the spilling of a liquid may leave a _mark_ on the floor; the blow of a stick leaves a _mark_ on the body; but the _trace_ is a _mark_ produced only by bodies making a progress or proceeding in a continued course: the ship that cuts the waves and the bird that cuts the air leave no _trace_ of their course behind; so men pass their lives, and after death leave no _traces_ that they ever were. The _vestige_ is a species of _mark_ or _trace_ caused by the feet of men, or, which is the same thing, by the works of active industry; as the _vestige_ of buildings: there are _traces_ of the Roman roads still visible in England; there are many _vestiges_ of Roman temples in Italy.  
In an extended and moral application they are similarly distinguished. The _mark_ serves to denote as well that which is as that which has been; as _marks_ of desolation, or _marks_ of antiquity: _trace_ and _vestige_ show the remains of something that has been; the former in reference to matters of intellectual research generally, the latter in reference to that which has been built up or pulled down, as there are _traces_ of a universal affinity in all known languages; there are _vestiges_ of ancient customs in different parts of England.  
_Footstep_ is employed only for the _steps_ of an individual: the _track_ is made by the _steps_ of many; it is the line which has been beaten out or made by stamping: the _footstep_ is now commonly and properly employed only for men and brutes; but the _track_ is applied to inanimate objects, as the wheel of a carriage. When Cacus took away the oxen of Hercules, he dragged them backward that they might not be _traced_ by their _footsteps:_ a _track_ of blood from the body of a murdered man may sometimes lead to the detection of the murderer.  
In the metaphorical application they do not signify a _mark_, but a course of conduct; the former implies one's moral feelings or mode of dealing; the latter one's mechanical and habitual manner of acting: the former is the consequence of having the same principles; the latter proceeds from imitation or constant repetition. A good son will walk in the _footsteps_ of a good father. In the management of business, it is rarely wise in a young man to leave the _track_ which has been _marked_ out for him by his superiors in age and experience.  
**MARK, BADGE, STIGMA.** — _Mark_ is still the general and the two others specific terms; they are employed for whatever serves to characterize persons externally, or betoken any part either of their character or circumstances: _mark_ is employed either in a good, bad, or indifferent sense; _badge_ in an indifferent one; _stigma_ in a bad sense: a thing may either be a _mark_ of honor, of disgrace, or of simple distinction; a _badge_ is a _mark_ simply of distinction; the _stigma_ is a _mark_ of disgrace. The _mark_ is that which is conferred upon a person for his merits, as medals, stars, and ribbons are bestowed by princes upon meritorious officers and soldiers; or the _mark_ attaches to a person, or is affixed to him, in consequence of his demerits; as a low situation in his class is a _mark_ of disgrace to a scholar; or a fool's cap is a _mark_ of ignominy affixed to idlers and dunces; or a brand in the forehead is a _mark_ of ignominy for criminals: the _badge_ is that which is voluntarily assumed by one's self according to established custom; it consists of dress by which the office, station, and even religion of a particular community is distinguished: as the gown and wig are the _badge_ of the legal profession; the gown and surplice that of clerical men: the uniform of charity children is the _badge_ of their condition; the peculiar habit of the Quakers, or the Friends, is the _badge_ of their religion: the _stigma_ consists not so much of what is openly imposed upon a person as what falls upon him in the judgment of others; it is the black _mark_ which is set upon a person by the public, and is consequently the strongest of all _marks_, and one which every one most dreads and every good man seeks least to deserve.  
**MARK, BUTT.** — The word _mark_ has this additional meaning in common with the word _butt_, that it implies an object aimed at: the _mark_ is literally a _mark_ that is said to be shot at by the _marksman_ with a gun or a bow.  
It is also metaphorically employed for the man who by his peculiar characteristics makes himself the object of notice; he is the _mark_ at which every one's looks and thoughts are directed: the _butt_, derived through French from an Old Low German word meaning to beat, allied to English _beat_, is a species of _mark_ in this metaphorical sense; but the former calls forth only general observation, the latter provokes the laughter and jokes of every one. Whoever renders himself conspicuous by his eccentricities, either in his opinions or his actions, must not complain if he become a _mark_ for the derision of the public: it is a man's misfortune rather than his fault if he become the _butt_ of a company who are rude and unfeeling enough to draw their pleasures from another's pain.  
**MARK, NOTE, NOTICE.** — _Mark_ is here taken in the intellectual sense, fixing as it were a _mark_ upon a thing so as to keep it in mind, which is in fact to fix one's attention upon it in such a manner as to be able to distinguish it by its characteristic qualities: to _mark_ is therefore altogether an intellectual act: to _note_ has the same end as that of _marking_, namely, to aid the memory, but one _notes_ a thing by making a written _note_ of it; this is therefore a mechanical act: to _notice_, on the other hand, from _notitia_, knowledge, is a conscious operation, signifying to bring to one's knowledge, perception, or understanding by the use of our senses. We _mark_ and _note_ that which particularly interests us: the former is that which serves a present purpose; _notice_ that which may be of use in future. The impatient lover _marks_ the hours until the time arrives for meeting his mistress: travellers _note_ whatever strikes them of importance to be remembered when they return home: _notice_, which is a species of noting in small matters, may serve either for the present or the future; we may _notice_ things merely by way of amusement, as a child will _notice_ the actions of animals; or we may _notice_ a thing for the sake of bearing it in mind, as a person _notices_ a particular road when he wishes to return by the same way.

####marriage 
**MARRIAGE, WEDDING, NUPTIALS.**  
_Marriage_, from to _marry_, denotes the act of _marrying; wedding_ and _nuptials_ denote the ceremony of being _married._ To _marry_ is based on Latin _maritus_, from a root found also in _masculine_, signifying a man, and means to be joined to a male; hence _marriage_ comprehends the act of choosing and being legally bound to a man or a woman; _wedding_, from _wed_, and the Anglo-Saxon _weddian_, to promise or betroth, implies the ceremony of _marrying_, inasmuch as it is binding upon the parties. _Nuptials_ comes ultimately from _nupta_, participle of the Latin _nubere_, to veil, because the Roman ladies were veiled at the time of _marriage:_ hence it has been put for the whole ceremony itself. _Marriage_ is an institution which, by those who have been blessed with the light of Divine Revelation, has always been considered as sacred: with some persons, particularly among the lower orders of society, the day of their _wedding_ is converted into a day of riot and intemperance: among the Roman Catholics in England it has been the practice to have their _nuptials_ solemnized by a priest of then own persuasion as well as by the Protestant clergyman.  
It is customary among many Italians in the United States to have a civil marriage first and a religious one later, the couple living apart in the interval.  
**MARRIAGE, MATRIMONY, WEDLOCK.** — _Marriage_ is oftener an act than a state: _matrimony_ and _wedlock_ both describe states.  
_Marriage_ is taken in the sense of an act when we speak of the laws of _marriage_, the day of one's _marriage_, the congratulations upon one's _marriage_, a happy or unhappy _marriage_, the fruits of one's _marriage_, and the like; it is taken in the sense of a state when we speak of the pleasures or pains of _marriage;_ but in this latter case _matrimony_, which signifies a _married_ life abstractedly from all agents or acting persons, is preferable; so likewise, to think of _matrimony_, and to enter into the holy state of _matrimony_, are expressions founded upon the signification of the term. As _matrimony_ is derived from _mater_, a mother, because _married_ women are in general mothers, it has particular reference to the domestic state of the two parties; broils are but too frequently the fruits of _matrimony_, yet there are few cases in which they might not be obviated by the good sense of those who are engaged in them. Hasty _marriages_ cannot be expected to produce happiness; young people who are eager for _matrimony_ before they are fully aware of its consequences will purchase their experience at the expense of their peace. _Wedlock_ is the Old English word for _matrimony_, and is in consequence admitted in law, when one speaks of children born in _wedlock;_ conformably to its derivation, it has a reference to the bond of union which follows the _marriage:_ hence one speaks of living happily in a state of _wedlock_, of being joined in holy _wedlock._

####martial 
**MARTIAL, WARFARE, WARLIKE, MILITARY, SOLDIER-LIKE.**  
_Martial_, from Mars, the god of war, is the Latin term for belonging to war: _warlike_ signifies, literally, like _war_ (Old French _werre_, Modern French _guerre_, from Old High German _werra_, broil, confusion, allied to English _worse)._ In sense these terms approach so near to each other that they may be easily admitted to supply each other's place; but custom, the lawgiver of language, has assigned an office to each that makes it not altogether indifferent how they are used. _Warfare_, from _war_ and the Anglo-Saxon verb _faran_, modern _fare_, to go, means an expedition of war; hence is the carrying on of war, either by land or sea or both. It is also improperly applied to strife between political and other factions. _Martial_ is both a technical and a more comprehensive term than _warlike;_ on the other hand, _warlike_ designates the temper of the individual more than _martial:_ we speak of _martial_ array, _martial_ preparations, _martial_ law, a court _martial;_ but of a _warlike_ nation, meaning a nation which is fond of war; a _warlike_ spirit or temper, also a _warlike_ appearance, inasmuch as the temper is visible in the air and carriage of a man. _Military_, from _miles_, signifies belonging to a soldier, and_ soldier-like_, like a soldier _(soldier_ being derived from Late Latin _soldum_, pay, from _solidus_, originally an adjective meaning hard; then "hard cash" or money, and signifying originally one who fights for money). _Military_, in comparison with _martial_, is a term of particular import, _martial_ having always a reference to war in general: and _military_ to the proceedings consequent upon that: hence we speak of _military_ in distinction from naval, as _military_ expeditions, _military_ movements, and the like; but in characterizing the men we should say that they had a _martial_ appearance; but of a particular place that it had a _military_ appearance, if there were many soldiers. _Military_, compared with _soldier-like_, is used for the body, and the latter for the individual. The whole army is termed the _military:_ the conduct of an individual is _soldier-like_ or otherwise.

####matter 
**MATTER, MATERIALS, SUBJECT.**  
_Matter_ and _materials_ are both derived from the same source, namely, the Latin _materia_, stuff for building. _Subject_, in Latin _subjectum_, participle of _subicere_, to he under, signifies the thing lying under and forming the foundation.  
_Matter_, in the physical application, is taken for all that composes the sensible world, in distinction from that which is spiritual or discernible only by the thinking faculty; hence _matter_ is always opposed to mind. In regard to _materials_, it is taken in an indivisible as well as a general sense; the whole universe is said to be composed of _matter_, though not of _materials:_ on the other hand, _materials_ consist of those particular parts of _matter_ which serve for the artificial production of objects; and _mailer_ is said of those things which are the natural parts of the universe: a house, a table, and a chair consist of _materials_, because they are works of art; but a plant, a tree, an animal body, consist of _matter_, because they are the productions of nature.  
The distinction of these terms in their moral application is very similar; the _matter_ which composes a moral discourse is what emanates from the author; but the _materials_ are those with which one is furnished by others. The style of some writers is so indifferent that it disgraces the _matter_ by the manner; periodical writers are furnished with _materials_ for their productions by the daily occurrences in the political and moral world. Writers of dictionaries endeavor to compress as much _matter_ as possible into a small space; they draw their _materials_ from every other writer.  
_Matter_ seems to bear the same relation to _subject_ as the whole does to any particular part: the _subject_ is the groundwork of the _matter;_ the _matter_ is that which derives from the subject: the _matter_ is that which we get by the force of invention; the _subject_ is that which offers itself to notice: many persons may, therefore, have a _subject_ who have no _matter_, that is, nothing in their own minds which they can offer by way of illustrating this _subject:_ but it is not possible to have _matter_ without a _subject;_ hence the word _matter_ is taken for the substance and for that which is substantial; the _subject_ is taken for that which engages the attention: we speak of a _subject_ of conversation and _matter_ for deliberation; a _subject_ of inquiry, a _matter_ of curiosity. Nations in a barbarous state afford but little _matter_ worthy to be recorded in history; people who live a secluded life and in a contracted sphere have but few _subjects_ to occupy their attention.

####maxim 
**MAXIM, PRECEPT, RULE, LAW.**  
_Maxim_ (see [axiom](entry://axiom)) is a moral truth that carries its own weight with itself. _Precept_ (see [command](entry://command)), _rule_ (see [guide](entry://guide)), and _law_ (see [lawful](entry://lawful)), signifying the thing laid down, all borrow their weight from some external circumstance: the _precept_ derives its authority from the individual delivering it; in this manner the _precepts_ of our Saviour have a weight which gives them a decided superiority over everything else: the _rule_ acquires a worth from its fitness for guiding us in our proceeding: the _law_, which is a species of _rule_, derives its weight from the sanction of power. _Maxims_ are often _precepts_, inasmuch as they are communicated to us by our parents; they are _rules_, inasmuch as they serve as a rule for out conduct; they are _laws_, inasmuch as they have the sanction of conscience. We respect the _maxims_ of antiquity as containing the essence of human wisdom; we reverence the _precepts_ of religion as the foundation of all happiness; we regard the _rules_ of prudence as preserving us from errors and misfortunes; we respect the _laws_ as they are the support of civil society.

####mean 
**I**  
**MEAN, PITIFUL, SORDID.**  
For the derivation of these words see [low](entry://low), for _mean;_ **pity** under [piteous](entry://piteous) for _pitiful;_ and [bare](entry://bare) for _sordid._ The moral application of these terms to the characters of men, in their transactions with one another, is what constitutes their common signification. Whatever a man does in common with those below him is _mean;_ it evinces a temper that is prone to sink rather than to rise in the scale of society: whatever makes him an object of pity, and consequently of contempt for his degraded character, makes him _pitiful:_ whatever makes him grovel and crawl, intent on low, vile aims, is _sordid_, from the Latin _sordes_, dirty. _Meanness_ is in many cases only relatively bad as it respects the disposal of our property: for instance, what is _meanness_ in one might be generosity or prudence in another: the due estimate of circumstances is allowable in all, but it is _meanness_ for any one to attempt to save, at the expense of others, that which he can conveniently afford either to give or pay: hence an undue spirit of seeking gain or advantage for one's self to the detriment of others is denominated a _mean_ temper: it is _mean_ for a gentleman to do that for himself which according to his circumstances he might get another to do for him. _Pitifulness_ goes farther than _meanness:_ it is not merely that which degrades, but unmans the person; it is that which is weak as well as low: when the fear of evil or the love of gain prompts a man to sacrifice his character and forfeit his veracity he becomes truly _pitiful;_ Blifil in _Tom Jones_ is the character whom all pronounce to be _pitiful. Sordidness_ is peculiarly applicable to one's love of gain; although of a more corrupt, yet it is not of so degrading a nature as the former two: the _sordid_ man does not deal in trifles like the _mean_ man; and has nothing so low and weak in him as the _pitiful_ man. A continual habit of getting money will engender a _sordid_ love of it in the human mind; but nothing short of a degraded character leads a man to be _pitiful._ We dislike a _mean_ man: we hold a _pitiful_ man in profound contempt: we hate a _sordid_ man. _Meanness_ descends to that which is insignificant and worthless: _pitifulness_ sinks into that which is despicable: _sordidness_ contaminates the mind with what is foul.

**II**  
**MEAN, MEDIUM.**  
_Mean_, as here used, is but a contraction of _medium_, which signifies in Latin the middle path. The term _mean_ is used abstractedly in all speculative matters: there is a _mean_ in opinions between the two extremes: this _mean_ is doubtless the point nearest to truth. _Medium_ is employed in practical matters; computations are often erroneous from being too high or too low; the _medium_ is in this case the one most to be preferred. The moralist will always recommend the _mean_ in all opinions that widely differ from each other: our passions always recommend to us some extravagant conduct either of insolent resistance or _mean_ compliance; but discretion recommends the _medium_ or middle course in such matters.

**MEETING, INTERVIEW.**  
_Meeting_, from to _meet_, is the act of _meeting_ or coming into the company of any one: _interview_, compounded of _inter_, between, and _view_, to view, is a personal view of each other. A _meeting_ is an ordinary concern, and its purpose familiar; _meetings_ are daily taking place between friends: an _interview_ is extraordinary and formal; its object is commonly business; an _interview_ sometimes takes place between princes or commanders of armies.

####melody 
**MELODY, HARMONY, ACCORDANCE.**  
_Melody_, from Greek _μελφδία_, from Greek _μέλος_, a song, and _ώδή_, a song, signifies something intended to be sung. _Harmony_, in Latin _harmonia_, Greek _αρμονία_, concord, from _άρμός_, a joining, signifies the agreement of sounds. _Accordance_ denotes the act or state of _according_ (see [agree](entry://agree)).  
_Melody_ signifies any measured or modulated sounds measured after the manner of verse into distinct members or parts; _harmony_ signifies the suiting or adapting different modulated sounds to one another; _melody_ is therefore to _harmony_ as a part to the whole: we must first produce _melody_ by the rules of art; the _harmony_ which follows must be regulated by the ear: there may be _melody_ without _harmony_, but there cannot be _harmony_ without _melody:_ we speak of simple _melody_ where the modes of music are not very much diversified; but we cannot speak of _harmony_ unless there be a variety of notes to fall in with one another. A voice is _melodious_, inasmuch as it is capable of producing a regularly modulated note; it is _harmonious_, inasmuch as it strikes agreeably on the ear and produces no discordant sounds. The song of a bird is _melodious_ or has _melody_ in it, inasmuch as there is a combination of sounds in it which are admitted to be regular, and consequently agreeable to the musical ear; there is _harmony_ in a concert of voices and instruments. _Accordance_ is, strictly speaking, the property on which both _melody_ and _harmony_ are founded; for the whole of music depends on an _accordance_ of sounds. The same distinction marks _accordance_ and _harmony_ in the moral application. There may be occasional _accordance_ of opinion or feeling; but _harmony_ is an entire _accordance_ in every point. 

####member 
**MEMBER, LIMB.**  
_Member_ is the Latin term, from _membrum_, and _limb_ the corresponding native English term from a root signifying a joint.  
_Member_ is a general term applied either to the animal body or to other bodies, as a _member_ of a family, or a _member_ of a community: _limb_ is applicable to animal bodies; _limb_ is therefore a species of _member;_ for every _limb_ is a _member_, but every _member_ is not a _limb._ The _members_ of the body comprehend every part which is capable of performing a distinct office; but the _limbs_ are those jointed _members_ that are distinguished from the head and the body: the nose and the eyes are _members_, but not _limbs;_ the arms and legs are properly denominated _limbs._

####memory 
**MEMORY, REMEMBRANCE, RECOLLECTION, REMINISCENCE.**  
The same root, in Latin _memor_, mindful, _memini_, I remember, etc., is found in three of these words — _memory, remember_, and _reminiscence. Re_, in _remember_ and _reminiscence_, signifies _again_ — to call to mind again being the meaning of the words. _Recollection_, from _re_ and _collect_ (Latin _con_ and _legere_, to bring together), signifies to bring together in the mind again.  
_Memory_ is the power of recalling images once made on the mind; _remembrance, recollection_, and _reminiscence_ are operations or exertions of this power which vary in then mode. The _memory_ is a power which exerts itself either independently of the will or in conformity with the will; but all the other terms express the acts of conscious agents, and consequently are more or less connected with the will. In dreams the _memory_ exerts itself, but we do not say that we have any _remembrance_ or _recollection_ of objects. _Remembrance_ is the exercise of _memory_ in a conscious agent; it may be the effect of repetition or habit, as in the case of a child who _remembers_ his lesson after having learned it several times; or of a horse who _remembers_ the road which he has been continually passing; or it may be the effect of association and circumstances, by which images are casually brought back to the mind, as happens to intelligent beings continually as they exercise then thinking faculties. In these cases _remembrance_ is an involuntary act; for things return to the mind before one is aware of it, as in the case of one who hears a particular name and _remembers_ that he has to call on a person of the same name; or of one who, on seeing a particular tree, _remembers_ all the circumstances of his youth which were connected with a similar tree. _Remembrance_ is, however, likewise a voluntary act, and the consequence of a direct determination, as in the case of a child who strives to _remember_ what it has been told by its parent, or of a friend who _remembers_ the hour of meeting another friend in consequence of the interest which it has excited in his mind: experience teaches us, indeed, that scarcely anything in ordinary cases is more under the subservience of the will than the _memory;_ for it is now become almost a maxim to say that one may _remember_ whatever one wishes.  
The power of _memory_, and the simple exercise of that power in the act of _remembering_, are possessed in common, though in different degrees, by man and animal; but _recollection_ and _reminiscence_ are exercises of the _memory_ that are connected with the higher faculties of man, his judgment and understanding. To _remember_ is to call to mind that which has once been presented to the mind; but to _recollect_ is to _remember_ afresh, to _remember_ what has been _remembered_ before, to recall with an effort what may have been forgotten. _Remembrance_ busies itself with objects that are at hand; _recollection_ carries us back to distant periods: simple _remembrance_ is engaged in things that have but just left the mind, which are more or less easily recalled, and more or less faithfully represented; but _recollection_ tries to retrace the faint images of things that have been so long unthought of as to be almost obliterated from the _memory._ In this manner we are said to _remember_ in one half-hour what was told us in the preceding half-hour, or to _remember_ what passes from one day to another; but we _recollect_ the incidents of childhood; we _recollect_ what happened in our native place after many years' absence from it. _Remembrance_ is that homely, everyday exercise of the _memory_ which renders it of essential service in the acquirement of knowledge or in the performance of one's duties; _recollection_ is that exalted exercise of the _memory_ which affords us the purest of enjoyments and serves the noblest of purposes; the _recollection_ of all the minute incidents of childhood is a more sincere pleasure than any which the present moment can afford.  
_Reminiscence_ is altogether an abstract exercise of the _memory_, which is employed on purely intellectual ideas in distinction from those which are awakened by sensible objects: the mathematician makes use of _reminiscence_ in deducing unknown truths from those which he already knows. _Reminiscence_ among the disciples of Socrates was the _remembrance_ of things purely intellectual, or of that natural knowledge which the souls had had before their union with the body; while the _memory_ was exercised upon sensible things, or that knowledge which was acquired through the medium of the senses. _Reminiscence_, in its familiar application, signifies any event or circumstance long past, which is brought or comes to the mind, and which is usually of a pleasurable nature.  
The Latins said that _reminiscence_ belonged exclusively to man because it was purely intellectual, but that _memory_ was common to all animals because it was merely the terminal point of the senses. That divine, though pagan philosopher, the high-winged Plato, fancied that our souls were at the first infusion _abrasœ tabulœ_, and that all our future knowledge was but a _reminiscence._

####mental 
**MENTAL, INTELLECTUAL, INTELLIGENT.**  
There is the same difference between _mental_ and _intellectual_ as between _mind_ and _intellect:_ the _mind_ comprehends the thinking faculty in general, with all its operations; the _intellect_ includes only that part of it which consists of understanding and judgment: _mental_ is therefore opposed to corporeal; _intellectual_ is opposed to sensual or physical: _mental_ exertions are not to be expected from all; _intellectual_ enjoyments fall to the lot of comparatively few. Objects, pleasures, pains, operations, gifts, etc., are denominated _mental;_ subjects, conversation, pursuits, and the like are entitled _intellectual._ It is not always easy to distinguish our _mental_ pleasures from those corporeal pleasures which we enjoy in common with animals; the latter are, however, greatly heightened by the former in whatever degree they are blended: in a society of well-informed persons, the conversation will turn principally on _intellectual_ subjects.  
_Intelligent_, from _intelligens_, understanding or knowing, is a characteristic of the person: an _intelligent_ being or an intelligence denotes a being purely spiritual or abstracted from matter.  
When applied to individuals, it denotes having a quick understanding of things, as an _intelligent_ child. 

####mention 
**MENTION, NOTICE.**  
_Mention_, from _mens_, mind, signifies here to bring to mind. _Notice_ (see [mark](entry://mark)). These terms are synonymous only inasmuch as they imply the act of calling things to another person's mind. We _mention_ a thing in direct terms: we _notice_ it indirectly or in a casual manner; we _mention_ that which may serve as information; we _notice_ that which may be merely of a personal or incidental nature. One friend _mentions_ to another what has passed at a particular meeting: in the course of conversation he _notices_ or calls to the _notice_ of his companion the badness of the road, the wideness of the street, or the like. 

####mercantile 
**MERCANTILE, COMMERCIAL.**  
Both _mercantile_ and _commercial_ come from Latin _merx_, pay, salable goods. _Mercantile_, from the same source, signifies the actual transaction of business, or a transfer of merchandise by sale or purchase; _commercial_ comprehends the theory and practice of _commerce:_ hence we speak in a peculiar manner of a _mercantile_ house, a _mercantile_ town, a _mercantile_ situation, and the like; but of a _commercial_ education, a _commercial_ people, _commercial_ speculations, and the like.

####merge 
**MERGE, COMBINE, INCLUDE, UNITE.**  
These words all signify the union of two or more things, but they differ in the closeness of the union and the character of the image under which it is suggested. _Merge_, from Latin _mergere_, to sink into water, to dip, signifies the closest union — the absolute swallowing up of one thing by another. _Include_ suggests a similar idea — from Latin _in_, in, and _claudere_, to close — signifying to enclose. _Merge_, however, suggests more clearly the loss of identity of the thing _merged_ or swallowed up, and is a stronger word. _Unite._ from Latin _unire_, based on _unus_, one, signifies to make one; it differs in the relation implied between the two or more objects. The lesser can only be _included_ or _merged_ in the greater. Two equal things may be _united. Combine_ (see **association** under [associate](entry://associate) and CONNECT) signifies a relation that is not so close as that indicated in _unite_ — as is explained in the article on CONNECT.

####message 
**MESSAGE, ERRAND.**  
_Message_, from the Latin _missus_, participle of _mittere_, to send, and a suffix, signifies the thing sent. _Errand_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _œrende_, a message.  
The _message_ is properly any communication which is conveyed; the _errand_ on which one person sends another is that which causes one to go: servants are the bearers of _messages_, and are sent on various _errands._ A _message_ may be either verbal or written; an _errand_ is limited to no form and to no circumstance: one delivers the _message_, and goes the _errand._ Sometimes the _message_ may be the _errand_, and the _errand_ may include the _message:_ when that which is sent consists of a notice or intimation to another, it is a _message;_ and if that causes any one to go to a place, it is an _errand:_ thus it is that the greater part of _errands_ consists of sending _messages_ from one person to another.

It refers to formal and governmental preparation for war. _Militancy_, and its adjective _militant_, signify merely the general disposition to fight for a cause, and may have nothing to do with the actual science of warfare. A _militant_ individual is one who is ready to fight, either physically or with the pen or the tongue, for his cause; a _military_ man is a man who is or has been a part of a regularly constituted army.

####mindful 
**MINDFUL, REGARDFUL, OBSERVANT.**  
_Mindful_ signifies that which we wish from others; _regardful_ that which in itself demands _regard_ or serious thought, particularly what _regards_ the interests and feelings of others; _observant_ implies both that which is communicated by others and that which carries its own obligations with itself: a child should always be _mindful_ of its parents' instructions; they should never be forgotten: every one should be _regardful_ of his several duties and obligations; they ought never to be neglected: one ought to be _observant_ of the religious duties which one's profession enjoins upon him; they cannot with propriety be passed over. By being _mindful_ of what one hears from the wise and good, one learns to be wise and good; by being _regardful_ of what is due to one's self and to society at large, one learns to pass through the world with satisfaction to one's own mind and esteem from others; by being _observant_ of all rule and order, we afford to others a salutary example for their imitation.

####minister 
**MINISTER, AGENT.**  
_Minister_ comes from _minus_, less, as _magister_ comes from _magis_, more, the one being less, and the other more, than others: the _minister_, therefore, is literally one who acts in a subordinate capacity; and the _agent_ (from _ago_, to act) is the one who takes the acting part: they both perform the will of another, but the _minister_ performs a higher part than the _agent:_ the _minister_ gives his counsel and exerts his intellectual powers in the service of another, but the _agent_ executes the orders or commissions given him: a _minister_ is employed by government in political affairs; an _agent_ is employed by individuals in commercial and pecuniary affairs, or by government in subordinate matters: a _minister_ is received at court and serves as a representative for his government; an _agent_ generally acts under the directions of the _minister_ or some office of government: ambassadors or plenipotentiaries or the first officers of the state are _ministers;_ but those who regulate the affairs respecting prisoners, the police, and the like are termed _agents._ A _minister_ always holds a public character and is in the service of the state; the _agent_ may be acting only for another individual, as a commercial _agent._  
See also [clergyman](entry://clergyman)  
**MINISTER, ADMINISTER, CONTRIBUTE.** — To _minister_, from the noun _minister_, in the sense of a servant, signifies to act in subservience to another, and may be taken either in a good, bad, or indifferent sense, as to _minister_ to the spiritual wants or to _minister_ to another's caprices and indulgences when we encourage them unnecessarily. _Administer_, that is, to _minister_ for a specific purpose, is taken in the good sense of serving another to his advantage: thus the Good Samaritan _administered_ to the comfort of the man who had fallen among thieves. _Contribute_ (see [conduce](entry://conduce)) is taken in either a good or bad sense; we may _contribute_ to the relief of the indigent or we may _contribute_ to the follies and vices of others. Princes are sometimes placed in the unfortunate situation that those who should direct them in early life only _minister_ to their vices by every means in their power: it is the part of the Christian to _administer_ comfort to those who are in want, consolation to the afflicted, advice to those who are feeble, and support to those who cannot uphold themselves: it is the part of all who are in high stations to _contribute_ to the dissemination of religion and morality among their dependents; but there are, on the contrary, many who _contribute_ to the spread of immorality and a contempt of all sacred things by the most pernicious example of irreligion in themselves.

These terms all express that species of gayety or joy which belongs to company, or to men in their social intercourse. _Mirth_ refers to the feeling displayed in the outward conduct: _merriment_ and the other terms refer rather to the external expressions of the feeling, or the causes of the feeling, than to the feeling itself: _mirth_ shows itself in laughter, in dancing, singing, and noise; _merriment_ consists of such things as are apt to excite _mirth:_ the more we are disposed to laugh the greater is our _mirth;_ the more there is to create laughter the greater is the _merriment:_ the tricks of Punch and his wife and the jokes of a clown cause much _mirth_ among the gaping crowd of rustics; the amusements with the swing or the merry-go-round afford much _merriment_ to the visitants of a fair. _Mirth_ is confined to no age or station; but _merriment_ belongs more particularly to young people or those of the lower station; _mirth_ may be provoked wherever any number of persons is assembled; _merriment_ cannot go forward anywhere so properly as at fairs or public places. _Joviality_ or _jollity_, and _hilarity_, are species of _merriment_ which belong to the convivial board: _joviality_ or _jollity_ may accompany the pleasures of the table or any social entertainments; _hilarity_ is the same thing qualified by the cultivation and good sense of the company; we may expect to find much _joviality_ and _jollity_ at a public dinner of plain people; we may expect to find _hilarity_ at a public dinner of gentlemen: eating, drinking, and noise constitute the _joviality;_ the conversation, the songs, the toasts, and the public spirit of the company contribute to _hilarity._

####misanthropical 
**MISANTHROPICAL, CYNICAL.**  
_Misanthropical_ and _cynical_ both indicate a hostile attitude to mankind in general. _Misanthropical_, from Greek μισ͡_ειν_, to hate, and _άνθρωπος_, man, means hating mankind. _Cynical_ comes from Greek _κυνικός_, which originally meant doglike, currish, snappish, and was the designation of a sect of Greek philosophers who affected to disbelieve in human goodness. _Misanthropical_ implies a morbid psychological condition — often a nervous horror or fear of others, which has some definite external cause. _Cynical_ indicates an intellectual attitude — a disbelief in the goodness of others, and a consequent tendency to sneer. The _misanthrope_ makes himself miserable; the _cynic_ makes others miserable.  
The _misanthropical_ man separates himself from the rest of human society; the _cynical_ man moves among men sneering. _Cynicism_ is often a characteristic of men of the world who have seen much of the shams and selfishness of society. The _misanthropical_ man is often one who has suffered from some great shock to his belief in human nature.

####misconstrue 
**MISCONSTRUE, MISINTERPRET.**  
_Misconstrue_ and _misinterpret_ signify to explain in a wrong way; but the former connotes the sense of one's words or the application of one's actions: those who indulge themselves in a light mode of speech toward children are liable to be _misconstrued;_ a too great tenderness to the criminal may be easily _misinterpreted_ in favor of the crime. These words may likewise be employed in speaking of language in general; but the former implies the literal transmission of foreign ideas into our native language; the latter the general sense which one affixes to any set of words, either in a native or foreign language: the learners of a language will unavoidably _misconstrue_ it at times; in all languages there are ambiguous expressions which are liable to _misinterpretations. Misconstruing_ is the consequence of ignorance; _misinterpretations_ of particular words are oftener the consequence of prejudice and voluntary blindness, particularly in the explanation of the law or of the Scriptures.

####mix 
**MIX, MINGLE, BLEND, CONFOUND.**  
_Mix_ is in Anglo-Saxon _miscian_, from Latin _miscere_, to intermingle. _Mingle_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _mengan_, to mix, allied to _among. Blend_ is a Scandinavian word meaning to mix together.  
_Mix_ is here a general and indefinite term, signifying simply to put together: but we may _mix_ two or several tilings; we _mingle_ several objects: things are _mixed_ so as to lose all distinction, but they may be _mingled_ and yet retain a distinction: liquids _mix_ so as to become one, and individuals _mix_ in a crowd so as to be lost; things of different sizes are _mingled_ together if they Me in the same spot, but they still may be distinguished. To _blend_ is only partially to _mix_, as colors _blend_ which fall into each other: to _confound_ is to _mix_ in a wrong way, as objects of sight are _confounded_ when they are erroneously taken to be joined. To _mix_ and _mingle_ are mostly applied to material objects, except in poetry; to _blend_ and _confound_ are mental operations, and principally employed on spiritual subjects: thus, events and circumstances are _blended_ together in a narrative; the ideas of the ignorant are _confounded_ in most cases, but particularly when they attempt to think for themselves.  
**MIXTURE, MEDLEY, MISCELLANY.** — _Mixture_ is the thing _mixed. Medley_ comes from Old French _medler_, to mix or confuse. _Miscellany_, in Latin _miscellaneus_, from _miscere_, to _mix_, signifies also a _mixture._  
The term _mixture_ is general; whatever objects can be _mixed_ will form a _mixture:_ a _medley_ is a _mixture_ of things not fit to be _mixed;_ and a _miscellany_ is a _mixture_ of many different things. Flour, water, and eggs may form a _mixture_ in the proper sense, but if to these were added all sorts of spices it would form a _medley. Miscellany_ is a species applicable only to intellectual subjects: the _miscellaneous_ is opposed to that which is systematically arranged; essays are _miscellaneous_ in distinction from works on one particular subject.

####moderation 
**MODERATION, MEDIOCRITY.**  
_Moderation_ (see **modesty** under [modest](entry://modest)) is the characteristic of persons; _mediocrity_ (that is, the mean or medium) characterizes their condition: _moderation_ is a virtue of no small importance for beings who find excess in everything to be an evil; _mediocrity_ in external circumstances is exempt from all the evils which attend either poverty or riches. 

####modern 
See [new](entry://new)

####modest 
**MODEST, BASHFUL, DIFFIDENT.**  
_Modest_, in Latin _modestus_, from _modus_, a measure, signifies setting measure to one's estimate of one's self. _Bashful_ signifies ready to be _abashed_ (see [abash](entry://abash)). _Diffident_ (see **distrustful** under [distrust](entry://distrust)).  
_Modesty_ is a habit or principle of the mind; _bashfulness_ is a state of feeling: _modesty_ is at all times becoming; _bashfulness_ is observed only in young girls or other young persons in the presence of their superiors: _modesty_ discovers itself in the absence of everything assuming, whether in look, word, or action; _bash-fulness_ betrays itself by a downcast look and a timid air: a _modest_ deportment is always commendable; a _bashful_ temper is not desirable.  
_Modesty_ is a proper distrust of ourselves; _diffidence_ is a culpable distrust. _Modesty_, though opposed to assurance, is not incompatible with a confidence in ourselves; _diffidence_ altogether unmans a person and disqualifies him for his duty: a person is generally _modest_ in the display of his talents to others; but a _diffident_ man cannot turn his talents to his own use.  
See also [humble](entry://humble)  
**MODESTY, MODERATION, TEMPERANCE, SOBRIETY.** — _Modesty_, in French _modestie_, Latin _modestia_, and _moderation_, in Latin _moderatio_, both come from _modus_, a measure, limit, or boundary, that is, forming a measure or rule. _Temperance_, in Latin _temperantia_, from _tempus_, time, signifies the observance of proper times and seasons — propriety, self-control. _Sobriety_ (see **abstinent** under [abstain](entry://abstain)).  
_Modesty_ lies in the mind and in the quality of feeling; _moderation_ in the desires: _modesty_ is a principle that acts discretionally; _moderation_ is a rule or line that acts as a restraint on the views and the outward conduct: he who thinks _modestly_ of his own acquirements, his own performances, and his own merits will be _moderate_ in his expectations of praise, reward, and recompense; he, on the other hand, who overrates his own abilities and qualifications will equally overrate the use he makes of them, and consequently be _immoderate_ in the price which he sets upon his services: in such cases, therefore, _modesty_ and _moderation_ are to each other as cause and effect; but there may be _modesty_ without _moderation_, and _moderation_ without _modesty. Modesty_ is a sentiment confined to one's self as the object, and consisting solely of one's judgment of what one is and what one does; but _moderation_, as is evident from the above, extends to objects that are external of ourselves _modesty_, rather than _moderation_, belongs to an author; _moderation_, rather than _modesty_, belongs to a tradesman or a man who has gains to make and purposes to answer.  
_Modesty_ shields a man from mortifications and disappointments, which assail the self-conceited man in every direction: a _modest_ man conciliates the esteem even of an enemy and a rival. _Moderation_ protects a man equally from injustice, on the one hand, and imposition, on the other: he who is _moderate_ himself makes others so.  
_Moderation_ is the measure of one's desires, one's habits, one's actions, and one's words; _temperance_ is the adaptation of the time or season for particular feelings, actions, or words: a man is said to be _moderate_ in his principles who adopts the medium or middle course of thinking; it rather qualifies the thing than the person: he is said to be _temperate_ in his anger, if he does not suffer it to break out into any excesses; _temperance_ characterizes the person rather than the thing. A _moderate_ man in politics endeavors to steer clear of all party spirit, and is consequently so _temperate_ in his language as to provoke no animosity. _Moderation_ in the enjoyment of everything is essential in order to obtain the purest pleasure: _temperance_ in one's indulgences is always attended with the happiest effects to the constitution; as, on the contrary, any deviation from _temperance_, even in a single instance, is always punished with bodily pain and sickness.  
_Temperance_ and _sobriety_ have already been considered in their proper application (see **abstinent** under [abstain](entry://abstain)), which will serve to illustrate their improper application. _Temperance_ is an action; it is the _tempering_ of our words and actions to the circumstances: _sobriety_ is a state in which one is exempt from every stimulus to deviate from the right course; as a man who is intoxicated with wine runs into excesses and loses that power of guiding himself which he has when he is _sober_ or free from all intoxication, so is he who is affected by any passion, in like manner, hurried away into irregularities which, a man in his right senses will not be guilty of: _sobriety_ is, therefore, the state of being in one's right or sober senses; and _sobriety_ is, with regard to _temperance_, as a cause to the effect: _sobriety_ of mind will not only produce _moderation_ and _temperance_, but extend its influence to the whole conduct of a man in every relation and circumstance, to his internal sentiments and his external behavior: hence we speak of _sobriety_ in one's mien or deportment, _sobriety_ in one's dress and manners, _sobriety_ in one's religious opinions and observances. _Sober_ may also be applied figuratively. 

####moisture 
**MOISTURE, HUMIDITY, DAMPNESS.**  
_Moisture_ is a word of disputed origin. _Humid_ comes from Latin _humidus_, from the verb _humera_, to be moist. _Dampness_ comes from the same root as the German _dampf_, a vapor.  
_Moisture_ is used in general to express any small degree of infusion of a liquid into a body; _humidity_ is employed scientifically to describe the state of having any portion of such liquid: hence we speak of the _moisture_ of a table, the _moisture_ of paper, or the _moisture_ of a floor that has been wet; but of the _humidity_ of the air or of a wall that has contracted _moisture_ of itself. _Dampness_ is that species of _moisture_ that arises from the gradual contraction of a liquid in bodies capable of retaining it; in this manner a cellar is _damp_, or linen that has lain long may become _damp._

####molest 
See [inconvenience](entry://inconvenience); [trouble](entry://trouble)

####mollify 
**MOLLIFY, APPEASE, PACIFY, SOOTHE.**  
These words all mean to change from a state of wrath or disturbed emotion to one of peace. _Mollify_ comes from Latin _mollis_, soft, tender, and a weak form of _facere_, to make. It signifies to make soft or mild. _Appease_ comes from Old French _a pais_, Latin _ad pacem_, at peace, or rather to a state of peace. _Mollify, pacify_ (from Latin _pax_, peace, and a weak form of _facere_, to make), and _appease_ differ from each other in the degree of emotion suggested and the extent of the peace produced. To _mollify_ is not so strong a word as to _pacify_, and to _pacify_ does not suggest such dangerous wrath as _appease. Appease_ is used especially with reference to persons or powers greater than ourselves. Men offered sacrifices in olden times to _appease_ the gods; in the old fairy-tales beautiful maidens were offered as victims to _appease_ the voracity of dragons and sea-monsters, etc. _Pacify_ suggests a less dangerous anger or emotion. We _appease_ the wrath that is dangerous to us; we _pacify_ that which is merely annoying or vexatious — as when we _pacify_ a crying child. _Mollify_ and _soothe_ are more general expressions. To _mollify_ is to make gentle that which was violent. To _soothe_, from Anglo-Saxon _sooth_, truth, meant to "say sooth" — to agree with or say "yes" to. _Soothe_ is more suggestive of physical action than _mollify._ We may _soothe_ a wound by the application of healing salves, for instance, as well as _soothe_ a ruffled temper with gentle words. _Mollify_ has only the moral application. _Mollify_ implies emotional excitement hostile to others which should be allayed; _soothe_ merely implies any kind of disturbance. We _mollify_ others for our own sakes; we _soothe_ them for their own.

####money 
**MONEY, CASH.**  
_Money_ comes from the Latin _moneta_, a surname of Juno, in whose temple at Rome money was coined. _Cash_, from the French casse, a chest, signifies that which is put in a chest.  
_Money_ is applied to everything which serves as a circulating medium; _cash_ is, in a strict sense, put for coin only: bank-notes are _money;_ guineas and shillings are _cash;_ all _cash_ is therefore _money_, but all _money_ is not _cash._ The only _money_ the Chinese have are square bits of metal with a hole through the center by which they are strung upon a string: travellers on the Continent must always be provided with letters of credit, which may be turned into _cash_, as convenience requires. 

####monoplane 
See [aircraft](entry://aircraft)

####monopolize 
**MONOPOLIZE, ABSORB, APPROPRIATE, ENGROSS.**  
These words all mean to take complete or exclusive possession of something. _Appropriate_ is the least emphatic. It comes from Latin _ad_, to, and _proprius_, one's own, and means to make completely one's own. Absorb (for derivation see [absorb](entry://absorb)) goes further. It means not only to make one's own, but to swallow up entirely, so that the identity of the thing _absorbed_ is lost. _Engross_ and _monopolize_ have similar meanings expressed under commercial figures. _Engross_ is from the French _en gros_, in the _gross_, and means to buy up by the wholesale. _Monopolize_ has a similar meaning. It comes from Greek _μόνος_ and πωλ͡_ειν_, to sell, and means to obtain the exclusive right of selling. In ordinary usage there is little difference between _monopolize_ and _engross. Monopolize_ perhaps carries more of the suggestion of exclusiveness; _engross_ more of absorption.

####monument 
**MONUMENT, MEMORIAL.**  
_Monument_, in Latin _monumentum_ or _monimentum_, from _moneo_, to advise or remind, and a suffix, signifies that which puts us in mind of something. _Memorial_, from _memory_, signifies the thing that helps the memory.  
From the above it is clear that these terms have, in their original derivation, precisely the same signification, but differ in their collateral acceptations: _monument_ is applied to that which is purposely set up to keep a thing in mind; _memorials_ are any objects which are calculated to call a thing to mind: a _monument_ is used to preserve a public object of notice from being forgotten; a _memorial_ serves to keep an individual in mind: the _monument_ is commonly understood to be a species of building, as a tomb which preserves the _memory_ of the dead, or a pillar which preserves the _memory_ of some public event: the _memorial_ always consists of something which was the property, or in the possession, of another, as his picture, his handwriting, his hair, and the like. The _Monument_ at London was built to commemorate the dreadful fire of the city in the year 1666: friends who are at a distance are happy to have some token of each other's regard, which they likewise keep as a _memorial_ of their former intercourse.  
The _monument_, in its proper sense, is always made of wood or stone for some specific purpose; but in the improper sense anything may be termed a _monument_ when it serves the purpose of reminding the public of any circumstance: thus, the pyramids are _monuments_ of antiquity; the actions of a good prince are more lasting _monuments_ than either brass or marble. _Memorials_ are mostly of a private nature, and at the same time such as remind us naturally of the object to which they have belonged; this object is generally some person.  
But it may likewise refer to some thing, if it be of a personal nature, or that by which persons are individually affected: our Saviour instituted the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper as a _memorial_ of His death.

####motion 
**MOTION, MOVEMENT**.  
These are both abstract terms to denote the act of _moving_, but _motion_ is taken generally and abstractedly from the thing that _moves; movement_, on the other hand, is taken in connection with the agent or thing that _moves:_ hence we speak of a state of _motion_ as opposed to a state of rest, of perpetual _motion_, the laws of _motion_, and the like; on the other hand, we say, to make a _movement_, when speaking of an army, a general _movement_ when speaking of an assembly.  
When _motion_ is qualified by the thing that _moves_ it denotes continued _motion;_ but _movement_ implies only a particular _motion:_ hence we say, the _motion_ of the heavenly bodies; the _motion_ of the earth; a person is in continual _motion_, or an army is in _motion;_ but a person who rises or sits down or goes from one chair to another makes a _movement;_ the different _movements_ of the springs and wheels of any instrument.

####mournful 
**MOURNFUL, SAD.**  
_Mournful_ (from Anglo-Saxon _meornan_, to grieve, Modern English _mourn)_ signifies full of what causes _mourning; sad_ (see [dull](entry://dull)) signifies either a painful sentiment or what causes this painful sentiment. The difference in the sentiment is what constitutes the difference between these epithets: the _mournful_ awakens tender and sympathetic feelings: the _sad_ oppresses the spirits and makes one heavy at heart; a _mournful_ tale contains an account of others' distress; a _sad_ story contains an account of one's own distress; a _mournful_ event befalls our friends and relatives; a _sad_ misfortune befalls ourselves. Selfish people find nothing _mournful_, but many things sad: tender-hearted people are always affected by what is _mournful_, and are less troubled about what is _sad._

####moving 
**MOVING, AFFECTING, PATHETIC.**  
The _moving_ is in general whatever moves the affections or the passions; the _affecting_ and _pathetic_ are what move the _affections_ in different degrees. The good or bad feelings may be _moved;_ the tender feelings only are _affected._ A field of battle is a _moving_ spectacle: the death of a friend is an _affecting_ spectacle. The _affecting_ acts by means of the scenes as well as the understanding; the _pathetic_ applies only to what is addressed to the heart: hence, a sight or a description is _affecting;_ but an address is _pathetic._

####moving picture 
**MOVING PICTURE, MOTION PICTURE, CINEMATOGRAPH, PHOTOPLAY, MOVIE.**  
As is the case with most, names of recent inventions, these terms differ not in meaning, but in application and usage. They all indicate the invention whereby figures in motion are photographed, so that the movement is reproduced when the picture is thrown on a screen. _Moving picture_ was the name first used for this invention, but _motion picture_ has also come into general usage and has beer, adopted by many of the corporations producing these pictures. _Moving picture_ seems to a purist a more desirable term, because _moving_ is an adjective form, whereas in the case of _motion picture_ a substantive is made to do duty as an adjective. But some people contend that _motion picture_ is a more accurate word, since the pictures themselves do not move; they are merely photographs of _motion._ The two terms, however, are used interchangeably. _Movie_ is a popular abbreviation of _moving picture_, and one which, perhaps, deserves to receive general recognition as a new word, inasmuch as it is a spontaneous popular coinage to indicate a new invention, rather than a scientific name laboriously patched together out of Greek and Latin. _Cinematograph_ is the technical term corresponding to _moving picture_, from Greek _κίνειν_, to move, and _γράφειν_, to mark or write. This is frequently shortened to _cinema_, which is also becoming a popular term for the _moving picture_, and is used among educated people sometimes as a more elegant substitute for _movie. Photoplay_ differs somewhat from the other terms in its application. It is applied to a particular _moving-picture_ drama, a play in pictures. The other words are rather indiscriminately used to indicate individual _moving-picture_ plays, _moving-picture_ houses, or the representations of the _moving picture._

####mulct

####multiplane

####multitude 
**MULTITUDE, CROWD, THRONG, SWARM.**  
The idea of many is common to all these terms, and peculiar to that of _multitude_, from the Latin _multus; crowd_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _crudan_, to push; and _throng_ from Anglo-Saxon _thringan_, to press; and _swarm_, like the German _schwärmen_, to fly about, signifies running together in numbers. These terms vary, either in regard to the object or the circumstance: _multitude_ is applicable to any object; _crowd, throng_, and _swarm_ are in the proper sense applicable only to animate objects: the first two in regard to persons; the last to animals. A _multitude_ may be either in a stagnant or a moving state; all the rest denote a _multitude_ in a moving state: a _crowd_ is always pressing, generally eager and tumultuous; a _throng_ may be busy and active, but not always pressing or incommodious: it is always inconvenient, sometimes dangerous, to go into a _crowd;_ it is amusing to see the _throng_ that is perpetually passing in the streets of the city: the _swarm_ is more active than either of the two others; it is commonly applied to bees which fly together in numbers, but sometimes to human beings, to denote their very great numbers when scattered about; thus the children of the poor in low neighborhoods _swarm_ in the streets.

####mutilate 
**MUTILATE, MAIM, MANGLE.**  
_Mutilate_, in Latin _mutilatus_, from _mutilus_, Greek _μύτιλος_, curtailed, docked, signifies to take off any necessary part. _Maim_, in Anglo-French _mahaym_, is a word of unknown origin. _Mangle_, in Anglo-French _mahangler_, is a frequentative of it.  
_Mutilate_ has the most extended meaning; it implies the total or partial loss of any limb: _mangle_ is applied to irregular wounds in any part of the body: _maim_ is confined to wounds in the limbs, particularly the hands. Men are exposed to the danger of _mutilation_ by means of cannon-balls; they run the risk of being _mangled_ when attacked with the sword; they frequently get _maimed_ when boarding vessels or storming places.  
_Mutilate_ and _mangle_ are applicable to moral objects; _maim_ is employed in the natural or figurative sense. In this case _mangle_ is a much stronger term than _mutilate;_ the latter signifies to lop off an essential part; to _mangle_ is to _mutilate_ a thing to such degree as to render it useless or worthless. Every sect of Christians is fond of _mutilating_ the Bible by setting aside such parts as do not favor its own scheme; and among them all the sacred Scriptures become literally _mangled_ and stripped of all their most important doctrines. 

####mutinous 
See [tumultuous](entry://tumultuous)

####mutual 
**MUTUAL, RECIPROCAL.**  
_Mutual_, in Latin _mutuus_, from _muto_, to change, signifies exchanged so as to be equal, or the same, on both sides. _Reciprocal_, in Latin _reciprocus_, meant, literally, back and forth, from _reco_, back, and _proco_, forward. _Mutual_ supposes a sameness in condition at the same time: _reciprocal_ supposes an alternation or succession of returns. Exchange is free and voluntary; we give in exchange, and this action is _mutual:_ return is made either according to law or equity: it is obligatory, and when equally obligatory on each in turn it is _reciprocal._ Voluntary disinterested services rendered by one person to another are _mutual:_ imposed or merited services, returned from one to the other, are _reciprocal:_ friends render one another _mutual_ services; the services between servants and masters are _reciprocal._ The husband and wife pledge their faith to each other _mutually;_ they are _reciprocally_ bound to keep their vow of fidelity. The sentiment is _mutual_, the tie is _reciprocal. Mutual_ applies mostly to matters of will and opinion: a _mutual_ affection, a _mutual_ inclination to oblige, a _mutual_ interest for each other's comfort, a _mutual_ concern to avoid that which will displease the other — these are the sentiments which render the marriage state happy: _reciprocal_ ties, _reciprocal_ bonds, _reciprocal_ rights, _reciprocal_ duties — these are what every one ought to bear in mind as a member of society, that he may expect of no man more than what in equity he is disposed to return.  
_Mutual_ applies to nothing but what is personal; _reciprocal_ is applied to things remote from the idea of personality, as _reciprocal_ verbs, _reciprocal_ terms, _reciprocal_ relations, and the like. 

####mysterious 
**MYSTERIOUS, MYSTIC.**  
_Mysterious_ and _mystic_ are but variations of the same original, Greek _μύστης_, one who is initiated into a secret religious order: the former, however, is more commonly applied to that which is supernatural or veiled in an impenetrable obscurity: the latter to that which is natural, but concealed by an artificial or fantastical veil; hence we speak of the _mysterious_ plans of Providence: _mystic_ schemes of theology or _mystic_ principles.

####nab 
**NAB, APPROPRIATE, CLUTCH, GRASP, SEIZE.**  
_Nab_ is a Scandinavian word signifying to snatch at. Although the term has a wide range of usage and has long been recognized in polite language, in itself it is very near slang. A person by cunning, deceit, sharp practice may _nab_ or _appropriate_ from another credit for an achievement, some property, or other possession-conquering nations _appropriate, seize_, take possession of territory belonging to a defeated opponent as a spoil of war, and this has heretofore been considered right and proper.  
To _appropriate_ may be a slow action, one resulting from a more or less prolonged parley or negotiation, but to _seize_ implies the real meaning of to _nab._ To _clutch_ also implies a swift action, as a drowning person will _clutch_ at anything likely to save his life, a falling person will _clutch, seize_, lay hold of any near-by object that will save a complete fall. To _grasp_ implies actions both good and indefensible. It is a delight to _grasp_ the hand of a friend; it is a great accomplishment to possess the intellectual capacity to _grasp_ the spirit, truth, intent of a subject readily; but it is not justifiable to _grasp_, lay hold of greedily, take sudden possession of that which belongs to another without warrant or justification. 

####nacreous 
**NACREOUS, IRIDESCENT, OPALESCENT, PEARLY, POLYCHROMATIC.**  
These words all signify characterized by an interplay of colors, and derive their names and their respective differences from various substances. _Nacreous_, from _nacre_, mother-of-pearl (probably an Oriental word), takes its name from the inner covering of an oyster-shell and of certain other shells. It indicates a shining substance of the silvery gray color of the pearl, but shimmering with _iridescent_ colors that appear and vanish as the light strikes it. _Iridescent_, from Latin _iris_, Greek _ϊρις_, the rainbow, signifies, literally, having all the colors of the rainbow. Polychromatic, from Greek _πολύ_, much, and _χρώμα_, color, has a similar literal meaning less metaphorically expressed. But _iridescent_ suggests both changefulness and light as well as color — an interplay of colors like light. _Polychromatic_ is a more prosaic word; it merely means having many colors. _Opalescent_ (from Latin _opalus_, English _opal_, the name of a precious stone) means resembling an _opal_ — that is, having an interplay of soft milky-hued colors shot with flashes and gleams of fiery light. _Pearly_, from _pearl_ (French _perle_, a word of unknown origin), means resembling the lustrous silvery white or silvery gray of the pearl which is sometimes touched with the faintest glow of color 

####naive 
**NAIVE, INGENUOUS, ARTLESS.**  
These words all refer to an absence of pretence and sophistication, and are used, in a good sense, to describe naturalness and simplicity. Of these three words _naïve_ is the most inclusive and the most difficult to define. It is an imperfectly naturalized French word (from Latin _nativus_, native, inborn) which is almost always used in English with a feeling that it expresses something that cannot be described in blunt English terms.  
_Ingenuous_ (from Latin root _gen_, indicating birth) meant originally the simplicity and frankness of a well-born youth, and indicates a quality of character.  
_Artless_ means without _art_, and indicates primarily a mental characteristic. We say that a child is _artless_, that a young girl is _artless_, but that a youth is _ingenuous. Artless_ conveys the impression of a certain innocence and ignorance of the world; _ingenuous_, the impression of an inborn disposition. _Naive_ expresses the idea involved in _artless_ with a certain subtlety. It really differs from artless mainly in indicating a difference in the _perceiver_, rather than the Quality _perceived._ It is faintly suggestive of that slight shade of tender-hearted amusement — of that complete sympathy of the heart, combined with a certain intellectual superiority and detachment — with which the educated or experienced man views an expression of _artlessness._ There are only a few words in English whose effectiveness depends so entirely upon an atmosphere undefinable and untranslatable; the other words of this character are also French.

####name 
**NAME, CALL.**  
_Name_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _noma_, a name, allied to Latin _nomen_, a name. _Call_ is a Scandinavian word. To _call_ signifies properly to address one loudly, consequently we may _name_ without _calling_, when we only mention a _name_ in conversation; and we may _call_ without _naming._  
The terms may, however, be employed in the sense of assigning a _name._ In this case a person is _named_ by his _name_, whether by the proper patronymic or by some habitual variant; he is _called_ according to the characteristics by which he is distinguished. The Emperor Tiberius was _named_ Tiberius; he was _called_ a monster. William the First of England is _named_ William; he is _called_ the Conqueror.  
**NAME, APPELLATION, TITLE, DENOMINATION.** — _Name_ (see above). _Appellation_, in French _appellation_, Latin _appellatio_, comes from Latin _ad_, to, and a stem meaning to speak, allied to Anglo-Saxon and Modern English _spell. Title_, in French _titre_, comes from Latin _titulus_, a superscription on a tomb. _Denomination_ signifies that which _denominates_ or distinguishes.  
_Name_ is a generic term, the rest are specific. Whatever word is employed to distinguish one thing from another is a _name;_ therefore, an _appellation_ and a _title_ are a _name_, but not _vice versa._ A _name_ is either common or proper; an _appellation_ is generally a common _name_ given for some specific purpose as characteristic. Several kings of France had the _names_ of Charles, Louis, Philip; but one was distinguished by the _appellation_ of Stammerer, another by that of the Simple, and a third by that of the Hardy, arising from particular characters or circumstances. A _title_ is a species of _appellation_, not drawn from anything personal, but conferred as a ground of political distinction, An _appellation_ may be often a term of reproach; but a _title is_ always a mark of honor. An _appellation_ is given to all objects, animate or inanimate; a _title_ is given mostly to persons, sometimes to things. A particular house may have the _appellation_ of "the Cottage, " or "the Hall, " as a particular person may have the _title_ of Duke, Lord, or Marquis.  
_Denomination_ is to particular bodies what _appellation_ is to an individual, namely, a term of distinction, drawn from their peculiar characters and circumstances. The Christian world is split into a number of different bodies or communities, under the _denominations_ of Catholics, Protestants, Calviniste, Presbyterians, etc., which have their origin in the peculiar form of faith and discipline adopted by these bodies.  
**NAME, DENOMINATE, STYLE, ENTITLE, DESIGNATE, CHARACTERIZE.** — To _name_ signifies simply to give a _name_ to, or to address or specify by the given _name;_ to _denominate_ (from Latin _nomen_, name) is to give a specific _name_ upon specific ground, to distinguish by the _name;_ to _style_, from the noun _style_ or manner (see [diction](entry://diction)), signifies to address by a specific _name;_ to _entitle_ is to give the specific or appropriate title. Adam _named_ everything; we _denominate_ the man who drinks excessively "a drunkard"; subjects _style_ their monarch "His Majesty"; books are _entitled_ according to the judgment of the author.  
To _name, denominate, style_, and _entitle_ are the acts of conscious agents only. To _designate_, signifying to mark out, and _characterize_, signifying to form a _characteristic_, are usually said only of things, and agree with the former only inasmuch as words may either _designate_ or _characterize:_ thus the word "capacity" is said to _designate_ the power of holding; and "finesse" _characterizes_ the people by whom it was adopted.  
See also [nominate](entry://nominate)  
**NAME, REPUTATION, REPUTE, CREDIT.** — _Name_ is here taken in another sense for a name acquired in public by any peculiarity or quality in an object.  
_Reputation_ and _repute_, from _reputo_, or _re_, back, and _putare_, to think, signifies the thinking of or the state of being thought of, or esteemed by, by the public. _Credit_ signifies the state of being believed or trusted in general, from Latin _credere_, to believe or trust.  
_Name_ implies something more specific than _reputation;_ and _reputation_ something more substantial than _name;_ a _name_ may be acquired by some casualty or by some quality that has more show than worth; _reputation_ is acquired only by time and built only on merit: a _name_ may be arbitrarily given, simply by way of distinction; _reputation_ is not given, but acquired, or follows as a consequence of one's honorable exertions. A physician sometimes gets a _name_ by a single instance of professional skill, which by a combination of favorable circumstances he may convert to his own advantage in forming an extensive practice; but unless he have a commensurate degree of talent, this _name_ will never ripen into a solid _reputation. Name_ and _reputation_ are of a more extended nature than _repute_ and _credit._ The _name_ and _reputation_ are given by the public at large; the _repute_ and _credit_ are acquired within a narrow circle. Strangers, or it may be distant countries, hear of the _name_ and the _reputation_ of anything; but only neighbors and those who have the means of personal observation can know its _repute_ and _credit._ It is possible, therefore, to have a _name_ and _reputation_ without having _repute_ and _credit_, and _vice versa_, for the objects which constitute the former are sometimes different from those which produce the latter. A manufacturer has a _name_ for the excellence of a particular article of his own manufacture a book has a _name_ among would-be _connoisseurs_ and pretenders to literature: a good writer, however, seeks to establish his _reputation_ for genius, learning, industry, or some praiseworthy characteristic: a preacher is in high _repute_ among those who attend him: a master gains great _credit_ from the good performances of his scholars. There is also this distinction between _reputation_ and _repute_, that _reputation_ signifies the act of reputing or the state of being reputed, _repute_ signifies only the state of being reputed.  
_Name_ and _repute_ are taken either in a good or bad sense; _reputation_ mostly, and _credit_ always, are taken in the good sense only: a person or thing may get a good or an ill _name;_ a person or thing may be in good or ill _repute; reputation_ may rise to different degrees of height, or it may sink again into nothing; _credit_ may likewise be high or low, but both _reputation_ and _credit_, absolutely taken, imply that which is good.

####natal 
**NATAL, NATIVE, INDIGENOUS.**  
_Natal_, in Latin _natalis_, from _natus_, born, signifies belonging to one's birth, or the act of one's being born; but _native_, in Latin _nativus_, likewise from _natus_, signifies having an origin or beginning. _Indigenous_, in Latin _indigenus_, from _indu_, Old Latin, within, and _genitus_, born, signifies born in a given place.  
The epithet _natal_ is applied only to the circumstances of a man's birth, as his _natal_ day; his _natal_ hour; a _natal_ song; a _natal_ star. _Native_ has a more extensive meaning, as it comprehends the idea of one's relationship by origin to an object; as one's _native_ country, one's _native_ soil, _native_ village, or _native_ place, _native_ language, and the like.  
_Indigenous_ is a particular term used to denote the country where races of men are supposed to have first existed. It is also applied to plants in the same sense.  
**NATIVE, NATURAL.** — _Native_ is to _natural_ as a species to the genus: everything _native_ is, according to its strict signification, _natural;_ but many things are _natural_ which are not _native._ Of a, person we may say that his worth is _native_, to designate that it is some valuable property which is born with him, not foreign to him, or ingrafted upon his character; but we may say of his disposition that it is _natural_, as opposed to that which is acquired or otherwise. The former is mostly employed in a good sense, in opposition to what is artful, assumed, and unreal; the other is used in an indifferent sense, as opposed to whatever is the effect of habit or circumstances. When children display themselves with all their _native_ simplicity, they are interesting objects of notice: when they display their _natural_ turn of mind, it is not always that which tends to raise human nature in our esteem.  
See also [intrinsic](entry://intrinsic)  
**NATURALLY, IN COURSE, CONSEQUENTLY, OF COURSE.** — The connection between events, actions, and things is expressed by all these terms. _Naturally_ signifies according to the _nature_ of things, and applies, therefore, to the connection which exists between events according to the original constitution or inherent properties of things: _in course_ signifies _in_ the _course_ of things, that is, in the regular order that things ought to follow: _consequently_ signifies by a _consequence_, that is, by a necessary law of dependence, which makes one thing follow another: _of course_ signifies on account _of_ the _course_ which things most commonly or even necessarily take. Whatever happens _naturally_ happens as it should do; whatever happens _in course_, or _in_ due _course_, happens as we establish it: whatever follows _consequently_ follows as we judge it logical; whatever follows _of course_ follows as we expect it. Children _naturally_ imitate their parents: people _naturally_ fall into the habits of those they associate with: both these circumstances result from the _nature_ of things: whoever is made a peer of the realm takes his seat in the upper house _in course;_ he requires no other qualifications to entitle him to this privilege, he goes thither according to the established _course_ of things; _consequently_, as a peer, he is admitted without question; this is a decision of the judgment by which the question is at once determined: _of course_ none are admitted who are not peers; this results necessarily from the constituted law of the land.

####naturalize 
**NATURALIZE, ACCLIMATE, ORIENT.**  
These words all mean to become at home in a new country. But _naturalize_, from the very beginning when it was coined as French _naturaliser_, has meant to acquire the standing of a _natural_-born citizen, to be placed on the same footing before law as a _native_ of the country. It is sometimes used with an extended application to refer to the adaptation of plants, etc., to a new country. _Acclimate_ means to become accustomed to the _climate_ of a new country. It may also be used figuratively in an extended sense to mean simply to become accustomed to. _Orient_ is used as a verb to mean to adjust to new conditions — from French _s'orienter._ It referred originally to the placing of churches so that the altar was at the east (Latin _oriens_, the place of the rising sun); hence it came to mean to place with reference to the points of the compass; to get one's bearings.

####necessary 
**NECESSARY, EXPEDIENT, ESSENTIAL, REQUISITE.**  
For _necessary_ see **necessity** under [necessary](entry://necessary). _Expedient_ comes from Latin _ex_, out, and _pedem_ (accusative), foot, and signified originally taking the foot out, hence aiding movement and action. _Essential_ means containing that essence or property which cannot be omitted, from Latin _essentia_, being, derived from a supposititious stem from esse, the infinitive of the verb to be. _Requisite_ signifies literally required (see [demand](entry://demand)).  
_Necessary_ is a general and indefinite term; things may be _necessary_ in the course of nature; it is _necessary_ for all men once to die; or things may be _necessary_ according to the circumstances of the case, or our views of _necessity;_ in this manner we conceive it _necessary_ to call upon another. _Expedient, essential_, and _requisite_ are modes of relative _necessity:_ the _expediency_ of a thing is a matter of discretion and calculation, and therefore not so self-evidently _necessary_ as many things which we so denominate: it may be _expedient_ for a person to consult another, or it may not, according as circumstances may present themselves. The _requisite_ and the _essential_ are more obviously _necessary_ than the _expedient;_ but the former is less so than the latter: what is _requisite_ may be _requisite_ only in part or entirely; it may be _requisite_ to complete a thing when begun, but not to begin it; the _essential_, on the contrary, is that which constitutes the _essence_, and without which a thing cannot exist. It is _requisite_ for one who would have a good library to select only the best authors; exercise is _essential_ for the preservation of good health. In all matters of dispute it is _expedient_ to be guided by some impartial judge; it is _requisite_ for every member of the community to contribute his share to the public expenditure as far as he is able: it is _essential_ to a teacher to know more than those he teaches.  
**NECESSITIES, NECESSARIES.** — _Necessity_, in Latin _necessitas_, and _necessary_, in Latin _necessarius_, from _necesse_, signify that which is indispensable. _Necessity_ is the mode or state of circumstances or the thing which circumstances render _necessary;_ the _necessary_ is that which is absolutely and unconditionally _necessary._ Art has ever been busy in inventing things to supply the various _necessities_ of our nature, and yet there are always numbers who want even the first _necessaries_ of life. Habit and desire create _necessities;_ nature only requires _necessaries:_ a voluptuary has _necessities_ which are unknown to a temperate man; the poor have in general little more than _necessaries._  
**NECESSITY, NEED.** — _Necessity_ (see [necessary](entry://necessary)). _Need_ is in Anglo-Saxon _nied_, and is the native English word corresponding to the Latin word _necessitas. Necessity_ implies the thing wanted; _need_ the condition of the person wanting. There would be no _necessity_ for punishments if there were not evildoers; he is peculiarly fortunate who finds a friend in time of _need. Necessity_ is more pressing than _need:_ the former places one in a positive state of compulsion to act; it is said to have no law, it prescribes the law for itself; the latter yields to circumstances and leaves in a state of deprivation. We are frequently under the _necessity_ of going without that of which we stand most in _need._  
From these two nouns arise two epithets for each, which are worthy of observation, namely, _necessary_ and _needful, necessitous_ and _needy. Necessary_ and _needful_ are both applicable to the thing wanted; _necessitous_ and _needy_ to the person wanting: _necessary_ is applied to every object indiscriminately; _needful_ only to such objects as supply temporary or partial wants. Exercise is _necessary_ to preserve the health of the body; restraint is _necessary_ to preserve that of the mind; assistance is _needful_ for one who has not sufficient resources in himself: it is _necessary_ to go by water to the Continent: money is _needful_ for one who is travelling. The dissemination of knowledge is _necessary_ to dispel the ignorance which would otherwise prevail in the world; it is _needful_ for a young person to attend to the instructions of his teacher, if he wishes to improve.  
_Necessitous_ and _needy_ are both applied to persons in want of something important; but _necessitous_ may be employed to denote an occasional want, as to be in a _necessitous_ condition in a foreign country for want of remittances from home; _needy_ denotes a permanent state of want, as to be _needy_ either from extravagance or misfortune. 

####necessitate 
See [compel](entry://compel)

####necropolis 
**NECROPOLIS, BURIAL-GROUND, CEMETERY, GRAVEYARD, MORTUARY.**  
These words all indicate places where the dead are laid away. _Burial-ground_ and _graveyard_ are the native English terms; of these two _graveyard_ is the more familiar word. It has more intimate and solemn associations than the analogous term _burial-ground._ We speak of the _burial-ground_ of the Indians, for instance, in indicating an object of merely archaeological interest. We speak of an English _graveyard_ with some sympathetic realization of what it has meant to a community of people like ourselves. _Cemetery_, from Latin _cœmeterium_, Greek _κοιμητήριον_, a sleeping-place, is a term which has largely replaced the older term _graveyard_ in ordinary speech now. Being a more modern and sophisticated term, it naturally has somewhat different connotations. We should speak of an old _burial-ground_ in a little town as a _graveyard;_ of the park-like _burial-grounds_ in or near our cities as _cemeteries._ But this distinction is not always observed. _Necropolis_, from Greek _νεκρός_, dead, and _πόλις_, a city, means literally a city of the dead. It is a term applied to large and elaborate cemeteries near cities, or to burial-places of special dignity. _Mortuary_, from Latin _mortuus_, dead, is the term applied to a building or a room where dead bodies are kept for a time. 

####nefarious 
See [wicked](entry://wicked)

####neglect 
**NEGLECT, OMIT.**  
_Neglect_ (see [disregard](entry://disregard)). _Omit_, in Latin _omitto_, or _ob_ and _mitto_, signifies to put aside.  
The idea of letting pass or slip, or of not using, is comprehended in the signification of both these terms; the former is, however, a culpable, the latter an indifferent action. What we _neglect_ ought not to be _neglected:_ but what we _omit_ may be _omitted_ or otherwise, as convenience requires.  
These terms differ likewise in the objects to which they are applied; that is _neglected_ which is practicable or serves for action; that is _omitted_ which serves for intellectual purposes: we _neglect_ an opportunity, we _neglect_ the means, the time, the use, and the like; we _omit_ a word, a sentence, a figure, a stroke, a circumstance, and the like.  
**NEGLIGENT, REMISS, CARELESS, THOUGHTLESS, HEEDLESS, INATTENTIVE.** — _Negligence_ (see [disregard](entry://disregard)) and _remissness_ concern the outward action: _careless, heedless, thoughtless_, and _inattentive_ the state of mind.  
_Negligence_ and _remissness_ consist in not doing what ought to be done; _carelessness_ and the other mental defects may show themselves in doing wrong, as well as in not doing at all; _negligence_ and _remissness_ are, therefore, to _carelessness_ and the others as the effect to the cause; for no one is so apt to be _negligent_ and _remiss_ as he who is _careless_, although _negligence_ and _remissness_ arise from other causes, and _carelessness, thoughtlessness_, etc., produce likewise other effects. _Negligent_ is a stronger term than _remiss:_ one is _negligent_ in _neglecting_ the tiling that is expressly before one's eyes; one is _remiss_ in forgetting that which was enjoined some time previously: the want of will renders a person _negligent;_ the want of interest renders a person _remiss:_ one is _negligent_ in regard to business, and the _performance_ of bodily labor; one is _remiss_ in duty, or in such things as require mental exertion. Servants are commonly _negligent_ in what concerns their master's interest; teachers are _remiss_ in not correcting the faults of their pupils. _Negligence_, therefore, is the fault of persons of all descriptions, but particularly those in low condition; _remissness_ is a fault peculiar to those in a more elevated station: a clerk in an office is _negligent_ in not making proper memorandums; a magistrate, or the head of an institution, is _remiss_ in the exercise of his authority to check irregularities.  
_Careless_ denotes the want of care in the manner of doing things; _thoughtless_ denotes the want of thought or reflection about things; _heedless_ denotes the want of heeding or regarding — things; _inattentive_ denotes the want of attention to things. One is _careless_ only in trivial matters of behavior; one is _thoughtless_ in matters of greater moment, in what concerns the conduct. _Carelessness_ leads children to make mistakes in their mechanical exercises, in whatever they commit to memory or to paper; _thoughtlessness_ leads many who are not children into serious errors of conduct, when they do not think of, or bear in mind, the consequences of then actions. _Thoughtless_ is applied to things past, present, or to come; _careless_ to things present or to come.  
_Careless_ is applied to such things as require permanent care; _thoughtless_ to such as require permanent thought; _heedless_ and _inattentive_ are applied to passing objects that engage the senses or the thoughts of the moment. One is _careless_ in business, _thoughtless_ in conduct, _heedless_ in walking or running, _inattentive_ in listening: _heedless_ children are unfit to go by themselves; _inattentive_ children are unfit to be led by others. 

####negotiate 
**NEGOTIATE, TREAT, TRANSACT.**  
The idea of conducting business with others is included in the signification of all these terms; but they differ in the mode of conducting it and the nature of the business to be conducted. _Negotiate_, from Latin _negotium_ (from _neg_ — for _ne_ — not, and _otium_, leisure, signifying that which one does when one is not at leisure — _i.e._, business), is applied in the original mostly to merchandise or traffic, but it is more commonly employed in the complicated concerns of governments and nations. _Treat_, from the Latin _tractare_, frequentative of _trahere_, to draw, signifies to turn over and over or set forth in all ways: these two verbs, therefore, suppose deliberation; but _transact_, from _transactus_, participle of _transago_, to carry forward or bring to an end, supposes more direct agency than consultation or deliberation; this latter is therefore adapted to the more ordinary and less entangled concerns of commerce. A congress carries on _negotiations_ for the establishment of good order among different states; individual states _treat_ with each other to settle their particular differences. To _negotiate_ mostly applies to political concerns, except in the case of _negotiating_ bills: to _treat_, as well as _transact_, is said of domestic and private concerns: we _treat_ with a person about the purchase of a house, and _transact_ our business with him by making good the purchase and paying down the money.  
As nouns, _negotiation_ expresses rather the act of deliberating than the thing deliberated: _treaty_ includes the ideas of the terms proposed and the arrangement of those terms: _transaction_ expresses the idea of something actually done and finished. _Negotiations_ are sometimes very long pending before the preliminary terms are even proposed or any basis is defined; _treaties_ of commerce are entered into by all civilized countries, in order to obviate misunderstandings and enable them to preserve an amicable intercourse; the _transactions_ which daily pass in a great metropolis like that of London are of so multifarious a nature, and so infinitely numerous, that the bare contemplation of them fills the mind with astonishment. _Negotiations_ are long or short; _treaties_ are advantageous or the contrary; _transactions_ are honorable or dishonorable.

####neighborhood 
**NEIGHBORHOOD, VICINITY.**  
_Neighborhood_, from _neighbor_ (Anglo-Saxon _neah_, nigh, near, and _gebur_ or _bur_, a husbandman, the same word as  
Dutch _Boer_, English _boor)_, signified originally the place near by where other farmers live. _Vicinity_, from _vicus_, a village, signifies the place which does not exceed in distance the extent of a village.  
_Neighborhood_, which is of Saxon origin, is employed in reference to the inhabitants, or in regard to inhabited places, to denote nearness of persons to each other or to objects in general: but _vicinity_, which in Latin bears the same acceptation as _neighborhood_, is employed in English to denote nearness of one object to another, whether person or thing; hence the propriety of saying a populous _neighborhood_, a quiet _neighborhood_, a respectable _neighborhood_, a pleasant _neighborhood_, and to be in the _neighborhood_, either as it signifies the people or the country; but to live in the _vicinity_ of a manufactory, to be in the _vicinity_ of the metropolis or of the sea. 

####neophyte 
See [tyro](entry://tyro)

####neutral 
**NEUTRAL, IMPARTIAL, INDIFFERENT.**  
These words all indicate a disposition not to take sides in a quarrel, but they differ in the amount of sympathy for the combatants implied in them. _Indifferent_ signified originally not making a distinction or difference between things — implying such a lack of sympathy or interest that one thing seems much like another. Here it indicates a lack of interest in either combatant. _Neutral_, from Latin _ne_, not, and _uter_, which of two, means not asking which is right. It implies complete intellectual detachment, but not necessarily lack of sympathy for one or both of the parties. It is the term applied to the non-combatant nations in time of war. _Impartial_ means not taking the part of either side. By derivation it has the same meaning as the other words, but it implies distinct sympathy with one or both combatants, which is not allowed to influence judgment. 

####nevertheless 
See [however](entry://however)

####new 
**NEW, NOVEL, MODERN, FRESH, RECENT.**  
_New_, from Anglo-Saxon _neowe_ is the native English word corresponding to Latin _novus_, whence _novel_ is derived. _Modern_ signifies belonging to the present _mode_, from Latin _modus_, manner. _Fresh_ is derived from a Teutonic root which appears in Anglo-Saxon _fersc_, fresh; but its form is due to the feminine form of this same word in Old French — _freis_, masculine, _fresche_, feminine.  
All these epithets are applied to what has not long existed; _new_ expresses this idea simply without any qualification; _novel_ is something strange or unexpected; the _modern_ is the thing of today as distinguished from that which existed in former time; the _fresh_ is that which is so _new_ as not to be the worse for use, or that which has not been before used or employed; the _recent_ is that which is so _new_ as to appear as if it were just made or done. According to this distinction, _new_ is most aptly applied to such things as may be permanent or durable, as _new_ houses, _new_ buildings, _new_ clothes, and the like; in such cases it is properly opposed to the old; the term may, however, be applied generally to whatever arises or comes first into existence or notice, as _new_ scenes, _new_ sights, _new_ sounds.  
_Novel_ may be applied to whatever is either never or but rarely seen; the freezing of the river Thames is a _novelty;_ but the frost in every winter is something _new_ when it first comes.  
_Modern_ is applied to that which is _new_, or springs up in the day or age in which we live; as _modern_ books, _modern_ writers, _modern_ science; a book is _new_ which is just formed into a book and has not been used; it is _modem_ at the time when it is first published; so likewise principles are _new_ which have never been broached before; they are _modern_ if they have been published lately or within a given period: the _modern_ is opposed to the ancient.  
_Fresh_ is said of that which may lose its color, vigor, or other perfection; as a _fresh_ flower, the _freshness_ of youth, etc.  
So pleasures or passions are _fresh_ which have not lost their power by satiety; they are _new_ if they have but just sprung into activity.  
_Recent_ is applied to those events or circumstances which have just happened, as a _recent_ transaction, or an occurrence of _recent_ date.  
**NEWS, TIDINGS.** — _News_ implies anything _new_ that is related or circulated; _tidings_, in its Anglo-Saxon form, meant simply anything that happened; but it acquired the Scandinavian sense of _news_, especially _news_ that arrived in due time and season, that is timely. _News_ is unexpected; it serves to gratify idle curiosity: _tidings_ are expected; they serve to allay anxiety. In time of war the public are eager for _news;_ and they who have relatives in the army are anxious to have _tidings_ of them.

####nightly 
**NIGHTLY, NOCTURNAL.**  
_Nightly_, immediately from the word _night_, and _nocturnal_, from _nox_, night, signify belonging to the night, or the night season; the former is therefore more familiar than the latter: we speak of _nightly_ depredations to express what passes every night, or _nightly_ disturbances, _nocturnal_ dreams, _nocturnal_ visits.

####ninny 
**NINNY, NINCOMPOOP.**  
These are slang or colloquial terms meaning a simpleton, and are not clearly distinguished from one another. _Ninny_ comes probably from Italian _ninna_, a lullaby to put a child to sleep, based on _ninno_, child. The origin of _nincompoop_ is supposed to be due to a vitiation of the Latin phrase _non compos mentis._ These words have been in the English language for centuries, but are so little differentiated from one another that it would be pedantry to make a distinction. Possibly _ninny_ suggests more of silliness; _nincompoop_ more of obtuseness, dulness. 

####nip 
**NIP, BITE, PINCH.**  
A _nip_ is something between a _bite_ and a _pinch._ In _biting_ the substance taken between the teeth is cut; in _pinching_, which usually refers to a pressure upon a substance caught between two fingers or an instrument acting like the two fingers, it is simply bruised. To _nip_ is to give a sharp, quick _pinch._

####noble 
**NOBLE, GRAND.**  
_Noble_, in Latin _nobilis_, from _nosco_, to know, signifying knowable, or worth knowing, is a term of general import; it simply implies the quality by which a thing is distinguished for excellence above other things: the _grand_ (see [grandeur](entry://grandeur)) is, properly speaking, one of those qualities by which an object acquires the name of _noble;_ but there are many _noble_ objects which are not denominated _grand._ A building may be denominated _noble_ for its beauty as well as its size; but a _grand_ building is rather so called for the expense which is displayed upon it in the style of building. A family may be either _noble_ or _grand;_ but it is _noble_ by birth; it is _grand_ by wealth and an expensive style of living. _Nobleness_ of acting or thinking comprehends all moral excellence that rises to a high pitch; but _grandeur_ of mind is peculiarly applicable to such actions or traits as denote an elevation of character, rising above all that is common. 

####nocturnal 
See [nightly](entry://nightly)

####noise 
**NOISE, CRY, OUTCRY, CLAMOR.**  
_Noise_ is any loud sound; _cry, outcry_, and _clamor_ are particular kinds of noises, differing either in the cause or the nature of the sounds. A noise proceeds either from animate or inanimate objects; the _cry_ proceeds only from animate objects. The report of a cannon and the loud sounds occasioned by a high wind are noises, but not _cries; cries_ issue from birds, beasts, and men. A _noise_ is produced often by accident; a _cry_ is always occasioned by some particular circumstance: when many horses and carriages are going together they make a great _noise;_ hunger and pain cause _cries_ to proceed both from animals and human beings. _Noise_, when compared with _cry_, is sometimes only an audible sound; the _cry_ is a very loud _noise;_ whatever disturbs silence, as the proverbial falling of a pin in a perfectly still assembly, is denominated a _noise;_ but a _cry_ is that which may often drown other _noises_, as the _cries_ of people selling things about the streets.  
A _cry_ is in general a definite sound, but _outcry_ and _clamor_ are irregular sounds; the former may proceed from one or many, the latter from many in conjunction. A _cry_ after a thief becomes an _outcry_ when set up by many at a time; it becomes a _clamor_ if accompanied with shouting, bawling, and _noises_ of a mixed and tumultuous nature.  
These terms may all be taken in an improper as well as a proper sense. Whatever is obtruded upon the public notice, so as to become the universal subject of conversation and writing, is said colloquially to make a _noise;_ in this manner a new and good performer at the theatre makes a _noise_ on his first appearance.  
A _noise_ may be either for or against; but a _cry, outcry_, and _clamor_ are always against the object, varying in the degree and manner in which they display themselves: _cry_ implies less than _outcry_, and this less than _clamor._ When the public voice is raised in an audible manner against any particular matter it is a _cry;_ if it be mingled with intemperate language it is an _outcry;_ if it be vehement and exceedingly _noisy_ it is a _clamor:_ partisans raise a _cry_ in order to form a body in their favor; the discontented are ever ready to set up an _outcry_ against men in power; a _clamor_ for peace in time of war is easily raised by those who wish to thwart the government.

####nominate 
**NOMINATE, NAME.**  
_Nominate_ comes from Latin _nomen_, name; _name_ (see [name](entry://name)). To _nominate_ and to _name_ are both to mention by _name;_ but the former is to mention for a specific purpose; the latter is to mention for a general purpose: persons only are _nominated;_ things as well as persons are _named:_ one _nominates_ a person in order to propose him, or appoint him, to an office; but one _names_ a person casually, in the course of conversation, or one _names_ him in order to make some inquiry respecting him. To be _nominated_ is a public act; to be _named_ is generally private: one is _nominated_ before an assembly; one is _named_ in any place: to be _nominated_ is always an honor; to be _named_ is either honorable or the contrary, according to the circumstances under which it is mentioned: a person is _nominated_ for an office; he is _named_ whenever he is spoken of.

####normal 
**NORMAL, TYPICAL.**  
_Normal_ and _typical_ are both words which are commonly misused. They are taken to mean _average, ordinary_, whereas they really mean the reverse. The _normal_ person is one that conforms to the _norm_, Latin _norma_, a carpenter's rule; that is to say, to the standard of humanity in any or all respects. This _standard_, however, is not obtained by taking the average of all people. As is shown by the medical standard in accordance with which the candidates for the army are tested, only one in four or five men corresponds sufficiently to the standard. _Normal_ indicates what people would be if then development were not in any way hindered. _Typical_, from Greek _τύπος_, a mark, blow, stamp, has the same meaning as _normal_, with a slight difference of connotation in ordinary usage. A _typical_ man is one who represents the standard to which others approximate more or less. The _typical_ American is not the average or ordinary American. He is the one who represents the distinctive characteristics of Americans in their most characteristic form. _Normal_ is generally used with reference to a particular standard — a standard of health, for instance. _Typical_ is used with reference to distinguishing characteristics. A _normal_ physique, for instance, is one that corresponds to the general standard, one that every one ought to have. A _typical_ soldier's physique is one that represents the characteristics of the soldier unmodified by other influences.

####noted 
**NOTED, NOTORIOUS**.   
_Noted_ (see **distinguished** under [distinguish](entry://distinguish)) may be employed either in a good or a bad sense; _notorious_ is never used but in a bad sense: men may be _noted_ for then talents or their eccentricities; they are _notorious_ for their vices: _noted_ characters excite many and divers remarks from their friends and their enemies; _notorious_ characters are universally shunned. 

####nothing 
See [zero](entry://zero)

####notice 
**NOTICE, REMARK, OBSERVE.**  
To _notice_ (see [attend](entry://attend)) is either to take or to give _notice:_ to _remark_, compounded of _re_ and _mark_ (see [mark](entry://mark)), signifies to reflect or bring back any _mark_ to our own mind, or communicate the same to another; to _mark_ is to _mark_ a thing once, but to _remark_ is to _mark_ it again. _Observe_ (see **looker-on** under [look](entry://look)) signifies either to keep a thing present before one's own view or to communicate one's view to another.  
In the first sense of these words, as the action concerns ourselves, to _notice_ and _remark_ require simple attention, to _observe_ requires examination. To _notice_ is a more cursory action than to _remark:_ we may _notice_ a thing by a single glance, or on merely turning our head; but to _remark_ supposes a reaction of the mind on an object; we _notice_ a person passing at any time; but we _remark_ that he goes past every day at the same hour: we _notice_ that the sun sets this evening under a cloud, and we _remark_ that it has done so for several evenings successively, we _notice_ the state of a person's health or his manners in company; we _remark_ his habits and peculiarities in domestic life. What is _noticed_ and _remarked_ strikes on the senses and awakens the mind; what is _observed_ is looked after and sought for: the former are often involuntary acts; we see, hear, and think because the objects obtrude themselves uncalled for; but the latter is intentional as well as voluntary; we see, hear, and think of that which we have watched. We _remark_ things as matters of fact; we _observe_ them in order to judge of them or draw conclusions from them: we _remark_ that the wind lies for a long time in a certain quarter; we _observe_ that whenever it lies in a certain quarter it brings rain with it. People who have no particular curiosity may be sometimes attracted to _notice_ the stairs or planets when they are particularly bright; those who look frequently will _remark_ that the same star does not rise exactly in the same place for two successive nights; but the astronomer goes further and _observes_ all the motions of the heavenly bodies, in order to discover the scheme of the universe.  
In the latter sense of these words, as concerns the communications to others of what passes in our own minds, to _notice_ is to make known our sentiments by various ways; to _remark_ and _observe_ are to make them known only by means of words: to _notice_ is a personal act toward an individual, in which we direct our attention to him, as may happen either by a bow, a nod, a word, or even a look; but to _remark_ and _observe_ are said only of the thoughts which pass in our own minds and are expressed to others: friends _notice_ each other when they meet; they _remark_ to others the impression which passing objects make upon their minds: the _observations_ which intelligent people make are always entitled to _notice_ from young persons.

####nourish 
**NOURISH, NURTURE, CHERISH.**  
To _nourish_ and _nurture_ are but variations from the same verb _nutrio. Cherish_ (see [foster](entry://foster)). Things _nourish_, persons _nurture_ and _cherish:_ to _nourish_ is to build up bodily strength to supply the physical necessities of the body; to _nurture_ is to extend one's care to the supply of all its physical necessities, to preserve life, occasion growth, and increase vigor: the breast of the mother _nourishes;_ the fostering care and attention of the mother _nurtures._ To _nurture_ is a physical act; to _cherish_ is a mental as well as a physical act: a mother _nurtures_ her infant while it is entirely dependent upon her; she _cherishes_ her child in her bosom and protects it from every misfortune, or affords consolation in the midst of all its troubles when it is no longer an infant.

####now 
**NOW, IMMEDIATELY, STRAIGHTWAY.**  
_Now_ is the general term, meaning at this present moment. _Immediately_ suggests more of emphasis and action. It means in the moment following a given moment. _Now_ is static; _immediately_ suggests action, movement. _Straightway_ has the same meaning as _immediately_, but a slightly different connotation. It is a somewhat archaic word associated with Biblical phraseology, and suggestive of poetry or a distinctly literary style. 

####noxious 
See [hurtful](entry://hurtful)

####numb 
**NUMB, BENUMBED, TORPID.**  
_Numb_ and _benumbed_ come from the past participle of Anglo-Saxon _niman_, Middle English _nomen_, to take, and signify overtaken, hence overpowered, unable to move. There are but few things _numb_ by nature, but there may be many things which may be _benumbed. Torpid_, in Latin _torpidus_, from _torpere_, to languish, is most commonly employed to express the permanent state of being _benumbed_, as in the case of some animals, which he in a _torpid_ state all the winter; or, in the moral sense, to depict the _benumbed_ state of the thinking faculty; in this manner we speak of the _torpor_ of persons who are _benumbed_ by any strong affection or by any strong external action.

####obedient 
**OBEDIENT, SUBMISSIVE, OBSEQUIOUS.**  
_Obedient_ (see [dutiful](entry://dutiful)). _Submissive_ denotes the disposition to submit (see [yield](entry://yield)). _Obsequious_, in Latin _obsequius_, from _obsequor_, or the intensive of _ob_, near, and _sequi_, to follow, signifies following diligently and with a fixed intention to please.  
One is _obedient_ to command, _submissive_ to power or the will, _obsequious_ to persons. _Obedience_ is always taken in a good sense; one ought always to be _obedient_ where _obedience_ is due: _submission_ is relatively good; it may, however, be indifferent or bad: one may be _submissive_ from interested motives or meanness of spirit, which is a base kind of _submission;_ but to be _submissive_ for conscience' sake is the bounden duty of a Christian: _obsequiousness_ is never good; it is an excessive concern about the will of another which has always interest for its end. _Obedience_ is a course of conduct conformable either to some specific rule or the express will of another; _submission_ is often a personal act immediately directed to the individual. We show our _obedience_ to the law by avoiding the breach of it; we show our _obedience_ to the will of God, or of our parent, by making that will the rule of our life: on the other hand, we show _submission_ to the person of the magistrate; we adopt a _submissive_ deportment by a downcast look and a bent body. _Obedience_ is founded upon principle and cannot be feigned; _submission_ is a partial bending to another, which is easily affected in our outward behavior: the understanding and the heart produce _obedience;_ but force or the necessity of circumstances gives rise to _submission. Obedience_ and _submission_ suppose a restraint on one's own will, in order to bring it into accordance with that of another; but _obsequiousness_ is the consulting the will or pleasure of another: we are _obedient_ from a sense of right; we are _submissive_ from a sense of necessity; we are _obsequious_ from a desire of gaining favor: a love of God is followed by _obedience_ to His will; they are coincident sentiments that reciprocally act on each other so as to serve the cause of virtue: a _submissive_ conduct is at the worst an involuntary sacrifice of our independence to our fears or necessities, the evil of which is confined principally to the individual who makes the sacrifice; _obsequiousness_ is a voluntary sacrifice of ourselves to others for interested purposes. 

####object 
**OBJECT, SUBJECT.**  
_Object_, in Latin _objectus_, participle of _obicere_, to lie in the way, signifies the thing that lies in one's way. _Subject_, in Latin _subjectus_, participle of _subicere_, to lie under, signifies the thing forming the groundwork.  
The _object_ puts itself forward; the _subject_ is in the background: we notice the _object;_ we observe or reflect on the _subject: objects_ are sensible; the _subject_ is altogether intellectual: the eye, the ear, and all the senses are occupied with the surrounding _objects;_ the memory, the judgment, and the imagination are supplied with _subjects_ suitable to the nature of the operations.  
When _object_ is taken for that which is intellectual, it retains a similar signification; it is the thing that presents itself to the mind; it is seen by the mind's eye: the _subject_, on the contrary, is that which must be sought for, and when found it engages the mental powers: hence we say an _object_ of consideration, an _object_ of delight, an _object_ of concern; a _subject_ of reflection, a _subject_ of mature deliberation, the _subject_ of a poem, the _subject_ of grief, of lamentation, and the like. When the mind becomes distracted by too great a multiplicity of _objects_, it can fix itself on no one individual _object_ with sufficient steadiness to take a survey of it; in like manner, if a child have too many _objects_ set before it for the exercise of its powers, it will acquire a familiarity with none: such things are not fit _subjects_ of discussion.  
See also [aim](entry://aim); **find fault** under [find](entry://find)  
**OBJECT, OPPOSE.** — To _object_ is to cast in the way, to _oppose_, from French _opposer_ (Latin _ob_, against, and Late Latin _pausare_, to place, formed on Greek _πάνσις_, pause), is to place in the way; there is, therefore, very little original difference, except that casting is a more momentary and sudden proceeding, placing is a more premeditated action; which distinction, at the same time, corresponds with the use of the terms in ordinary life: to _object_ to a thing is to propose or start something against it; but to _oppose_ it is to set one's self steadily against it: one _objects_ to ordinary matters that require no reflection; one _opposes_ matters that call for deliberation and afford serious reasons for and against: a parent _objects_ to his child's learning the classics or to his running about the streets; he _opposes his_ marriage when he thinks the connection or the circumstances not desirable.  
**OBJECTION, DIFFICULTY, EXCEPTION.** — _Objection_ (see [demur](entry://demur)) is here a general term; it comprehends both the _difficulty_ and the _exception_, which are but species of the _objection:_ an _objection_ and a _difficulty_ are started; an _exception_ is made: the _objection_ to a thing is in general that which renders it less desirable; but the _difficulty_ is that which renders it less practicable; there is an _objection_ against every scheme which incurs a serious risk: the want of means to begin or resources to carry on a scheme is a serious _difficulty. Objection_ and _exception_ both concern the nature, the moral tendency, or moral consequence of a thing; but an _objection_ may be frivolous or serious; an _exception_ is something serious: the _objection_ is positive; the _exception_ is relatively considered, that is, the thing _excepted_ from other things, as not good, and consequently _objected_ to. _Objections_ are made sometimes to proposals for the mere sake of getting rid of an engagement: those who do not wish to give themselves trouble find an easy method of disengaging themselves, by making _objections_ to every proposition. We take _exception_ at the conduct of others when we think it not sufficiently respectful. 

####objective 
**OBJECTIVE, ACTUAL.**  
_Objective_ signifies outside of consciousness, belonging to that which is presented to consciousness, as opposed to consciousness itself. _Actual_, based on _actus_, past participle of Latin _agere_, to do or act, signifies really existing as distinguished from an idea in the mind — that which is as compared with what we should like to have it. According to these definitions, the two terms seem to have the same meaning, but _objective_ is much more limited in its application than _actual._ That which is _objective_ is simply outside of ourselves; that which is _actual_ is that which really exists. Though, in one sense, _actual_ implies that contrast between the thing beheld and the mind beholding indicated in _objective_, that which is within the mind may also be thought of as _actual._ We speak of "my _actual_ thought, " "my _actual_ feeling" — implying a contrast between reality and unreality within the mind itself. Again that which is _objective_ is not necessarily _actual_ or really existent — as a whole school of philosophers have pointed out. In common speech _actual_ is a word of frequent and various uses; _objective_ is a rather special and scientific term.

####oblong 
**OBLONG, OVAL.**  
_Oblong_, in Latin _oblongus_, from the intensive syllable _ob_, across, or over, signifies very long, longer than it is broad. _Oval_, from the Latin _ovum_, an egg, signifies egg-shaped. The _oval_ is a species of the _oblong:_ what is _oval_ is _oblong;_ but what is _oblong_ is not always _oval. Oblong_ is peculiarly applied to figures formed by right lines, that is, all rectangular parallelograms, except squares, are _oblong;_ but the _oval_ is applied to curvilinear _oblong_ figures, as ellipses, which are distinguished from the circle: tables are oftener _oblong_ than _oval;_ garden beds are as frequently _oval_ as they are _oblong._

####obloquy 
See [reproach](entry://reproach)

####obnoxious 
**OBNOXIOUS, OFFENSIVE.**  
_Obnoxious_, from _ob_, against, or in the way of, and _noxious_, signifies either being in the way of what is noxious or being very noxious or hateful. _Offensive_, from _ob_, against, and a stem _fend_, meaning to dash, signifies apt to give offence or displeasure. The _obnoxious_ conveys more than the _offensive_, implying (though this use is now obsolete) to receive as well as to give offence; a man may be _obnoxious_ to evils as well as _obnoxious_ to persons.  
In the sense of giving offence, _obnoxious_ implies as much as hateful, _offensive_ little more than displeasing: a man is _obnoxious_ to a party to whose interests or principles he is opposed; he may be _offensive_ to an individual merely on account of his manners or any particular actions. Men are _obnoxious_ only to their fellow-creatures, but they may be _offensive_, though not _obnoxious_, to then Maker.  
Persons only are _obnoxious_ to others, things as well as persons are _offensive;_ dust is _offensive_ to the eye; sounds are _offensive_ to the ear; advice, or even one's own thoughts, may be _offensive_ to the mind.

####observation 
**OBSERVATION, OBSERVANCE.**  
These terms derive their use from the different significations of the verb: _observation_ is the act of observing objects with the view to examine them (see [notice](entry://notice)): _observance_ is the act of observing in the sense of keeping or holding sacred (see [keep](entry://keep)). From a minute _observation_ of the human body, anatomists have discovered the circulation of the blood and the source of all the humors; by a strict _observance_ of truth and justice a man acquires the title of an upright man.  
See also [remark](entry://remark)  
**OBSERVE, WATCH.** — _Observe_ (see [guard](entry://guard)). _Watch_ (see [notice](entry://notice))  
These terms agree in expressing the act of looking at an object; but to _observe_ is not to look after so strictly as is implied by to _watch;_ a general _observes_ the motions of an enemy when they are in no particular state of activity; he _watches_ the motions of an enemy when they are in a state of commotion; we _observe_ a thing in order to draw an inference from it: we _watch_ anything in order to discover what may happen: we _observe_ with coolness; we _watch_ with eagerness: we _observe_ carefully; we _watch_ narrowly: the conduct of mankind in general is _observed;_ the conduct of suspicious individuals is _watched._

####obstinate 
**OBSTINATE, CONTUMACIOUS, STUBBORN, HEADSTRONG, HEADY.**  
_Obstinate_, in Latin _obstinatus_, participle of _obstino_, from _ob_ and the stem found in _stare_, to stand, signifies standing in the way of another. _Contumacious_ (see [contumacy](entry://contumacy)). _Stubborn_, Middle English _stoburn_, comes from Anglo-Saxon _stybb_, Modern English _stub_, and signified originally like a stick or stub remaining in the ground; hence not easily moved. _Headstrong_ signifies strong in the head or the mind; and _heady_, inclined, so to speak, to follow one's own head.  
_Obstinacy_ is a habit of the mind; _contumacy_ is either a particular state of feeling or a mode of action; _obstinacy_ consists in an attachment to one's own mode of acting; _contumacy_ consists in contempt of others: the _obstinate_ man adheres tenaciously to his own ways, and opposes reason to reason; the _contumacious_ man disputes the right of another to control his actions, and opposes force to force. _Obstinacy_ interferes with a man's private conduct and makes him blind to reason; _contumacy_ is an offence against lawful authority; the _contumacious_ man sets himself against his superiors: when young people are _obstinate_ they are recalcitrant to education; when grown people are _contumacious_ they are troublesome subjects to the king.  
The _stubborn_ and the _headstrong_ are species of the _obstinate:_ the former lies altogether in the perversion of the will; the latter in the perversion of the judgment: the _stubborn_ person wills what he wills; the _headstrong_ person thinks what he thinks. _Stubbornness_ is mostly inherent in a person's nature; a _headstrong_ temper is commonly associated with violence and impetuosity of character. _Obstinacy_ discovers itself in persons of all ages and stations; a _stubborn_ and _headstrong_ disposition betrays itself mostly in those who are expected to conform to the will of another. _Heady_ may be said of any who are full of conceit and bent upon following their own desires.

####obtuse 
**OBTUSE, BLUNT, DULL.**  
All these words have the same original meaning; they are all opposed to sharp. _Obtuse_ is the opposite of the sharp point of an angle of less than forty-five degrees; _blunt_ (of unknown origin) is the opposite of a sharp point; _dull_ is the opposite of a sharp edge, such as the blade of a knife. _Dull_ and _obtuse_ are also given a mental application (see [dull](entry://dull)), _obtuse_ referring to particular cases of _dullness_, not to the general character indicated by _dull. Blunt_ has a moral application, referring to the manners and disposition of one who is not finely responsive or adaptable to the feelings and conditions of those around him, who offends by rude telling of unsavory truth, etc.

####occasion 
**OCCASION, OPPORTUNITY.**  
_Occasion_, in Latin _occasio_, from _obcasio_, from _ob_, in the way of, and _cadere_, to fall, signifies that which falls in the way so as to produce some change. _Opportunity_, in Latin _opportunitas_, from _opportunus (ob_, near, and _portus_, harbor), signifies near the harbor or in accordance with the desires or needs.  
These terms are applied to the events of life; but the _occasion_ is that which determines our conduct and leaves us no choice; it amounts to a degree of necessity: the _opportunity_ is that which invites to action; it tempts us to embrace the moment for taking the step. We do things, therefore, as the _occasion_ requires, or as the _opportunity_ offers. There are many _occasions_ on which a man is called upon to uphold his opinions. There are but few _opportunities_ for men in general to distinguish themselves.  
**OCCASION, NECESSITY.** — _Occasion_ includes, _necessity_ excludes, the idea of choice or alternative. We are regulated by the _occasion_, and can exercise our own discretion; we yield or submit to the _necessity_, without even the exercise of the will. On the death of a relative we have _occasion_ to go into mourning if we do not wish to offer an affront to the family; but there is no express _necessity:_ in case of an attack on our persons there is a _necessity_ of self-defence for the preservation of life.  
**OCCASIONAL, CASUAL.** — These are both opposed to what is fixed or stated; but _occasional_ carries with it more the idea of infrequency, and _casual_ that of unfixedness, or the absence of all design. A minister is termed an _occasional_ preacher who preaches only on certain _occasions;_ his preaching at a particular place or on a certain day may be _casual._ Our acts of charity may be _occasional_, but they ought not to be _casual._

####occupancy 
**OCCUPANCY, OCCUPATION.**  
These words derive their meaning from the different acceptations of the primitive verb _occupy_, the former being used to express the state of holding or possessing any object, the latter to express the act of taking possession of, or the state of being in possession. He who has the _occupancy_ of land enjoys the fruits of it: the _occupation_ of a country by force of arms is of little avail unless one has an adequate force to maintain one's ground. Both words arc employed in regard to houses and lands, but when the term _occupation_ is taken in the sense of a business it is sufficiently distinguished to need no illustration.

####odd 
**ODD, UNEVEN.**  
_Odd_, in Swedish _udda_, connected with the Dutch _oed_, and German _oede_, empty, deserted, signifying something wanted to match, seems to be a mode of the _uneven;_ both are opposed to the even, but _odd_ is said only of that which has no fellow; the _uneven_ is said of that which does not square or come to an even point: of numbers we say that they are either _odd_ or _uneven;_ but of gloves, shoes, and everything which is made to correspond we say that they are _odd_ when they are single; but that they are _uneven_ when they are both different: in like manner, a plank is _uneven_ which has an unequal surface or disproportionate dimensions; but a piece of wood is _odd_ which will not match or suit with any other piece.

####offence 
**OFFENCE, TRESPASS, TRANSGRESSION, MISDEMEANOR, MISDEED, AFFRONT.**  
_Offence_ is here the general term, signifying merely the act that _offends_ (see [displease](entry://displease)) or runs counter to something else.  
_Offence_ is properly indefinite; it merely implies an object without the least suggestion of the nature of the object; _trespass_ and _transgression_ have a positive reference to an object _trespassed_ upon or _transgressed; trespass_ is contracted from _trans_ and _pass_ (from Latin _passus_, step), that is, a stepping beyond; and _transgress_, from _trans_ and _gressus_ (participle of _gredi)_, a going beyond. The _offence_, therefore, which constitutes a _trespass_ arises out of the laws of property; a passing over or treading upon the property of another is a _trespass:_ the _offence_ which constitutes a _transgression_ derives from the laws of society in general, which fix the boundaries of right and wrong: whoever, therefore, goes beyond or breaks through these bounds is guilty of a _transgression._ The _trespass_ is a species of _offence_ which peculiarly applies to the land or premises of individuals; _transgression_ is a species of moral as well as political evil. Hunters are apt to commit _trespass_ in the eagerness of their pursuit; the passions of men are perpetually misleading them and causing them to commit various _transgressions;_ the term _trespass_ is sometimes employed improperly as regards time and other objects; _transgression_ is always used in one uniform sense as regards rule and law; we _trespass_ upon the time or patience of another; we _transgress_ the moral or civil law.  
An _offence_ is either public or private; a _misdemeanor_, the negative of _demeanor_, is a coined word from French_ de_, Latin _de_, intensive, and French _mener_, to conduct — ultimately from Late Latin _minare_, to drive cattle, from _minari_, to threaten — so that the word meant successively to drive with threats, to lead or conduct, to conduct one's self, and hence came to refer to manners and action. _Misdemeanor_ is properly a private _offence_, although improperly applied for an _offence_ against public law, for it signifies a wrong _demeanor_ or an _offence_ in one's _demeanor_ against propriety; a _misdeed_ is always private, it signifies a wrong _deed_, or a _deed_ which _offends_ against one's duty. _Riotous_ and disorderly behavior in company are serious _misdemeanors;_ every act of drunkenness, lying, fraud, or immorality of every kind, is a _misdeed._  
An _offence_ is that which affects persons or principles, communities or individuals, and is committed either directly or indirectly against the person; an _affront_ (from _ad_, to, and _frontem_, brow) is altogether personal, and is made directly in the presence of the person affronted; it is an _offence_ against another to speak disrespectfully of him in his absence; it is an _affront_ to push past him with violence and rudeness. In this sense, whatever _offence_ is committed against our Maker is properly an _affront;_ and whatever _offends_ Him indirectly may also be denominated an _affront_, as far as His will is opposed and His laws violated.  
**OFFENDER, DELINQUENT.** — The _offender_ is he who _offends_ in anything, either by commission or omission; the _delinquent_ (from _delinquere_, to fail) signifies properly he who fails by omission, but it is extended to signify failing by the violation of a law. Those who go into a wrong place are _offenders;_ those who stay away when they ought to go are _delinquents:_ there are many _offenders_ against the Sabbath who commit violent and open breaches of decorum; there are still more _delinquents_ who never attend a public place of worship.  
**OFFENDING, OFFENSIVE.** — _Offending_ signifies either actually _offending_ or calculated to _offend; offensive_ signifies calculated to _offend_ at all times; a person may be _offending_ in his manners to a particular individual, or use an _offending_ expression on a particular occasion without any imputation on his character; but if his manners are _offensive_, it reflects both on his temper and education.

####offer 
**OFFER, BID, TENDER, PROPOSE.**  
_Offer_ (see [give](entry://give)) is employed for that which is literally transferable, or for that which is indirectly communicable: _bid_ (see [ask](entry://ask)) and _tender_, like the word _tend_, from _tendere_, to stretch, signifying to stretch forth by way of _offering_, belong to _offer_ in the first sense. _Propose_, from French _proposer_, Latin _pro_, before, and French _poser_, to place (from Late Latin _pausare_, Greek _παυσις, not_ from Latin _ponere)_, to place or set before, likewise characterizes a mode of _offering_, and belongs to _offer_ in the latter sense. To _offer_ is a voluntary and discretionary act; an _offer_ may be accepted or rejected at pleasure; to _bid_ and _tender_ are specific modes of _offering_ which depend on circumstances: one _bids_ with the hope that one's offer will be accepted; one _tenders_ from a prudential motive and in order to serve specific purposes. We _offer_ money to a poor person as an act of charity or good-nature; we _bid_ a price for the purchase of a house, as a commercial dealing subject to the rules of commerce; we _tender_ a sum of money by way of payment, as a matter of discretion in order to fulfil an obligation. By the same rule one _offers_ a person the use of one's horse; one _bids_ a sum at an auction; one _tenders_ one's services to the government.  
To _offer_ and _propose_ are both employed in matters of practice or speculation; but the former is a less definite and decisive act than the latter; we _offer_ an opinion by way of promoting a discussion; we _propose_ a plan for the deliberation of others. Sentiments which differ widely from the major part of those present ought to be _offered_ with modesty and caution; we should not _propose_ to another what we would be unwilling to do ourselves. We commonly _offer_ by way of obliging; we commonly _propose_ by way of arranging or accommodating. It is an act of puerility to _offer_ to do more than one is enabled to perform; it does not evince a sincere disposition for peace to _propose_ such terms as we know cannot be accepted.  
**OFFERING, OBLATION.** — _Offering_, from _offer_, and _oblation_, from _oblatio_ and _oblatus_, come both from _offero_, the one from the infinitive, the other from the past participle. The former is, however, a term of much more general and familiar use than the latter. _Offerings_ are both moral and religious; _oblation_ is religious only; the money which is put into the sacramental plate is an _offering;_ the consecrated bread and wine at the sacrament are an _oblation._ The _offering_ in a religious sense is whatever one _offers_ as a gift by way of reverence to a superior; the _oblation_ is the _offering_ which is accompanied with some particular ceremony. The wise men made an _offering_ to our Saviour, but not properly an _oblation;_ the Jewish sacrifices, as in general all religious sacrifices, were in the proper sense _oblations._

####office 
**OFFICE, PLACE, CHARGE, FUNCTION.**  
_Office_, in Latin, _officium_, from _officio_, signifies either the duty performed or the situation in which the duty is performed. _Place_ comprehends no idea of duty, for there may be sinecure _places_ which are only nominal _offices_ and designate merely a relationship with the government: every _office_, therefore, of a public nature is in reality a _place_, yet every _place_ is not an _office._ The _place_ of secretary of state is likewise an _office_, but that of ranger of a park is a _place_ only, and not always an _office._ An _office_ is held; a _place_ is filled: the _office_ is given or intrusted to a person; the _place_ is granted or conferred: the _office_ reposes a confidence and imposes a responsibility; the _place_ gives credit and influence: the _office_ is bestowed on a man from his qualification; the _place_ is granted to him by favor or as a reward for past services; the _office_ is more or less honorable; the _place_ is more or less profitable.  
In an extended application of the terms _office_ and _place_, the latter has a much lower signification than that of the former, since the _office_ is always connected with the state or is something responsible; but the _place_ may be a _place_ for menial labor: the _offices_ are multiplied in time of war; the _places_ for domestic service are more numerous in a state of peace and prosperity. The _office_ is frequently taken not with any reference to the _place_ occupied, but simply to the thing done; this brings it nearer in signification to the term _charge_ (see [care](entry://care)). An _office_ imposes a task or some performance: a _charge_ imposes a responsibility; we have always something to do in an _office_, always something to look after in a _charge;_ the _office_ is either public or private, the _charge_ is always of a private and personal nature: a person performs the _office_ of a magistrate or of a minister; he undertakes the _charge_ of instructing youth or of being a guardian, or of conveying a person's property from one place to another.  
The _office_ is that which is assigned by another; _function_ is properly the act of discharging or completing an _office_ or business, from _functus_, participle of _fungor, viz., finem_ and _ago_, to put an end to or bring to a conclusion; it is extended in its acceptation to the office itself or the thing done. In its strict sense, therefore, the _office_ is performed only by conscious or intelligent agents who act according to their instructions; the _function_, on the other hand, is an operation either of unconscious or of conscious agents acting according to a given rule. The _office_ of a herald is to proclaim public events or to communicate circumstances from one public body to another: a minister performs has _functions_, or the body performs its _functions._  
The word _office_ is sometimes employed in the same application by the personification of nature, which assigns an _office_ to the ear, to the tongue, to the eye, and the like. In this case the word _office_ is applied to what is occasional or partial; _function_ to that which is habitual and essential. When the frame becomes overpowered by a sudden shock, the tongue will frequently refuse to perform its _office;_ when the animal _functions_ are impeded for a length of time, the vital power ceases to exist.

####offspring 
**OFFSPRING, PROGENY, ISSUE.**  
_Offspring_ is that which springs from; _progeny_, that which is brought forth or out of; _issue_, that which _issues_ or proceeds from; all used in relation to the family or generation of the human species. _Offspring_ is a familiar term applicable to one or many children; _progeny_ is employed only as a collective noun for a number; _issue_ is used in an indefinite manner without particular regard to number. When we speak of the children themselves we denominate them the _offspring;_ when we speak of the parents, we denominate the children their _progeny._ A child is said to be the only _offspring_ of his parents, or he is said to be the _offspring_ of low parents; a man is said to have a numerous or a healthy _progeny_, or to leave his _progeny_ in circumstances of honor and prosperity. The _issue_ is said only in regard to a man that is deceased: he dies with male or female _issue_, with or without _issue;_ his property descends to his male _issue_ in a direct line. 

####often 
**OFTEN, FREQUENTLY.**  
_Often_, or its contracted form _oft_, is an English word of unknown origin. _Frequently_, from Latin _frequens_, crowded or numerous, signifies a plurality or number of objects.  
An ignorant man _often_ uses a word without knowing what it means; ignorant people _frequently_ mistake the meaning of the words they hear. A person goes out very _often_ in the course of a week; he has _frequently_ six or seven persons to visit him in the course of that time. By doing a thing _often_ it becomes habitual: we _frequently_ meet the same persons in the route which we _often_ take. 

####old 
**OLD, ANCIENT, ANTIQUE, ANTIQUATED, OLD-FASHIONED, OBSOLETE.**  
_Old_, in Anglo-Saxon _eald_, is perhaps from a root signifying to nourish, found in the word _alma_, fostering, in our phrase _alma mater. Ancient_, in French _ancien_, Late Latin _antianus_ and _antique, antiquated_, all come from the Latin _ante_, before, signifying in general before our time. _Old-fashioned_ signifies after an _old fashion. Obsolete_ comes from the Latin verb _obsolescere_, to decay.  
_Old_ signifies what has long existed and still exists; _ancient_, what existed at a distant period, but does not necessarily exist at present; _antique_, that which has been long _ancient_, and of which there remain but faint traces; _antiquated, old-fashioned_, and _obsolete_, that which has ceased to be any longer used or esteemed. A _fashion_ is _old_ when it has been long in use; a custom is _ancient_ when its use has long been past; a bust or statue is _antique_ when the model of it only remains; a person looks _antiquated_ whose dress and appearance are out of date; manners which have gone quite out of _fashion_ are _old-fashioned;_ a word or custom is _obsolete_ which has grown out of use.  
The _old_ is opposed to the new; some things are the worse for being _old_, other things are the better. _Ancient_ and _antique_ are opposed to modern: all things are valued the more for being _ancient_ or _antique;_ hence we esteem the writings of the _ancients_ above those of the moderns. The _antiquated_ is opposed to the customary and established; it is that which we cannot like, because we cannot esteem it: the _old-fashioned_ is opposed to the fashionable: there is much in the _old-fashioned_ to like and esteem; there is much that is ridiculous in the fashion: the _obsolete_ is opposed to the current; the _obsolete_ may be good; the current may be vulgar and mean.

####olio 
**OLIO, FARRAGO, HODGE-PODGE.**  
These are terms borrowed from various languages signifying a mixed food of some sort, and hence, figuratively, any _jumble_ or _mixture._ They differ from each other in the exact character of the mixed dish indicated and in the frequency and extent of their use as figurative terms. _Olio_, a mistaken form for _olia_, is intended to represent Spanish _olla_, Latin _olla_, a round earthen pot or dish, and hence that which is frequently served in the dish — _i.e._, a mixture of different kinds of meat and vegetables. _Farrago_ is a mixed food served to cattle. _Hodge-podge_ is a corruption of _hotch-pot_, from French _hocher_, to shake, and _pot_ (Anglo-Saxon _pott)._ The Scotch form of _hodge-podge_, besides implying a mixture of various ingredients, means a thick broth of meat and vegetables. Of these three terms _hodge-podge_ is the only one which has come into general colloquial use. 

####omen 
**OMEN, PROGNOSTIC, PRESAGE.**  
All these terms express some token or sign of what is to come. _Omen_, in Latin _omen, prognostic_, in Greek _προγνωστικόν_, from _πρό_, before, and _γνοστικός_, good at knowing, signifies the sign by which one judges a thing beforehand, because a _prognostic_ is rather a deduction by the use of the understanding. _Presage_ (see [augur](entry://augur)).  
The _omen_ and _prognostic_ are both drawn from external objects; the _presage_ is drawn from one's own feelings. The _omen_ is drawn from objects that have no necessary connection with the thing they are made to represent; it is the fruit of the imagination and rests on superstition: the _prognostic_, on the contrary, is a sign which partakes in some degree of the quality of the thing denoted. _Omens_ were drawn by the heathens from the flight of birds or the entrails of beasts — _"Aves dant omina dira, "_ TIBULLUS — and often from different incidents; thus Ulysses, when landed on his native island, prayed to Jupiter that he would give him a double sign by which he might know that he should be permitted to slay the suitors of his wife; and when he heard the thunder and saw a maiden supplicating the gods in the temple he took these for _omens_ that he should immediately proceed to put in execution his designs. _Prognostics_ are discovered only by an acquaintance with the objects in which they exist, as the _prognostics_ of a mortal disease are known to none so well as the physician; the _prognostics_ of a storm or tempest are best known to the mariner.  
In an extended sense, the word _omen_ is also applied to objects which serve as a sign, so as to enable a person to draw a rational inference, which brings it nearer in sense to the _prognostic_ and _presage;_ but the _omen_ may be said of that which is either good or bad; the _prognostic_ and _presage_, when it expresses a sentiment, mostly of that which is unfavorable. It is an _omen_ of our success if we find those of whom we have to ask a favor in a good humor; the spirit of discontent which pervades the countenances and discourse of a people is a _prognostic_ of some popular commotion. The imagination is often filled with strange _presages._ When _presage is_ taken for the outward sign, it is understood favorably, or in an indifferent sense.

####omniscient 
**OMNISCIENT, ALL-KNOWING, ALL-SEEING, ALL-WISE, INFALLIBLE.**  
_Omniscient_, a Latin compound of _omnis_, all, and _sciens_, knowing, from _scio_, to know, in French _omniscient_, Spanish _omnisciente_, is the adjective form of _omniscience_, one of three attributes of God, the others being _omnipresence_, everywhere, and _omnipotence_, infinite power: it signifies universal, unbounded, infinite knowledge and infinite wisdom. In the application of the terms to God, the only proper one, _all-wise_, implies the quality we accord Him of possessing all the wisdom that has ever existed or ever can exist; _all-knowing_, the quality of possession of the fullest possible knowledge of all things; _all-seeing_, literally, the quality of seeing every person and thing; as a substantive, the Being who alone can see all persons and things — God; and _infallible_, the quality of being supremely perfect, incapable of erring or failing in anything, of being at all times and under all conditions certain, sure, and indisputable.  
See also [infallible](entry://infallible)

####on 
**ON, UPON.**  
There is now little difference between these two words; euphony and rhythm generally determine the choice between them on the part of a good writer. _Upon_ is preferred when motion into position is indicated, as in the sentence "Place the book _upon_ the table"; _on_ is preferred when merely rest or support is to be indicated, as in the sentence, "The book is _on_ the table. " 

####once 
**ONCE, ERST, FORMERLY.**  
_Once_, from Anglo-Saxon _an_, one, means literally at _one_ time, referring to a particular time in the past. _Erst_ is the superlative corresponding to the preposition and conjunction _ere_, Anglo-Saxon _œr_, before, and also means at a time before this. It is now used only in poetry or in poetic prose. _Formerly_ is from the comparative form answering to _erst._ It means before this time. It differs from _once_ in emphasizing not the one time in the past, but the relation of that time to the present. 

####one 
**ONE, SINGLE, ONLY.**  
_Unity_ is the common idea of all these terms; and at the same time the whole signification of _one_, which is opposed to none; _single_, in Latin _singulus_, each or one by itself, probably contracted from _sine angulo_, without an angle, because what is entirely by itself cannot form an angle, signifies that _one_ which is abstracted from others, and is particularly opposed to two, or a double which may form a pair; _only_, contracted from Anglo-Saxon _an-lic_, literally _onelike_, signifying in the form of unity, is employed for that of which there is no more. A person has _one_ child is a positive expression that bespeaks its own meaning: a person has a _single_ child conveys the idea that there ought to be or might be more, that more were expected, or that once there were more: a person has an _only_ child implies that he never had more.

####onward 
**ONWARD, FORWARD, PROGRESSIVE.**  
_Onward_ is taken in the literal sense of going nearer to an object: _forward_ is taken in the sense of going from an object, or going farther in the line before one: _progressive_, from _pro_, forward, and _gressus_, past participle of _grede_, itself from _gradus_, a step, has the sense of going gradually, or step by step, before one. A person goes _onward_ who does not stand still; he goes _forward_ who does not recede; he goes _progressively_ who goes _forward_ at certain intervals. _Onward_ is taken only in the proper acceptation of travelling; the traveller who has lost his way feels it necessary to go _onward_ with the hope of arriving at some point; _forward_ is employed in the improper as well as the proper application; a traveller goes _forward_ in order to reach his point of destination as quickly as possible; a learner uses his utmost endeavors in order to get _forward_ in his learning: _progressively_ is employed only in the improper application to what requires time and labor in order to bring it to a conclusion; every man goes on _progressively_ in his art, until he arrives at the point of perfection attainable by him.

####opaque 
**OPAQUE, DARK.**  
_Opaque_, in Latin _opacus_, corresponds in meaning to the native English _dark_ (Anglo-Saxon _deorc);_ the word _opaque_ is to _dark_ as the species to the genus, for it expresses that species of _darkness_ which is inherent in solid bodies, in distinction from those which emit light from themselves or admit of light into themselves; it is therefore employed scientifically for the more vulgar and familiar term _dark._ On this ground the earth is termed an _opaque_ body in distinction from the sun, moon, and other luminous bodies: any solid substance, as a tree or a stone, is an _opaque_ body, in distinction from glass, which is a clear or transparent body. 

####open

####opening 
**OPENING, APERTURE, CAVITY.**  
_Opening_ signifies in general any place left _open_ without defining any circumstances; the _aperture_ is generally a specific kind of _opening_ which is considered scientifically: there are _openings_ in a wood when the trees are partly cut away; _openings_ in streets by the removal of houses; or _openings_ in a fence that has been broken down; but anatomists speak of _apertures_ in the skull or in the heart, and the naturalist describes the _apertures_ in the nests of bees, ants, beavers, and the like; the _opening_ or _aperture_ is the commencement of an enclosure; the _cavity_ is the whole enclosure: hence they are frequently as a part to the whole: many animals make a _cavity_ in the earth for their nests, with only a small _aperture_ for their egress and ingress. 

####operate 
See [act](entry://act)

####opinionated 
**OPINIONATED, OPINIONATIVE, CONCEITED, EGOTISTICAL.**  
A fondness for one's opinion bespeaks the _opinionated_ man: a fond conceit of one's self bespeaks the _conceited_ man: a fond attachment to himself bespeaks the _egotistical_ man: a liking for one's self or one's own is evidently the common idea that runs through these terms; they differ in the mode and in the object.  
An _opinionated_ man is not only fond of his own _opinion_, but full of his own _opinion;_ he has an _opinion_ on everything, which is the best possible _opinion_, and is therefore delivered freely to every one, that they may profit in forming their own _opinions._ A _conceited_ man has a _conceit_ or a fond _opinion_ of his own talent; it is not only high in comparison with others, but it is so high as to be set above others. The _conceited_ man does not want to follow the ordinary means of acquiring knowledge: his _conceit_ suggests to him that his talent will supply labor, application, reading, and study, and every other contrivance which men have commonly employed for their improvement; he sees by intuition what another learns by experience and observation; he knows in a day what others want years to acquire; he learns of himself what others are contented to get by means of instruction. The _egotistical_ man makes himself the darling theme of his own contemplation; he admires and loves himself to that degree that he can talk and think of nothing else; his children, his house, his garden, his rooms, and the like, are the incessant theme of his conversation, and become invaluable from the mere circumstance of belonging to him. An _opinionated_ man is the most unfit for conversation, which affords pleasure only by an alternate and equable communication of sentiment. A _conceited_ man is the most unfit for co-operation, where a junction of talent and effort is essential to bring things to a conclusion; an _egotistical_ man is the most unfit to be a companion or friend, for he does not know how to value or like anything out of himself.  
**OPINION, SENTIMENT, NOTION.** — _Opinion_, in Latin from _opinor_, think or judge, is the work of the head. _Sentiment_, from _sentio_, feel, is the work of the heart. _Notion_, in Latin _notio_, from _nosco_, to know, is a simple operation of the thinking faculty.  
We form _opinions_, we have _sentiments:_ we get _notions. Opinions_ are formed on speculative matters; they are the result of reading, experience, and reflection: _sentiments_ are entertained on matters of practice; they are the consequence of habits and circumstances: _notions_ are gathered from sensible objects and arise out of the casualties of hearing and seeing. One forms _opinions_ on religion as respects its doctrines; one has _sentiments_ on religion as respects its practice and its precepts. The heathens formed _opinions_ respecting the immortality of the soul, but they amounted to nothing more than _opinions._ Christians entertain _sentiments_ of reverence toward God as their creator, and of dependence upon Him as their preserver.  
_Opinions_ are more liable to error than _sentiments._ The _opinion_ often springs from the imagination, and in all cases is but an inference or deduction which falls short of certain knowledge: _opinions_, therefore, as individual _opinions_, may be false; _sentiments_, on the other hand, depend upon the moral constitution or habits; they may, therefore, be good or bad, according to the character or temper of the person. _Notions_ are still more liable to error than either; they are the unmatured decisions of the uninformed mind on the appearances of things. The difference of _opinion_ among men on the most important questions of human life is a sufficient evidence that the mind of man is very easily led astray in matters of _opinion:_ whatever difference of _opinion_ there may be among Christians, there is but one _sentiment_ of love and good-will among those who follow the example of Christ rather than their own passions: the _notions_ of a Deity are so imperfect among savages in general that they seem to amount to little more than an indistinct idea of some superior invisible agent.

####opportune 
**OPPORTUNE, AUSPICIOUS, FAVORABLE, SEASONABLE, TIMELY.**  
_Opportune_, the adjective form of _opportunity_, from the Latin _opportunus_, signifies that which is fit or convenient, either as to a time, place, or occasion. _Auspicious_ is a term applied only to things, and such as are casual or only indicative of good, those having promise of success or happiness, that are propitious, the term being derived from _auspicium_, an augury from birds, from _avis_, a bird, and _specere_, to inspect, hence, omens of success.  
_Favorable_ implies a condition that is propitious, advantageous, friendly, one that is wholly acceptable, as a _favorable_ reply, a _favorable_ day or time; _seasonable_ (from Late Latin _satio_, a sowing, from _satus_, past participle of _serere,_ to sow, signifying the right time for sowing the seed), that which occurs or is done in a good or proper time, and so is specially welcome, that which belongs to a particular period of time, a benefit received in the time of need, in the nick of time; and _timely_, that which comes to pass at the right time, when most needed, when expected or promised. Differences between the terms _seasonable_ and _timely_ are critically considered in the article on TIMELY. 

####opportunity

####oppose 
**OPPOSE, RESIST, WITHSTAND, THWART.**  
The action of setting one thing up against another is obviously expressed by all these terms, but they differ in the manner and the circumstances. To _oppose_ (see [contradict](entry://contradict)) is the most general and unqualified term; it simply denotes the relative position of two objects, and when applied to persons it does not necessarily — imply any personal characteristic: we may _oppose_ reason or force to force; or things may be _opposed_ to each other which are in an _opposite_ direction, as a house to a church. _Resist_, signifying, literally, to stand back, away from, or against, is always an act of more or less force when applied to persons; it is mostly a culpable action, as when men _resist_ lawful authority; _resistance_ is, in fact, always bad, unless in case of actual self-defence. _Opposition_ may be made in any form, as when we _oppose_ a person's admittance into a house by our personal efforts: or _oppose_ his admission into a society by a declaration of our opinions. _Resistance_ is always a direct action, as when we _resist_ an invading army by the sword, or _resist_ the evidence of our senses by denying our assent; or, in relation to things, when wood or any hard substance _resists_ the violent efforts of steel or iron to make an impression.  
_With_ in _withstand_ has the force of against, _re_ in _resist_ the force of back, but _stand_ corresponds to _sist_, from Latin _sistere_, to stand. _Thwart_ is a Scandinavian word originally an adverb (compare _athwart_, meaning across), signifying across, in the contrary direction, and thence developing into a verb meaning to cross, to work against. These words are modes of _resistance_ applicable only to conscious agents. To _withstand_ is negative; it implies not to _yield_ to any foreign agency: thus, a person _withstands_ the entreaties of another to comply with a request. To _thwart_ is positive; it is actively to cross the will of another: thus humorsome people are perpetually _thwarting_ the wishes of those with whom they are in connection. It is a happy thing when a young man can _withstand_ the allurements of pleasure. It is a part of a Christian's duty to bear with patience the untoward events of life that _thwart_ his purposes.

####optimistic 
**OPTIMISTIC, CHEERFUL, SANGUINE.**  
All these terms mean in general hopeful, inclined to look on the bright side of things, but they differ in the suggested source of the hopefulness. _Optimistic_ expresses an intellectual attitude, _cheerful_ a moral attitude, and _sanguine_ a quality of temper having a physical basis. _Optimistic_ comes from Latin _optimus_, best, and means seeing the best in everything. For _cheerful_ see [cheer](entry://cheer). _Sanguine_, from Latin _sanguis_, blood, meant originally full blooded, and describes the attitude to life of the full-blooded people, of abounding animal spirits, who find easy what is hard for others, and are self-confident and bold, being conscious of their own capacity to face life and make the best of a situation. _Sanguine_, being founded on a physical condition, indicates a hopefulness that is really less enduring and stable than that indicated in _optimistic_ or _cheerful._

####option 
**OPTION, CHOICE.**  
_Option_ is immediately of Latin derivation (from _optare_, to wish), and is consequently a term of less frequent use than the word _choice_, for the derivation of which see [choose](entry://choose). The former term implies an uncontrolled act of the mind; the latter a simple leaning of the will. We speak of _option_ only as regards one's freedom from external constraint in the act of _choosing:_ one speaks of _choice_ only as the simple act itself. The _option_ or the power of _choosing_ is given; the _choice_ itself is made: hence we say a thing is at a person's _option,_ or it is his own _option_, or the _option_ is left to him, in order to designate his freedom of _choice_ more strongly than is expressed by the word _choice_ itself.

####oracular 
**ORACULAR, AUTHORITATIVE, DOGMATICAL, PROPHETIC.**  
_Oracular_, in Latin _oracularis_, from _oraculum_, an oracle, and that from _oro_, to speak, implied in its ancient sense that which related to an announcement from the gods in answer to some inquiry, a prophetic declaration, also to the places where such announcements were made, and to the deities making them. Such responses were closely allied to augury, but with this difference, that auguries could be taken anywhere, while the _oracular_ places were defined and limited. From the common belief that the responses or answers were given by or through the influence of a certain divine afflatus, the people came to look upon them as _authoritative_, as proceeding from a source that could not be questioned, and, consequently, placed implicit confidence in them.  
Now, in ordinary language, that is _authoritative_ which proceeds from a source that has the power to act, command, determine, and this source may be beneficial to all under its jurisdiction. _Authoritative_, therefore, has in general a good significance. _Dogmatical_, from Greek _δόγμα_ (English _dogma)_, an opinion, indicates an attempt to be _authoritative_ — to express opinions with a show and assumption of authority not recognized by others; it has in general a somewhat derogatory implication. These words are allied to _oracular_ through the common idea of expressing a judgment with a show of authority.  
_Prophetic_ implies an occurrence foretold, predicted, or presaged, and here again we revert to the ancient oracles, as their chief announcements were declarations of what was about to happen and what the inquirers should and should not do. The _prophets_ of Holy Writ were men divinely inspired, who frequently uttered predictions of coming events, both as warnings and encouragement to the people.

####order 
**ORDER, METHOD, RULE.**  
_Order_ (see **dispose** under [disposal](entry://disposal)) is applied in general to everything that is disposed; _method_, in French _méthode_, Latin _methodus_, Greek _μέθοδος_, from _μετά_ and _οδός_, or a way after, signifying the ready or right way to do a thing; and _rule_, from Latin _régula_, a rule, and _regere_, to govern, direct, or make straight (the former expressing the act of making a thing straight or that by which it is made so, the latter the abstract quality of being so), are applied only to that which is done; the _order_ lies in consulting the time, the place, and the object, so as to make them accord; the _method_ consists in the right choice of means to an end; the _rule_ consists in that which will keep us in the right way. Where there are a number of objects there must be _order_ in the disposition of them; where there is work to carry on, or any object to obtain, or any art to follow, there must be _method_ in the pursuit; a tradesman or merchant must have _method_ in keeping his accounts; a teacher must have a _method_ for the communication of instruction: the _rule_ is the part of the _method;_ it is that on which the _method_ rests; there cannot be _method_ without _rule_, but there may be _rule_ without _method;_ the _method_ varies with the thing that is to be done; the _rule_ is that which is permanent and serves as a guide under all circumstances. We adopt the _method_ and follow the _rule._ A painter adopts a certain _method_ of preparing his colors according to the _rules_ laid down by his art.  
_Order_ is said of every complicated machine, either of a physical or a moral kind: the _order_ of the universe, by which every part is made to harmonize with the other part, and all individually with the whole collectively, is that which constitutes its principal beauty: as rational beings, we aim at introducing the same _order_ into the moral scheme of society: _order_ is, therefore, that which is founded upon the nature of things, and seems in its extensive sense to comprehend all the rest. _Method_ is the work of the understanding, mostly as it is employed in the mechanical process; sometimes, however, as respects intellectual objects. _Rule_ is said either of mechanical and physical actions or moral conduct. The term _rule_ is, however, as before observed, employed distinctly from either _order_ or _method_, for it applies to the moral conduct of the individual. The Christian religion contains _rules_ for the guidance of our conduct in all the relations of human society.  
As epithets, _orderly, methodical_, and _regular_ are applied to persons and even to things according to the above distinction of the nouns: an _orderly_ man, or an _orderly_ society, is one who adheres to the established _order_ of things; the former in his domestic habits, the latter in their public capacity, their social meetings, and their social measures. A _methodical_ man is one who adopts _method_ in all he sets about; such a one may sometimes run into the extreme of formality, by being precise where precision is not necessary: we cannot speak of a _methodical_ society, for _method_ is altogether a personal quality. A man is _regular_, inasmuch as he follows a certain _rule_ in his moral actions, and thereby preserves a uniformity of conduct: a _regular_ society is one founded by a certain prescribed _rule._ So we say, an _orderly_ proceeding, or an _orderly_ course, for what is done in due _order:_ a _regular_ proceeding, or a _regular_ course, which goes on according to a prescribed _rule:_ a _methodical_ grammar, a _methodical_ delineation, and the like, for what is done according to a given _method._

####ordinance 
**ORDINANCE, DECREE, EDICT, LAW, RULE.**  
_Ordinance_, in Old French _ordenance_, from the Latin _ordo_, order, signifies a _rule_ of action, an observance commanded, a religious rite or ceremony, a canon of the church, an enactment by a legislative body. Specifically, the term means an orderly disposition or arrangement, hence, a rule, custom, rite, ceremony, or observance established by an authority having jurisdiction over whatever may be affected by its action. Sovereigns, high political bodies, and courts issue _decrees_, which are simply orders to produce specified results. The term _edict_ (from Latin e for _ex_, out, and _dictum_, participle of _dicere_, to speak, signifying a formal "speaking out, " to be heard by many people) is also applied to rules and laws promulgated in the same manner as a _decree_, but with this difference: a _decree_ (from Latin _de_, from, and _cretum_, past participle of _cernere_, to separate, meaning to separate truth from falsehood, good from bad, hence to judge) may be the award of an umpire, an arbitration, or a special authority designated to determine a question in controversy, and may be the subject of review by a higher authority, while an _edict_ is the proclamation of that which takes on the form and force of a law, a mandate, a command.  
A _law_ emanates from a regularly constituted authority, and has a power behind it to insure its respect and observance, as a law or act of the United States Congress can be sustained, if necessary, by the entire army and navy of the country. The relation of the term _law_ to other synonymous terms is discussed in the articles on LAWFUL and MAXIM. A _rule_ differs from the preceding terms in that it is a direction, a standard or guide; in law, an order by a court on a motion affecting parties to a suit, to regulate the practice of a court, or to establish a principle by a decision. This term is also further discussed in the article on ORDER.

####orient 
**ORIENT, EASTERN.**  
_Orient_ is the Latin term; _eastern_, the Anglo-Saxon word. The former comes from the present participle of the verb _oriri_, to rise, signifying the quarter where the sun rises. _Eastern_ also signifies the quarter where the sun rises; it may be allied to the stem of the Latin _aurora_, signifying the dawn. _Orient_ differs from _eastern_ in the poetic and imaginative connotations that it has acquired. _Eastern_ is the literal term, signifying from the east as a quarter of the heavens or of the earth. _Orient_ signifies characteristic of the east — suggesting either the light and splendor of the sunrise or the rich lands of the east, whence came pearls and gold and spice and gorgeous fabrics in the old 

####orifice 
**ORIFICE, PERFORATION.**  
_Orifice_, in Latin _orificium_ or _orifacium_, from _os_, mouth, and _facere_, to make, signifies a made mouth, that is, an opening made, as it were. _Perforation_, in Latin _perforatio_, from _per_, through, and _forare_, cognate with English _bore_, to pierce, signifies a piercing through.  
These terms are both scientifically employed to designate certain cavities in the human body; but the former signifies that which is natural, the latter that which is artificial: all the vessels of the human body have their _orifices_, which are so constructed as to open or close of themselves. Surgeons are frequently obliged to make _perforations_ into the bones: sometimes _perforation_ may describe what comes from a natural process, but it denotes a cavity made through a solid substance; but the _orifice_ is particularly applicable to such openings as most resemble the mouth in form and use. In this manner the words may be extended in their application to other bodies besides animal substances, and applied to other sciences besides anatomy: hence we speak of the _orifice_ of a tube, the _orifice_ of any flower, and the like; or the _perforation_ of a tree by means of a cannon-ball or an iron instrument. 

####origin 
**ORIGIN, ORIGINAL, BEGINNING, RISE, SOURCE.**  
_Origin_ and _original_ are both derived from the Latin _oriri_, to rise, the former designating the abstract property of _rising_, the latter the thing that is _risen;_ the first of its kind from which others _rise. Origin_ refers us to the cause as well as the period of beginning; _original_ is said of those things which give an _origin_ to another: the _origin_ serves to date the existence of a thing; the term _original_ serves to show the author of a thing, and is opposed to the copy. The _origin_ of the world is described in the first chapter of Genesis; Adam was the _original_ from whom all the human race has sprung.  
_Origin_ has regard to the cause, _beginning_ simply to the period, of existence: everything owes its existence to the _origin;_ it dates its existence from the _beginning;_ there cannot be an _origin_ without a _beginning;_ but there may be a _beginning_ where we do not speak of an _origin._ We look to the _origin_ of a thing in order to learn its nature: we look to the _beginning_ in order to learn its duration. When we have discovered the _origin_ of a quarrel, we are in a fair way of becoming acquainted with the aggressors; when we trace a quarrel to the _beginning_, we may easily ascertain how long it has lasted.  
_Origin_ and _rise_ are both employed for the primary state of existence, but the latter is a much more familiar term than the former: we speak of the _origin_ of an empire, the _origin_ of a family, the _origin_ of a dispute, and the like; but we say that a river takes its _rise_ from a certain mountain, that certain disorders take their _rise_ from particular circumstances which happen in early life: it is, moreover, observable that the term _origin_ is confined solely to the first commencement of a thing's existence; but _rise_ comprehends its gradual progress in the first stages of its existence; the _origin_ of the noblest families is in the first instance sometimes ignoble; the largest rivers take their _rise_ in small streams. We look to the _origin_ as to the cause of existence: we look to the _rise_ as to the situation in which the thing commences to exist, or the process by which it grows up into existence.  
The _origin_ and _rise_ are said of only one object; the _source_ is said of that which produces a succession of objects: the _origin_ of evil in general has given _rise_ to much idle speculation; the love of pleasure is the _source_ of incalculable mischief to individuals, as well as to society at large: the _origin_ exists but once; the _source_ is lasting: the _origin_ of every family is to be traced to our first parent, Adam; we have a never-failing _source_ of consolation in religion.

####ornate 
**ORNATE, ADORNED, DECORATED, EMBELLISHED.**  
For the distinction between _adorned, decorated_, and _embellished_ see the article on ADORN where the verbs of which these are participles are critically discussed. _Ornate_ differs from these words in intensity, and in not so distinctly suggesting the application of something external in order to beautify. That which is _ornate_ is very much _adorned, decorated_, or _embellished; ornate_ is, as it were in meaning, if not in form, the superlative of these words. Moreover, _ornate_ suggests gorgeousness and elaborateness inherent in the very design or material, not simply applied from without.

**OUT, ABROAD, BEYOND.**  
All of these terms signify external to something. _Out_, Anglo-Saxon _ut_, signifies external to something enclosed. We speak of being _out_ of the house, _out_ of the city; of taking valuables _out_ of a chest, etc. _Beyond_, from Anglo-Saxon _geond_, modem English _yond_, compounded with the prefix _be_, means external to some line or limit — on the other side of. _Abroad_, from Anglo-Saxon _a_ (on) and _brad_, broad, means in the whole breadth of the land. It means out in the open, and suggests not the definite bounds, but the freedom and space beyond the bounds.

**OUTLIVE, SURVIVE.**  
To _outlive_ is literally to live out the life of another, to live longer: to _survive_, in French _survivre_, Latin _super_, beyond, and _vivere_, to live, is to live beyond any given period; the former is employed to express the comparison between two lives; the latter to denote a protracted existence beyond any given term: one person is said properly to _outlive_ another who enjoys a longer life; but we speak of _surviving_ persons or things, in an indefinite or unqualified manner: it is not an unqualified blessing to _outlive_ all our nearest relatives and friends; no man can be happy in _surviving_ his honor.

####outward 
**OUTWARD, EXTERNAL, EXTERIOR.**  
_Outward_, or inclined to the _out_, after the manner of the _out_, indefinitely describes the situation; _external_, from the Latin _externus_ and _extra_, is more 1 definite in its sense, since it is employed only in regard to such objects as are conceived to be independent of man as a thinking being: hence, we may speak of the _outward_ part of a building, of a board, of a table, a box, and the like; but of _external_ objects acting on the mind, or of an _external_ agency. _Exterior_ is still more definite than either, as it expresses a higher degree of the _outward_ or _external_, the former being in the comparative and the latter two in the positive degree: when we speak of anything which has two coats, it is usual to designate the outermost by the name of the _exterior;_ when we speak simply of the surface, without reference to anything behind, it is denominated _external:_ as the _exterior_ coat of a walnut, or the _external_ surface of things. In the moral application, the _external_ or _outward_ is that which comes simply to the view; but the _exterior_ is that which is prominent and which consequently may conceal something: a man may sometimes neglect the _outside_ who is altogether mindful of the inward: a man with a pleasing _exterior_ will sometimes gain more friends than he who has more solid merit.

####overawe 
**OVERAWE, DAUNT, FRIGHTEN, INTIMIDATE.**  
_Overawe_, a compound of the English _over_ and the verb _awe_ (see [awe](entry://awe)), signifies, as a transitive, to restrain by fear or by superior influence. _Awe_, as a substantive, implies a fear that is reverential, or a feeling of emotion inspired by the contemplation of something sublime, and, as a transitive, to strike, inspire, or impress with feelings of reverential respect, or to hold one back or restrain him from some improper act by fear or respect. _Overawe_, in contradistinction, implies not only the usual quality of _awe_, but it assumes also the quality of a threat, an action that produces apprehension of something serious to come if something else is or is not done previously.  
To _daunt_ (see [dismay](entry://dismay)) a person is to check him in some proceeding by alarming him, to thwart, deter, or prevent him in a purpose, and. in an extreme sense, to appall, dismay, cow, and subdue him; to _frighten_ one is to affright, terrify, shock with sudden fear, and scare him; to _intimidate_ (from Latin _timeo_, I fear, _timidus_, fearful) one is to put him into a state of fear, and this term applies not only to an act that frightens a person, but to a series of actions that may affect him in his business and social relations, and on its application serves to _restrain_ or check him in his regular course.  
The last term has had a very frequent application of late to certain workmen who have been _intimidated_ from pursuing their regular occupation by others striving to force them to join in a labor strike or some disturbing labor proceeding, the importunities to do so usually being backed up by various threats in case of a refusal. Thus operators in an industrial plant may be _restrained_ from continuing at work by _intimidations_, threats, insinuations, and other acts that cause a fear of consequences, and by these acts are _overawed_ into doing what is demanded of them. 

####overbalance 
**OVERBALANCE, OUTWEIGH, PREPONDERATE.**  
To _overbalance_ is to throw the balance over on one side. To _outweigh_ is to exceed in weight. To _preponderate_, from _prœ_, before, and _pondus_, a weight, signifies also to exceed in weight. Although these terms approach so near to each other in their original meaning, yet they have now a different application: in the proper sense, a person _overbalances_ himself who loses his balance and goes on one side; a heavy body _outweighs_ one that is light when they are put into the same pair of scales. _Overbalance_ and _outweigh_ are likewise used in. the improper application; _preponderate_ is never used otherwise: things are said to _overbalance_ which are supposed to turn the scale to one side or the other; they are said to _outweigh_ when they are to be weighed against each other; they are said to _preponderate_ when one weighs down everything else: the evils which arise from innovations in society commonly _overbalance_ the good; the will of a parent should _outweigh_ every personal consideration in the mind, which will always be the case where the power of religion _preponderates._

####overbear 
**OVERBEAR, BEAR DOWN, OVERPOWER, OVERWHELM, SUBDUE.**  
To _overbear_ is to _bear_ one's self _over_ another, that is, to make another _bear_ one's weight; to _bear down_ is literally to bring down by _bearing_ upon; to _overpower_ is to get the _power_ over an object; to _overwhelm_, from _whelm_, a Scandinavian word signifying to overturn, to cover with water, meant literally to drown, to submerge entirely; to _subdue_ (see [conquer](entry://conquer)) is, literally, to lead underneath, in the elliptical sense of leading beneath a yoke. A man _overbears_ by carrying himself higher than others, and putting to silence those who might claim an equality with him; an _overbearing_ demeanor is most conspicuous in narrow circles, where an individual, from certain casual advantages, affects a superiority over the members of the same community. To _bear down_ is an act of greater violence: one _bears down_ opposition; it is properly the opposing force to force until one side yields, as when one party bears another down. _Overpower_, as the term implies, belongs to the exercise of power which may be either physical or moral: one may be _overpowered_ by another who in a struggle gets one into his power, or one may be _overpowered_ in an argument when the argument of one's antagonist is such as to bring one to silence. One is _overborne_ or _borne down_ by the exertion of individuals; _overpowered_ by the active efforts of individuals, or by the force of circumstances; _overwhelmed_ by circumstances or things only: _overborne_ by another of superior influence; _borne down_ by the force of his attack; _overpowered_ by numbers, by entreaties, by looks, and the like; and _overwhelmed_ by the torrent of words or the impetuosity of the attack.  
_Overpower_ and _overwhelm_ denote a partial superiority; _subdue_ denotes that which is permanent and positive: we may _overpower_ or _overwhelm_ for a time or to a certain degree; but to _subdue_ is to get an entire and lasting superiority. _Overpower_ and _overwhelm_ are said of what passes between persons nearly on an equality; but _subdue_ is said of those who are, or may be, reduced to a low state of inferiority: individuals or armies are _overpowered_ or _overwhelmed;_ individuals or nations are _subdued._ In the moral or extended application, _overbear_ and _bear down_ both imply force or violence, but the latter even more than the former: one passion may be said to _overbear_ another, or to _overbear_ reason. Whatever _bears down_ carries all before it.  
To _overbear, overwhelm_, and _subdue_ are likewise applied to the moral feelings, as well as to the external relations of things; but the former two are the effects of external circumstances; the latter follows from the exercise of the reasoning powers: the tender feelings are _overpowered;_ the mind is _overwhelmed_ with painful feelings; the unruly passions are _subdued_ by the force of religious contemplation: a person may be so _overpowered_ on seeing a dying friend as to be unable to speak; a person may be so _overwhelmed_ with grief, upon the death of a near and dear relative, as to be unable to attend to his customary duties; the passion of anger has been so completely _subdued_ by the influence of religion on the heart that instances have been known of the most irascible tempers being converted into the most mild and forbearing.

####overflow 
**OVERFLOW, INUNDATE, DELUGE.**  
What _overflows_ simply _flows over;_ what _inundates_ (from _in_ and _unda_, a wave) _flows_ into; what _deluges_ (through French from _de_, for _dis_, apart, away, and _luere_, to wash) washes away.  
The term _overflow_ bespeaks abundance; whatever exceeds the measure of contents must _flow over_, because it is more than can be held: to _inundate_ bespeaks not only abundance, but vehemence; when it _inundates_ it _flows_ in faster than is desired, it fills to an inconvenient height: to _deluge_ bespeaks impetuosity; a _deluge_ irresistibly carries away all before it. This explanation of these terms in their proper sense will illustrate their improper application: the heart is said to _overflow_ with joy, with grief, with bitterness, and the like, in order to denote the superabundance of the thing; a country is said to be _inundated_ by swarms of inhabitants when speaking of numbers who intrude themselves to the annoyance of the natives; the town is said to be _deluged_ with publications of different kinds when they appear in such profusion and in such quick succession as to supersede others of more value.

**OVERRULE, SUPERSEDE.**  
To _overrule_ is, literally, to get the superiority of rule; and to _supersede_ (from _super_ and _sedere)_, is to get the upper or superior seat; but the former is employed only as the act of persons; the latter is applied to things as the agents: a man may be _overruled_ in his domestic government, or he may be _overruled_ in a public assembly, or he may be _overruled_ in the cabinet; large works in general _supersede_ the necessity of smaller ones, by containing that which is superior both in quantity and quality.

####overspread 
**OVERSPREAD, OVERRUN, RAVAGE.**  
To _overspread_ signifies simply to cover the whole surface of a body; but to _overrun_ is a mode of spreading, namely, by running; things in general, therefore, are said to _overspread_ which admit of extension; nothing can be said to _overrun_ but what literally or figuratively runs: the face is _overspread_ with spots; the ground is _overrun_ with weeds. To _overrun_ and to _ravage_ (based on French _ravir_, Late Latin _rapire_, for _rapere)_ are both employed to imply the active and extended destruction of an enemy; but the former expresses more than the latter: a small body may _ravage_ in particular parts; but immense numbers are said to _overrun_, as they run into every part; the Barbarians _overran_ all Europe and settled in different countries; detachments are sent out to _ravage_ the country or neighborhood. 

####overthrow 
See [beat](entry://beat); [overturn](entry://overturn)

####overturn 
**OVERTURN, OVERTHROW, SUBVERT, INVERT, REVERSE.**  
To _overturn_ is simply to turn over, an act which may be more or less gradual; but to _overthrow_ is to throw over, which will be more or less violent. To _overturn_ is to turn a thing either with its side or its bottom upward; but to _subvert_ is to turn that under which should be upward: to _reverse_ is to turn that before which should be behind; and to _invert_ is to place that on its head which should rest on its feet. These terms differ accordingly in their application and circumstances: things are _overturned_ by contrivance and gradual means; infidels attempt to _overturn_ Christianity by means of ridicule and falsehood: governments are _overthrown_ by violence. To _overturn_ is said of small matters; to _subvert_ only of national or large concerns: domestic economy may be _overturned;_ religious or political establishments may be _subverted:_ that may be _overturned_ which is simply set up; that is _subverted_ which has been established: an assertion may be _overturned;_ the best sanctioned principles may by artifice be _subverted._  
To _overturn, overthrow_, and _subvert_ generally involve the destruction of the thing so _overturned, overthrown_, or _subverted_, or at least render it for the time useless, and are, therefore, mostly unallowed acts; but _reverse_ and _invert_, which have a more particular application, have a less specific character of propriety: we may _reverse_ a proposition by taking the negative instead of the affirmative; a decree may be _reversed_ so as to render it nugatory; but both of these acts may be right or wrong, according to circumstances: likewise, the order of particular things may be _inverted_ to suit the convenience of parties; but the order of society cannot be _inverted_ without _subverting_ all the principles on which civil society is built.

####overwhelm 
**OVERWHELM, CRUSH.**  
To _overwhelm_ (see also under OVERBEAR) is to cover with a heavy body, so that one should sink under it: to _crush_ (see [break](entry://break)) is to destroy the consistency of a thing by violent pressure: a thing may be _crushed_ by being _overwhelmed_, but it may be _overwhelmed_ without being _crushed;_ and it may be _crushed_ without being _overwhelmed:_ the girl Tarpeia, who betrayed the Capitoline Hill to the Sabines, is said to have been _overwhelmed_ with their arms, by which she was _crushed_ to death: when many persons fall on one he may be _overwhelmed_, but not necessarily _crushed:_ when a wagon goes over a body, it may be _crushed_, but not _overwhelmed._

####pace 
**PACE, STEP.**  
_Pace_, derived from Latin _passus_, step, is the Latin term corresponding to the native English _step_ (from Anglo-Saxon _steppan)_, signifying a stretch of the legs.  
As regards the act, the _pace_ expresses the general manner of passing on or moving the body; the _step_ implies the manner of setting or extending the foot: the _pace_ is distinguished by being either a walk or a run, and in regard to horses a trot or a gallop: the _step_ is distinguished by being long or short, to the right or left, forward or backward. The same _pace_ may be modified so as to be more or less easy, more or less quick; the _step_ may vary as it is light or heavy, graceful or ungraceful, long or short: we may go a slow _pace_ with long _steps_, or we may go a quick _pace_ with short _steps:_ a slow _pace_ is best suited to the solemnity of a funeral; a long _step_ must be taken by soldiers in a slow march.  
As regards the space passed or _stepped_ over, the _pace_ is a measured distance, formed by a long _step;_ the _step_, on the other hand, is indefinitely employed for any space _stepped_ over, but particularly that ordinary space which one _steps_ over without an effort: a thousand _paces_ was the Roman measurement for a mile; a _step_ or two designates almost the shortest possible distance. 

####pacifist 
**PACIFIST, CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR, SLACKER.**  
These are words which the European war brought into special prominence in England and America. _Pacifist_ and _conscientious objector_ signify one who does not believe in war, but _pacifist_ puts the attitude in positive terms, _conscientious objector_ in negative terms. A _pacifist_ is one who believes in the establishment of world peace with some provision for an international court of arbitration, a league of nations to support the decrees of such a court, etc. _Conscientious objector_ was coined to describe those persons who, without having any theory concerning the establishment of a _pacific_ world, believe that war is morally wrong for them and refuse to fight. It referred primarily to members of such religious sects as the Quakers. The two terms are practically interchangeable. _Conscientious objector_, being the more inclusive term, now seems to be gaining ground. _Slacker_ is a slang term describing a man who refuses to do his share of the fighting, who is _slack_ in his duty. It is a term of contempt often applied by others to those who would call themselves _conscientious objectors or pacifists._

####pain 
**PAIN, PANG, AGONY, ANGUISH.**  
_Pain_ is connected with the Latin _pœna_, a penalty. _Pang_ is a word of uncertain origin. _Agony_ comes from the Greek _αγωνία_, a contest, signifying the labor or _pain_ of a struggle. _Anguish_, from the Latin _angere_, to choke (whence _anger_ and _anxiety_ are also derived), signifies the _pain_ arising from choking.  
_Pain_, which expresses the feeling that is most repugnant to the nature of all sensible beings, is here the generic, and the rest specific, terms: _pain_ and _agony_ are applied indiscriminately to what is physical and mental; _pang_ and _anguish_ mostly signify that which is mental: _pain_ signifies either an individual feeling or a permanent state; _pang_ is only a particular feeling: _agony_ is sometimes employed for the individual feeling, but more commonly for the state; _anguish_ is always employed for the state. _Pain_ is indefinite with regard to the degree; it may rise to the highest or sink to the lowest possible degree; the rest are positively high degrees of _pain:_ the _pang_ is a sharp _pain;_ the _agony_ is a severe and permanent _pain;_ the _anguish_ is an overwhelming _pain._

####paint 
**PAINT, DEPICT.**  
_Paint_ and _depict_ both come from the Latin _pingere_, to represent forms and figures: as a verb, to _paint_ is employed either literally to represent figures on paper or to represent circumstances and events by means of words; to _depict_ is used only in this latter sense, but the former word expresses a greater exercise of the imagination than the latter: it is the art of the poet to _paint_ nature in lively colors; it is the art of the historian or narrator to _depict_ a real scene of misery in strong colors.  
As nouns, _painting_ describes rather the action or operation, and _picture_ the result. When we speak of a good _painting_, we think particularly of its execution as to drapery, disposition of colors, and the like; but when we speak of a fine _picture_, we refer immediately to the object represented, and the impression which it is capable of producing on the beholder: _paintings_ are confined either to _oil-paintings_ or _paintings_ in colors: but every drawing, whether in pencil, in crayon, or in India ink, may produce a _picture;_ and we have likewise _pictures_ in embroidery, _pictures_ in tapestry, and _pictures_ in mosaic.  
_Painting_ is employed only in the proper sense; _picture_ is often used figuratively: old _paintings_ derive a value from the master by whom they were executed; a well-regulated family, bound together by the ties of affection, presents the truest _picture_ of human happiness.

####palate 
**PALATE, TASTE.**  
_Palate_, in Latin _Taste, palatum_, signifies the roof of the mouth. Middle English _tasten_, Old French _taster_, from a Late Latin _taxi-tare_ (ultimately from Latin _tangere_, to touch), meant originally to touch, especially to touch lightly, then to touch lightly with the tongue.  
_Palate_ is, in an improper sense, employed for _taste_, because it shares with the tongue the sense of _taste_, but _taste_ is never employed for _palate:_ a person is said to have a nice _palate_ when he is nice in what he eats or drinks; but his _taste_ extends to all matters of sense, as well as those which are intellectual. A man of _taste_, or of a nice _taste_, conveys much more as a characteristic than a man of a nice _palate:_ the former is said only in a good sense, but the latter is particularly applicable to the epicure. 

####pale 
**PALE, PALLID, WAN.**  
_Pale_, in French _pâle_, and _pallid_, in Latin _pallidus_, both come from _pallere_, to turn pale. _Wan is_ in Anglo-Saxon _wann_, signifying dark, black, colorless.  
_Pallid_ rises upon _pale_, and _wan_ upon _pallid:_ the absence of color in any degree, where color is a requisite quality, constitutes _paleness;_ but _pallidness_ is an excess of _paleness_, and _wan_ is an unusual degree of _pallidness: paleness_ in the countenance may be temporary; but _pallidness_ and _wanness_ are permanent; fear or any sudden emotion may produce _paleness;_ but protracted sickness, hunger, and fatigue bring on _pallidness;_ and when these calamities are combined and heightened by every aggravation, they may produce that which is specifically termed _wanness._

####palpitate 
**PALPITATE, FLUTTER, PANT, GASP.**  
_Palpitate_ is a frequentative of Latin _pal-pare_, to move quickly and frequently. _Flutter_, from Anglo-Saxon _floterian_, to _float_ about, meant to drift back and forth, but it now signifies to fly backward and forward in an agitated manner. _Pant_ comes through Old French _pantaisier_, to breathe with difficulty, from popular Latin _phantasiare_, to be oppressed with the nightmare, from Greek _φαντασία_, a vision, whence _fantasy_ and _fancy_ are derived. _Gasp_ is in Middle English _gaspen_, but its further origin is not clear.  
These terms agree in a particular manner, as they signify the irregular action of the heart or lungs: the former two are said of the heart, and the latter two of the lungs or breath; to _palpitate_ expresses that which is strong; it is a strong beating of the blood against the vessels of the heart: to _flutter_ expresses that which is rapid; it is a violent and alternate motion of the blood backward and forward: fear and suspense produce commonly _palpitation_, but joy and hope produce a _fluttering; panting_ is, with regard to the breath, what _palpitating_ is with regard to the heart; _panting_ is occasioned by the inflated state of the respiratory organs, which renders this _palpitating_ necessary: _gasping_ differs from the former, inasmuch as it denotes a direct stoppage of the breath, a cessation of action in the respiratory organs.

####parable 
**PARABLE, ALLEGORY.**  
Both these terms imply a veiled mode of speech, which serves more or less to conceal the main object of the discourse by presenting it under the appearance of something else, which accords with it in most of the particulars: the _parable_, in French _parabole_, Greek _παραβολή_, from _παρά_, beside, and _βάλλειν_, to cast, signifying a placing beside or a comparison of something with something else; the _allegory_ (see [figure](entry://figure)) in describing historical events. The _parable_ substitutes some other subject or agent, who is represented under a character that is suitable to the one referred to. In the _allegory axe_ introduced strange and arbitrary persons in the place of the real personages, or imaginary characteristics and circumstances are ascribed to real persons. The _parable_ is principally employed in the sacred writings; the _allegory_ forms a grand feature in the productions of the eastern nations.

####part 
**PART, DIVISION, PORTION, SHARE.**  
_Part_, in Latin _pars_, a division, is a term not only of more general use, but of more comprehensive meaning than _division_ (see [divide](entry://divide)); it is always employed for the thing _divided_, but _division_ may be employed either for the act of _dividing_ or the thing that is _divided:_ but in all cases the word _division_ has always a reference to some action and the agent by whom it has been performed; whereas _part_, which is perfectly abstract, has altogether lost this idea. We always speak of the _part_ as opposed to the whole, but of the _division_ as it has been made of the whole. A _part_ is formed of itself by accident or made by design; a _division_ is always the effect of design: a _part_ is indefinite as to its quantity or nature; it may be large or small, round or square, of any dimension, form, size, or character; but a _division_ is always regulated by some certain principles; it depends upon the circumstances of the _divider_ and the thing to be _divided._ A page a line, or a word is a _part_ of any book; but the books, chapters, sections, and paragraphs are the _divisions_ of the book. Stones, wood, water, air, and the like are _parts_ of the world; fire, air, earth, and water are physical _divisions_ of the globe; continents, seas, rivers, mountains, and the like are geographical _divisions_, under which are likewise included its political _divisions_ into countries, kingdoms, etc.  
A _part_ may be detached from the whole; a _division_ is always conceived of in connection with the whole; _portion_, from Latin _portio_, connected with _pars_, a part, and _share_ (from Anglo-Saxon _scearu_, a fragment, based on _sceran_, German _scheren_, to sheer, allied with Old Irish _scaraim_, I separate) are particular species of _divisions_ which are said of such matters as are assignable to individuals; _portion_ refers to individuals without any distinction; _share_ to individuals specially referred to. The _portion_ of happiness which falls to every man's lot is more equal than is generally supposed; the _share_ which partners have in the profits of any undertaking depends upon the sum which each has contributed toward its completion. The _portion_ is that which simply comes to any one; but the _share_ is that which belongs to one by a certain right. According to the ancient customs of Normandy, the daughters could have no more than a third _part_ of the property for their _share_, which was _divided_ into equal _portions_ between them.  
See also [segregate](entry://segregate)  
**PART, PIECE, PATCH.** — _Part_ in its strict sense is taken in connection with the whole; _piece_, in French _pièce_, may be ultimately of Celtic origin. _Patch_, Middle English _pacche_, of uncertain origin, is that _piece_ which is distinguished from others.  
Things may be divided into _parts_ without any express separation; but when divided into _pieces_ they are actually cut asunder. Hence we may speak of a loaf as divided into twelve _parts_ when it is only conceived to be so; and divided into twelve _pieces_ when it is really so. On this ground we talk of the _parts_ of a country, but not of the _pieces;_ and of a _piece_ of land, not a _part_ of land; so, likewise, letters are said to be the component _parts_ of a word, but the half or the quarter of any given letter is called a _piece._ The chapters, the pages, the lines, etc., are the various _parts_ of a book; certain passages or quantities drawn from the book are called _pieces:_ the _parts_ of matter may be infinitely decomposed; various bodies may be formed out of so ductile a _piece_ of matter as clay. The _piece_ is that which may sometimes serve as a whole; but the _patch_ is that which is always broken and disjointed, a something imperfect: many things may be formed out of a _piece;_ but the _patch_ serves only to fill up a chasm.  
**PARTAKE, PARTICIPATE, SHARE.** — _Partake_ and _participate_, the one English, the other from Latin _participare_, based on an extended form of _pars_, and _capere_, or, to take a part, signify, literally, to take a part in a thing, and may bo applied either in the sense of having a part in more than one object at the same time or having a part with others in the same object. In the first sense _partake_ is the more familiar and ordinary expression, as a body may be said to _partake_ of the essence of a salt and an acid. _Participate_ is also used in the same sense, sometimes in poetry.  
In the sense of having a part with others in the same object, to _partake_ is a selfish action, to _participate_ is either a selfish or benevolent action; we _partake_ of that which pleases ourselves, we _participate_ in that which pleases others, or in their pleasures.  
To _partake_ is the act of taking or getting a thing to one's self; to _share_ is the act of having a title to a _share,_ or being in the habit of receiving a _share:_ we may, therefore, _partake_ of a thing without _sharing_ it, and _share it_ without _partaking._ We _partake_ of things mostly through the medium of the senses: whatever, therefore, we take a _part_ in, whether gratuitously or casually, of that we may be said to _partake;_ in this manner we _partake_ of an entertainment without _sharing_ it: on the other hand, we _share_ things that promise to be of advantage or profit, and what we _share_ is what we claim; in this manner we _share_ a sum of money which has been left to us in. common with others. 

####particular 
**PARTICULAR, SINGULAR, ODD, ECCENTRIC, STRANGE.**  
_Particular_, in French _particulier_, Latin _particularis_, from _particula_, a particle, signifies belonging to a particle or a very small part. _Singular_, in French _singulier_, Latin _singularis_, from _singulus_, every one, signifies, literally, unmatched (see [odd](entry://odd)). _Eccentric_, through Late Latin from Greek _έκ_ out, and _κέντρον_, centre, signifies out of the centre or direct line. _Strange_, in Old French _estrange_, Latin _extraneus_, from Greek _έξ_, out of, and a suffix, signifies out of some other part, or not belonging to this part.  
All these terms are employed either as characteristics of persons or things. What is _particular_ belongs to some small _particle_ or point to which it is confined; what is _singular_ is _single_, or the only one of its kind; what is _odd_ is without an equal or anything with which it is fit to pair; what is _eccentric_ is not to be brought within any rule or estimate, it deviates to the right and the left; what is _strange_ is different from that which one is accustomed to see, it does not admit of comparison or assimilation. A person is _particular_ as regards himself; he is _singular_ as regards others; he is _particular_ in his habits or modes of action; he is _singular_ in that which is about him; we may be _particular_ or _singular_ in our dress; in the former case we study the minute points of our dress to please ourselves; in the latter case we adopt a mode of dress that distinguishes us from all others.  
One is _odd, eccentric_, and _strange_, more as it regards established modes, forms, and rules, than individual circumstances: a person is _odd_ when his actions or his words bear no resemblance to those of others; he is _eccentric_ if he irregularly departs from the customary modes of proceeding; he is _strange_ when that which he does makes him new or unknown to those who are about him. _Particularity_ and _singularity_ are not always taken in a bad sense; _oddness, eccentricity_, and _strangeness_ are never taken in a good one. A person ought to be _particular_ in the choice of his society, his amusements, his books, and the like; he ought to be _singular_ in virtue, when vice is unfortunately prevalent: but _particularity_ becomes ridiculous when it concerns trifles; and _singularity_ becomes culpable when it is not warranted by the most imperious necessity. As _oddness, eccentricity_, and _strangeness_ consist in the violation of good order, of the decencies of human life, or the more important points of moral duty, they can never be justifiable and are often unpardonable. An _odd_ man with whom no one can associate, and who likes to associate with no one, is an outcast by nature. An _eccentric_ character, who distinguishes himself by the frequent breach of established rule, is a being who is bound to incur the hostility of the world. A _strange_ person, who makes himself a _stranger_ among those to whom he is bound by the closest ties, is a being as unfortunate as he is misunderstood.  
When applied to characterize inanimate objects, these words are mostly used in an indifferent, but sometimes in a bad, sense: the term _particular_ serves to define or specify, it is opposed to the general or indefinite; a _particular_ day or hour, a _particular_ case, a _particular_ person, are expressions which confine one's attention to one precise object in distinction from the rest; _singular_, like the word _particular_, marks but one object, and that which is clearly pointed out in distinction from the rest; but this term differs from the former, inasmuch as the _particular_ is said only of that which one has arbitrarily made _particular;_ but the _singular_ is so from its own properties: thus a place is _particular_ when we fix upon it and mark it out in any manner so that it may be known from others; a place is _singular_ if it have anything in itself which distinguishes it from others. _Odd_, in an indifferent sense, is opposed to even, and applied to objects in general; an _odd_ number, an _odd_ person, an _odd_ book, and the like: but it is also employed in a bad sense to mark objects which are totally dissimilar to others; thus an _odd_ idea, an _odd_ conceit, an _odd_ whim, an _odd_ way, an _odd_ place. _Eccentric_ is applied in its proper sense to mathematical lines or circles which have not the same centre, and is never employed in an improper sense: _strange_, in its proper sense, marks that which is unknown or unusual, as a _strange_ face, a _strange_ figure, a _strange_ place; but in the moral application it is like the word _odd_, and conveys the unfavorable idea of that which is uncommon and not worth knowing; a _strange_ noise designates not only that which has not been heard before, but that which it is not desirable to hear; a _strange_ place may signify not only that which we have been unaccustomed to sec, but that which has also much in it that is objectionable.  
**PARTICULAR, INDIVIDUAL.** — _Particular_ (see [peculiar](entry://peculiar)). _Individual_, in French _individuel_, Latin _individuus_, with a suffix, signifies that which cannot be divided.  
Both these terms are employed to express one object; but _particular_ is much more specific than _individual;_ the _particular_ confines us to one object only of many; but _individual_ may be said of any one object among many. A _particular_ object cannot be misunderstood for any other while it remains _particular;_ but the _individual_ object can never be known from other _individual_ objects while it remains only _individual. Particular_ is a term used in regard to _individuals_, and is opposed to the general: _individual_ is a term used in regard to collectives, and is opposed to the whole or that which is divisible into parts.

####pass 
**PASS, PASSPORT, SAFE-CONDUCT, SAFEGUARD.**  
_Pass_, in French _passer_, from Late Latin _passare_, from _passus_, a step, Spanish _pasar_, Italian _passare_, all virtually mean to step, to go; permission to go or come, evidenced by a ticket or other document issued by a competent authority.  
A _passport_ is a warrant of protection issued by a government to one of its citizens to enable the bearer to visit or travel in another country without molestation. An _emergency passport_ may be issued to a citizen of the United States happening to be in a foreign country, under specific circumstances, by certain representatives of the United States in that country.  
A _safe-conduct_ may be an official warrant issued as above, or a convoy or guard to protect the bearer in or passing through a hostile or a foreign country. To _safeguard_ a person, a ship, or an important interest is to provide the subject with ample protection in any of the above forms.  
In the second year of the European war (1915) it was discovered that many _passports_ issued by the United States government had been forged and had got into the hands of spies of the Teutonic powers. This led the government to adopt more rigorous regulations for the issue of such documents.

####patience 
**PATIENCE, ENDURANCE, RESIGNATION.**  
_Patience_ applies to any troubles or pains whatever, small or great; _resignation_ is employed only for those of great moment, in which our dearest interests are concerned: _patience_, when compared with _resignation_, is somewhat negative; it consists in the abstaining from all complaint or indication of what one suffers: but _resignation_ consists in a positive sentiment of conformity to the existing circumstances, be they what they may. There are perpetual occurrences which are apt to harass the temper, unless one regards them with _patience;_ the misfortunes of some men are of so calamitous a nature that if they have not acquired _resignation_ they must inevitably sink under them. _Patience_ applies only to the evils that actually hang over us; but there is a _resignation_ connected with a firm trust in Providence which extends its views to futurity and prepares us for the worst that may happen.  
As _patience_ lies in the manner and temper of suffering, and _endurance_ in the act, we may have _endurance_ and not _patience:_ for we may have much to _endure_, and consequently _endurance:_ but if we do not _endure_ it with an easy mind and without the disturbance of our looks and words, we have not _patience:_ on the other hand, we may have _patience_, but not _endurance:_ for our _patience_ may be exercised by momentary trifles which are not sufficiently great or lasting to constitute _endurance._  
**PATIENT, PASSIVE, SUBMISSIVE.** — _Patient_, from the Latin _patiens_, signifies, literally, suffering, and is applied to things in general, but especially to what is painful. _Passive_, from the Latin _passivus_ and _passus_, signifying, literally, suffered or acted upon, applies to those matters in which persons have to act; he is _patient_ who bears what he has to suffer without any expressions of complaint; he is passive who abstains altogether from acting when he might act.  
_Patience_ is a virtue springing from principle; _passiveness_ is always involuntary, and may be supposed to arise from want of spirit.  
_Patience_ is therefore applicable to conscious agents only; _passiveness_ is applicable to inanimate objects which do not act at all, or at least not adversely.  
_Passive_ and _submissive_ both refer to the will of others; but _passive_ signifies simply not resisting; _submissive_ signifies positively conforming to the will of another.

####peace 
**PEACE, QUIET, CALM, TRANQUILLITY.**  
_Peace_ is derived through French from Latin _pax. Quiet_ (see **easy** under [ease](entry://ease)). _Calm_ (see [abate](entry://abate); [calm](entry://calm)). _Tranquillity_ is in Latin _tranquillitas_, from _tranquillus_, at rest.  
_Peace_ is a term of more general application and more comprehensive meaning than the others; it applies either to communities or individuals; but _quiet_ applies only to individuals or small communities. Nations are said to have _peace_, but not _quiet;_ persons or families may have both _peace_ and _quiet. Peace_ implies an exemption from public or private broils; _quiet_ implies a freedom from noise or interruption. Every well-disposed family strives to be at _peace_ with its neighbors, and every affectionate family will naturally act in such a manner as to promote _peace_ among all its members: the _quiet_ of a neighborhood is one of its first recommendations as a place of residence.  
_Peace_ and _quiet_, in regard to individuals, have likewise a reference to the internal state of the mind; but the former expresses the permanent condition of the mind, the latter its transitory condition. Serious matters only can disturb our _peace;_ trivial matters may disturb our _quiet:_ a good man enjoys the _peace_ of a good conscience; but he may have unavoidable cares and anxieties which disturb his _quiet._ There can be no _peace_ where a man's passions are perpetually engaged in a conflict with one another; there can be no _quiet_ where a man is embarrassed in his pecuniary affairs.  
_Calm_ is a species of _quiet_, which affects objects in the natural or the moral world; it indicates the absence of violent motion as well as violent noise; it is that state which more immediately succeeds a state of agitation. As storms at sea are frequently preceded as well as succeeded by a dead _calm_, so political storms have likewise their _calms_, which are their attendants, if not their precursors. _Tranquillity_, on the other hand, is taken more absolutely: it expresses the situation as it exists at the present moment, independently of what goes before or after; it is sometimes applicable to society, sometimes to natural objects, and sometimes to the mind. The _tranquillity_ of the state cannot be preserved unless the authority of the magistrates be upheld; the _tranquillity_ of the air and of all the surrounding objects is one thing which gives the country its peculiar charms; the _tranquillity_ of the mind in the season of devotion contributes essentially to produce a suitable degree of religious fervor.  
As epithets, these terms bear the same relation to each other: people are _peaceable_ as they are disposed to promote _peace_ in society at large, or in their private relations; they are _quiet_ inasmuch as they abstain from every loud expression, or are exempt from any commotion in themselves; they are _calm_, inasmuch as they are exempt from the commotion which at any given moment rages around them; they are _tranquil_, inasmuch as they enjoy an entire exemption from everything which can discompose. A town is _peaceable_ as respects the disposition of the inhabitants; it is _quiet_ as respects its external circumstances of freedom from bustle and noise: an evening is _calm_ when the air is lulled into a particular stillness which is not interrupted by any loud sounds: a scene is _tranquil_ which combines everything calculated to soothe the spirits to rest.  
**PEACEABLE, PEACEFUL, PACIFIC.** — _Peaceable_ is used in the proper sense of the word _peace_, as it expresses an exemption from strife or contest; but _peaceful_ is used in its improper sense, as it expresses an exemption from agitation or commotion. Persons or things are _peaceable;_ things, particularly in the higher style, are _peaceful:_ a family is designated as _peaceable_ in regard to its inhabitants; a house is designated as a _peaceful_ abode as it is remote from the bustle and hurry of a multitude. _Pacific_ signifies either making _peace_ or disposed to make _peace_, and is applied mostly to what we do to others. We are _peaceable_ when we do not engage in quarrels of our own; we are _pacific_ if we wish to keep _peace_ or make _peace_ between others. Hence the term _peaceable_ is mostly employed for individual or private concerns, and _pacific_ most properly for national concerns: subjects ought to be _peaceable_, and monarchs _pacific._

####peculiar 
**PECULIAR, APPROPRIATE, PARTICULAR.**  
_Peculiar_, in Latin _peculiaris_, from _peculium_, private property, _pecunia_, money, and _pecus_, cattle, in which property consisted, is said of that which belongs to persons or things; _appropriate_, signifying belonging, fitting (see [ascribe](entry://ascribe)), is said of that which belongs to things only: the faculty of speech is _peculiar_ to man, in distinction from all other animals; an address may be _appropriate_ to the circumstances of the individual. _Peculiar_ and _particular_ (see [particular](entry://particular)) arc both employed to distinguish objects; but the former distinguishes the object by showing its connection with others; _particular_ distinguishes it by a reference to some acknowledged circumstance; hence we may say that a person enjoys _peculiar_ privileges or _particular_ privileges: in this case _peculiar_ signifies such as are confined to him and enjoyed by none else; _particular_ signifier: such as are distinguished in degree and quality from others of the kind.

####peel 
**PEEL, PARE.**  
_Peel_, from the French _peter_, derived from Latin _petits_, a skin, is the same as to skin or to take off the skin: to _pare_, from the Latin _parare_, to trim or make in order, signifies to smooth. The former of these terms denotes a natural, the latter an artificial, process: the former excludes the idea of a forcible separation; the latter includes the idea of separation by means of a knife or sharp instrument: potatoes and apples are _peeled_ after they are boiled; they are _pared_ before they are boiled; an orange and a walnut are always _peeled_ but not _pared;_ a cucumber must be _pared_ and not _peeled:_ in like manner, the skin may sometimes be _peeled_ from the flesh, and the nails are _pared._

####pellucid 
**PELLUCID, TRANSPARENT.**  
_Pellucid_, in Latin _pellucidus_, is compounded of _per_, through, and _lucidus_, shining. _Transparent_, in Latin _transparens_, from _trans_, through or beyond, and_ parere_, to appear, signifies that which admits light through it. _Pellucid_ is said of that which is pervious to the light or of that into which the eye can penetrate; _transparent_ is said of that which is throughout bright: a stream is _pellucid;_ it admits of the light so as to reflect objects, but it is not _transparent_ for the eye.

####penetrate 
**PENETRATE, PIERCE, PERFORATE, BORE.**  
To _penetrate_ (see [discernment](entry://discernment)) is simply to make an entrance into any substance; to _pierce_ is commonly assumed to come through Old French _pertuisier_, from Latin _per_, through, and _tundere_, to beat. _Perforate_ comes from the Latin _per_, through, and _forare_, to pierce, which is the same word as the native English bore. To _penetrate_ is a natural and gradual process; in this manner rust _penetrates_ iron, water _penetrates_ wood; to _pierce_ is a violent, and commonly artificial, process; thus an arrow or a bullet _pierces_ through wood. The instrument by which the act of _penetration_ is performed is in no case defined; but that of _piercing_ commonly proceeds by some pointed instrument: we may _penetrate_ the earth by means of a spade, a plough, a knife, or various other instruments; but one _pierces_ the flesh by means of a needle, or one _pierces_ the ground or a wall by means of a pickaxe.  
To _perforate_ and _bore_ are modes of _piercing_ that vary in the circumstances of the action and the objects acted upon; to _pierce_, in its peculiar use, is a sudden action by which a hollow is produced in any substance; but to _perforate_ and _bore_ are commonly the effect of mechanical art. The body of an animal is _pierced_ by a dart; but cannon is made by _perforating_ or _boring_ the iron: channels are formed underground by _perforating_ the earth; holes are made in the ear by _perforation;_ holes are made in the leather, or in the wood, _by boring;_ these last two words do not differ in sense, but in application, the latter being a term of vulgar use, though sometimes used in poetry.  
To _penetrate_ and _pierce_ are likewise employed in an improper sense; to _perforate_ and _bore_ are employed only in the proper sense. The first two bear the same relation to each other as in the former case: _penetrate_ is, however, employed only as the act of persons; _pierce_ is used in regard to things. There is a power in the mind to _penetrate_ the looks and actions, so as justly to interpret their meaning; the eye of the Almighty is said to _pierce_ the thickest veil of darkness. Affairs are sometimes involved in such mystery that the most enlightened is unable to _penetrate_ either the end or the beginning; the shrieks of distress are sometimes so loud as to seem to _pierce_ the ear. See also [thrill](entry://thrill)  
**PENETRATION, ACUTENESS, SAGACITY.** — As characteristics of mind, these terms have much more in them in which they differ than in what they agree: _penetration_ is a necessary property of mind; it exists to a greater or less degree in every rational being that has the due exercise of its rational powers; _acuteness_ is an accidental property that belongs to the mind only, under certain circumstances. As _penetration_ (see [discernment](entry://discernment)) denotes the process of entering into substances physically or morally, so _acuteness_, which is the same as sharpness, from _acutus_, sharp, denotes the fitness of the thing that performs this process: and as the mind is in both cases the thing that is spoken of, the terms _penetration_ and _acuteness_ are in this particular closely allied. It is clear, however, that the mind may have _penetration_ without having _acuteness_, although one cannot have _acuteness_ without _penetration._ If by _penetration_ we are commonly enabled to get at the truth which lies concealed, by _acuteness_ we succeed in piercing the veil that hides it from our view; the former is, therefore, an ordinary, and the latter an extraordinary, gift.  
_Sagacity_ is in Latin _sagacitas_, from _sagire_, to perceive by the senses. The term has been applied to animals which discover an intuitive wisdom, and also to children, or uneducated persons, in whom there is more _penetration_ than may be expected from the narrow compass of their knowledge; hence, properly speaking, _sagacity_ is natural or Uncultivated _acuteness._

####people 
**PEOPLE, NATION.**  
_People_ is derived through French from the Latin _populus._ The simple idea of numbers is expressed by the word _people:_ but the term _nation_, from _natio_ and _natus_, born, marks the connection of numbers by birth; _people_ is, therefore, the generic, and _nation_ the specific, term. A _nation_ is a _people_ connected by birth; there cannot, therefore, strictly speaking, be a _nation_ without a _people:_ but there may be a _people_ where there is not a _nation._ The Jews, when considered as an assemblage, under the special direction of the Almighty, are termed the _people_ of God, but when considered in regard to their common origin, they are denominated the Jewish _nation._ The Americans, when spoken of in relation to the British, are a distinct _people_, because they have a distinct government; but they are not a distinct _nation_, because they have a common descent. On this ground the Romans are not called the Roman _nation_, because their origin was so various, but the Roman _people_, that is, an assemblage living under one form of government.  
In a still closer application, _people_ if taken for a part of the state, namely, that part of a state which consists of a multitude, in distinction from its government; whence arises a distinction in the use of the terms; for we may speak of the British _people_, the French or the Dutch _people_, when we wish merely to talk of the mass, but we speak of the British _nation_, the French _nation_, and the Dutch _nation_, when public measures are in question, which emanate from the government or the whole _people._ The English _people_ have ever been remarkable for their attachment to liberty: the abolition of the slave-trade is one of the most glorious acts of public justice which were ever performed by the British _nation._ Upon the same ground republican states are distinguished by the name of _people:_ but kingdoms are commonly spoken of in history as _nations._ Hence we say the Spartan _people_, the Athenian _people_, the _people_ of Genoa, the _people_ of Venice, but the _nations_ of Europe, the African _nations_, the English, French, German, and Italian _nations._  
**PEOPLE, POPULACE, MOB.** — _People_ and _populace_ are evidently changes of the same word to express a number. The signification of these terms is that of a number gathered together. _People_ is said of any body supposed to be assembled, as well as really assembled: _populace_ is said of a body only when actually assembled. The voice of the _people_ is sometimes too loud to be disregarded; the _populace_ in England are fond of dragging their favorites in carriages.  
_Mob_ and _mobility_ are from the Latin _mobilis_, signifying movableness, which is the characteristic of the multitude: hence Virgil's _mobile vulgus._ (The word _mobile_ was used in this sense in England at the end of the seventeenth century.) The term _mob_, therefore, designates not only what is low, but tumultuous. A _mob_ is at all times an object of terror that mostly goes from bad to worse. _Mobility_, as an adjective, is used in its etymological sense to-day.  
**PEOPLE, PERSONS, FOLKS.** — The term _people_ has already been considered in two acceptations under the general idea of an assembly; but in the present case it is employed to express a small number of individuals: the word _people_, however, is always considered as one undivided body, and the word _person_ may be distinctly used either in the singular or in the plural; as we cannot say one, two, three, or four _people:_ but we may say one, two, three, or four _persons:_ yet, on the other hand, we may indifferently say, such _people_ or _persons;_ many _people_ or _persons;_ some _people_ or _persons_, and the like.  
With regard to the use of these terms, which is altogether colloquial, _people_ is employed in general propositions, and _persons_ in those which are specific or referring directly to some particular individuals: _people_ are generally of that opinion; some _people_ think so; some _people_ attended: there were but few _persons_ present at the entertainment; the whole company consisted of six _persons._  
As the term _people_ is employed to designate the promiscuous multitude, it has acquired a certain meanness of acceptation which makes it less suitable than the word _persons_, when _people_ of respectability are referred to: were I to say of any individuals I do not know who the _people_ are, it would not be so respectful as to say, I do not know who those _persons_ are: in like manner one says, from _people_ of that stamp one can expect nothing better; _persons_ of their appearance do not frequent such places.  
_Folks_, Anglo-Saxon _folc_, is a homely and familiar word; it is not unusual to say good _people_ or good _folks;_ and in speaking jocularly to one's friends the latter term is likewise admissible: but in the serious style it is never employed except in a disrespectful manner: such _folks_ (speaking of gamesters) are often put to sorry shifts.

####perceive 
**PERCEIVE, DISCERN, DISTINGUISH.**  
To _perceive_, in Latin _percipio_, or _per_, an intensive prefix, through, or thoroughly, and a weak form of _capere_, signifying to take hold of, is a positive, to _discern_ (see [discernment](entry://discernment)) a relative, action: we _perceive_ things by themselves; we _discern_ them amidst many others: we _perceive_ that which is obvious; we _discern_ that which is remote or which requires much attention to get an idea of it. We _perceive_ by a person's looks and words what he intends; we _discern_ the drift of his actions. We may _perceive_ sensible or spiritual objects; we commonly _discern_ only that which is spiritual: we _perceive_ light, darkness, colors, or the truth or falsehood of anything; we _discern_ characters, motives, the tendency and consequences of actions, etc. It is the act of a child to _perceive_ according to the quickness of its senses; it is the act of a man to _discern_ according to the measure of his knowledge and understanding.  
To _discern_ and _distinguish_ (see **difference** under [differ](entry://differ)) approach the nearest in sense to each other; but the former signifies to see only one thing, the latter to see two or more in quick succession so as to compare them. We _discern_ what lies in things: we _distinguish_ things according to their outward marks; we _discern_ things in order to understand their essences; we _distinguish_ in order not to confound them. Experienced and discreet people may _discern_ the signs of the times; it is just to _distinguish_ between an action done from inadvertence and that which is done from design. The conduct of people is sometimes so veiled by art that it is not easy to _discern_ their object: it is necessary to _distinguish_ between practice and profession. See also [see](entry://see)  
**PERCEPTION, IDEA, CONCEPTION, NOTION.** — _Perception_ expresses either the act of _perceiving_ or the impression produced by that act; in this latter sense it is analogous to an _idea_ (see [idea](entry://idea)). The impression of an object that is present to us is termed a _perception;_ the revival of that impression, when the object is removed, is an _idea._ A combination of _ideas_ by which any image is presented to the mind is a _conception_ (see [comprehend](entry://comprehend)); the association of two or more _ideas_ so as to constitute a decision is a _notion_ (see **opinion** under [opinionated](entry://opinionated)). _Perceptions_ are clear or confused, according to the state of the sensible organs and the _perceptive_ faculty; _ideas_ are faint or vivid, vague or distinct, according to the nature of the _perception; conceptions_ are gross or refined according to number and extent of one's _ideas; notions_ are true or false, correct or incorrect, according to the extent of one's knowledge. The _perception_ which we have of remote objects is sometimes so indistinct as to leave hardly any traces of the image on the mind; we have in that case a _perception_, but not an _idea:_ if we read the description of any object we may have an _idea_ of it; but we need not have any immediate _perception:_ the _idea_ in this case being complex, and formed of many images of which we have already had a _perception._  
If we present objects to our minds, according to different images which have already been impressed, we are said to have a _conception_ of them: in this case, however, it is not necessary for the objects really to exist; they may be the product of the mind's operation within itself: but with regard to _notions_ it is different, for they are formed respecting objects that do really exist, although perhaps the properties or circumstances which we assign to them are not real. If I look at the moon, I have a _perception_ of it; if it disappear from my sight, and the impression remains, I have an _idea_ of it; if an object, differing in shape and color from anything else which I may have seen, presents itself to my mind, it is a _conception;_ if of this moon I conceive that it is no bigger than what it appears to my eye, this is a _notion_ which, in the present instance, assigns an unreal property to a real object.

####periscope 
**PERISCOPE, ALTISCOPE, TELESCOPE**.  
_Periscope_, a compound of the Greek _περί_, around, and _σκοπείν_, look, signifies, literally, a general view or a view on all sides, and, specifically, spectacles with concavo-convex glasses constructed to increase the distinctness of objects when viewed obliquely. As a substantive the term has a distinctive application to a form of telescope by which an observer is enabled to see over a parapet, wall, and other parts of a fortification, known as an _altiscope_, from the Latin _alius_, high, and _σκοπείν_, to see. It consists of a telescopic tube with a right angle at the top and a reverse right angle at the bottom, with mirrors arranged at these points.  
A _periscope_, with which term the world became more familiar during the great European war, is an improved form of the _altiscope_, having at the top a lenticular total-reflection prism instead of a mirror, and turning upon a vertical axis, so that it is capable of sweeping the entire horizon. It is the slender instrument that rises above the surface from the body of a submarine when sufficiently submerged to be out of sight, with which the navigator scans the horizon and directs the craft for attacking another vessel. 

####perish 
**PERISH, DIE, DECAY.**  
To _perish_, in French _périr_, in Latin _pereo_, compounded of _per_ and _eo_, signifying to go thoroughly away, expresses more than to _die_ (see [die](entry://die)), and is applicable to many objects; for the latter is properly applied only to express the extinction of animal life, and figuratively to express the extinction of life or spirit in vegetables or other bodies; but the former is applied to express the dissolution of substances, so that they lose their existence as aggregate bodies. What _perishes_, therefore, does not always _die_, although whatever _dies_ by that very act _perishes_ to a certain extent. Hence we say that wood _perishes_, although it does not _die;_ people are said either to _perish_ or _die:_ but as the term _perish_ expresses even more than _dying_, it is possible for the same thing to _die_ and not _perish;_ thus a plant may be said to _die_ when it loses its vegetative power; but it is said to _perish_ if its substance crumbles into dust.  
To _perish_ expresses the end; to _decay_ the process by which this end is brought about: a thing may be long in _decaying_, but when it _perishes_ it ceases at once to act or to exist: things may, therefore, _perish_ without _decaying;_ they may likewise _decay_ without _perishing._ Things which are altogether new, and have experienced no kind of _decay_, may _perish_ by means of water, fire, lightning, and the like: on the other hand, wood, iron, and other substances may begin to _decay_, but may be saved from immediately _perishing_ by the application of preventives.

####perpetrate 
**PERPETRATE, COMMIT.**  
The idea of doing something wrong is common to these terms; but _perpetrate_, from the Latin _per_, intensive, and _patrare_, signifying thoroughly to compass or bring about, is a much more determined proceeding than that of _committing._ One may _commit_ offences of various degrees and magnitude; but one _perpetrates_ crimes only, and those of the more heinous kind. Lawless banditti, who spend their lives in the _perpetration_ of the most monstrous crimes, are not to be restrained by the ordinary course of justice; he who _commits_ any offence against the good order of society exposes himself to the censure of others who, in certain respects, may be his inferiors.

####persuade 
**PERSUADE, ENTICE, PREVAIL UPON.**  
_Persuade_ (see **conviction** under [convict](entry://convict)) and _entice_ (see [allure](entry://allure)) are employed to express different means to the same end, namely, that of drawing any one to a thing: one _persuades_ a person by means of words; one _entices_ him either by words or actions; one may _persuade_ either to a good or bad thing; but one _entices_ commonly to that which is bad; one uses arguments to _persuade_, and arts to _entice. Persuade_ and _entice_ comprehend either the means or the end, or both; _prevail upon_ comprehends no more than the end: we may _persuade_ without _prevailing upon_, and we may _prevail upon_ without _persuading._ Many will turn a deaf ear to all our _persuasions_, and will not be _prevailed upon_, although _persuaded:_ on the other hand, we may be _prevailed upon_ by the force of remonstrance, authority, and the like; and in this case we are _prevailed upon_ without being _persuaded._ We should never _persuade_ another to do that which we are not willing to do ourselves; credulous or good-natured people are easily _prevailed upon_ to do things which tend to their own injury.

####pessimistic 
**PESSIMISTIC, DESPONDING, GLOOMY.**  
_Pessimistic_ is a term derived from the Latin _pessimus_, the worst. _Desponding_ comes from Latin _de_, away, and _spondere_, to promise, and means literally promising away, yielding up wholly, hence despairing. _Gloomy_ comes from Middle English _gloumen_, to lower. These three words are used to describe a disposition which is inclined to "look on the dark side of things, " to give up hope. _Pessimistic_ describes an intellectual attitude; _desponding_, an emotional state. The _pessimistic_ man believes that things are worse than they are; the _desponding_ man, holding such a belief, yields up all hope. _Desponding_ indicates an abnormal psychological condition, and is a much stronger word than _pessimistic._ We may feel _pessimistic_ about all sorts of trivial matters; we become _desponding_ when something vital to happiness _has_ been taken away, thereby, as it were, destroying the emotional balance. _Gloomy_ is a word descriptive of manner, mood, and temperament rather than of a distinct and positive emotional condition such as that indicated in _desponding._ The _gloomy_ man resembles a lowering sky; the light and sunshine seem to have been obliterated. But the word means little more than a general absence of cheerfulness, and suggests rather a diffused sadness, oftentimes without cause or object, than an intense and absolute hopelessness.

**PICTURE, PRINT, ENGRAVING.**  
_Picture_ (see [paint](entry://paint)) is any likeness taken by the hand of the artist: the _print_ is the copy of the painting in a _printed_ state; and the _engraving_ is that which is produced by an _engraver:_ every _engraving_ is a _print;_ but every _print_ is not an _engraving;_ for the _picture_, as in the case of woodcuts, may be _printed_ from something besides an _engraving._ The term _picture_ is sometimes used for any representation of a likeness, without regard to the process by which it is formed: in this case it is employed mostly for the representations of the common kind that are found in books; but _print_ and _engraving_ are said of the higher specimens of the art. On certain occasions the word _engraving_ is most appropriate, as to take an _engraving_ of a particular object; on the other occasions the word _print_, as a handsome _print_, or a large _print._

####pillar 
**PILLAR, COLUMN.**  
_Pillar_ comes from Latin _pila_, a pier of stone. _Column_ is in Latin _columna_, allied to _collis_, hill, and _culmen_, a summit (whence our word _culminate)_, indicating a shaft which reaches upward. Both words are applied to the same object, namely, to whatever is artificially set up in wood, stone, or other hard material; but the word _pillar_, having come first into use, is the most general in its application to any structure, whether rude or otherwise; the term _column_, on the other hand, is applied to whatever is ornamental, as the Grecian order of _columns._  
So in poetry, where simply a support is spoken of, the term _pillar_ may be used.  
But where grandeur or embellishment is to be expressed, the term _column._  
Both terms are applied to other objects having a similarity either of form or of use. Whatever is set up in the form of a _pillar_ is so denominated; as, stone _pillars_ in cross ways, or over graves, and the like.  
Whatever is drawn out in the form of a _column_, be the material of which it is composed what it may, it is denominated a _column;_ as a _column_ of water, smoke, etc.; a _column_ of men, a _column_ of a page.  
_Pillar_ is frequently employed in a moral application, and in that case it always implies a support.

####piteous 
**PITEOUS, DOLEFUL, WOFUL, RUEFUL.**  
_Piteous_ signifies moving _pity_ (see **pity** under [piteous](entry://piteous)). _Doleful_, or full of _dole_, in Latin _dolor_, pain, signifies indicative of much pain. _Woful_, or full of _woe_, signifies likewise indicative of _woe_ (see WOE). _Rueful_, or full of _rue_, comes from Anglo-Saxon _hreowan_, to be sorry, and signifies indicative of much sorrow.  
The close alliance in sense of these words one to another is obvious from the above explanation; _piteous_ is applicable to one's external expression of bodily or mental pain; a child makes _piteous_ lamentations when it suffers from hunger or has lost its way; _doleful_ applies to those sounds which convey the idea of pain; there is something _doleful_ in the tolling of a funeral bell or in the sound of a muffled drum: _woful_ applies to the circumstances and situations of men; a scene is _woful_ in which we witness a large family of young children suffering from sickness and want; _rueful_ applies to the outward indications of inward sorrow depicted in the looks or countenance. The term is commonly applied to the sorrows which spring from a gloomy or distorted imagination, and has therefore acquired a somewhat ludicrous acceptation; hence we find Cervantes's characterization of Don Quixote rendered in English as the knight of the _rueful_ countenance.  
**PITIABLE, PITEOUS, PITIFUL.** — These three epithets drawn from the same word have shades of difference in sense and application. _Pitiable_ signifies deserving of _pity; piteous_, moving _pity; pitiful_, full of that which awakens _pity;_ a condition is _pitiable_ which is so distressing as to call forth _pity;_ a cry is _piteous_ which indicates such distress as can excite _pity;_ a conduct is _pitiful_ which marks a character entitled to _pity._ The first of these terms is taken in the best sense of the term _pity;_ the last two in its unfavorable sense: what is _pitiable_ in a person is independent of anything in himself; circumstances have rendered him _pitiable;_ what is _piteous_ and _pitiful_ in a man arises from the helplessness and imbecility or worthlessness of his character; the former connotes that which is weak; the latter that which is worthless in him: when a poor creature makes _piteous_ moans, it indicates his incapacity to help himself, as he ought to do, out of his troubles; when a man of rank has recourse to _pitiful_ shifts to gain his ends, he betrays the innate meanness of his soul.  
See also [contemptible](entry://contemptible); [mean](entry://mean)  
**PITY, COMPASSION.** — _Pity_ is contracted from Latin _pietas_, English _piety_, from _pius_, which signified attentive to all natural duties, and implied especially a religious devotion to the gods and to parents and family. _Compassion_, in Latin _compassio_, from _con_, with, and _passus_, past participle of _pati_, to suffer, signifies to suffer in conjunction with another.  
The pain which one feels at the distress of another is the idea that is common to the signification of both these terms, but they differ in the object that causes the distress: the former is excited principally by the weakness or degraded condition of the subject; the latter by his uncontrollable and inevitable misfortunes. We _pity_ a man of weak understanding who exposes his weakness: we _compassionate_ the man who is reduced to a state of beggary and want. _Pity_ is kindly extended by those in higher condition to such as are humble in their outward circumstances; the poor are at all times deserving of _pity_, even when their poverty is the positive fruit of vice: _compassion_ is a sentiment which extends to persons in all conditions; the Good Samaritan had _compassion_ on the traveller who fell among thieves. _Pity_, though a tender sentiment, is so closely allied to contempt that an understanding person is always loath to be the subject of it, since it can never be awakened but by some circumstance of inferiority; it hurts the honest pride of a man to reflect that he can excite no interest but by provoking a comparison to his own disadvantage: on the other hand, such is the general infirmity of our natures, and such our exposure to the casualties of human life, that _compassion_ is a pure and delightful sentiment that is reciprocally bestowed and acknowledged by all with equal satisfaction.  
**PITY, MERCY.** — The feelings one indulges, and the conduct one adopts, toward others who suffer through their own fault, are the common ideas which render these terms synonymous; but _pity_ lays hold of those circumstances which do not affect the moral character or which diminish the culpability of the individual: _mercy_ lays hold of those external circumstances which may diminish punishment. _Pity_ is often a sentiment unaccompanied with action; _mercy_ is often a mode of action unaccompanied with sentiment: we have or take _pity_ upon a person, but we show _mercy_ to a person. _Pity_ is bestowed by men in their domestic and private capacity; _mercy_ is shown in the exercise of power: a master has _pity_ upon his offending servant by passing over his offences and affording him the opportunity of amendment; the magistrate shows _mercy_ to a criminal by diminishing his punishment. _Pity_ lies in the breast of an individual and may be bestowed at his discretion: _mercy_ is restricted by the rules of civil society; it must not interfere with the administration of justice. Young offenders call for great _pity_, as their offences are often the fruit of inexperience and bad example rather than of depravity: _mercy_ is an imperative duty in those who have the power of inflicting punishment, particularly in cases where life and death are concerned.  
_Pity_ and _mercy_ are likewise applied to the animal creation with a similar distinction: _pity_ shows itself in relieving real misery and in lightening burdens; _mercy_ is displayed in the measure of pain which one inflicts. One takes _pity_ on a poor animal to whom one gives food to relieve hunger; one shows it _mercy_ by abstaining from beating it.  
These terms are, moreover, applicable to the Deity, in regard to His creatures, particularly man. God takes _pity_ on us as entire dependents upon Him: he extends His _mercy_ toward us as offenders against Him: He shows His _pity_ by relieving our wants; He shows His _mercy_ by forgiving our sins.

####place 
**PLACE, STATION, SITUATION, POSITION, POST.**  
_Place_, from Latin _platea_, Greek _πλατεία_, a broad way, is the abstract or general term that comprehends the idea of any given space that may be occupied: _station_ (see [condition](entry://condition)) is the _place_ where one stands or is fixed: _situation_, in Latin _situs_, a place, and _position_, from _positus_, the past participle of _ponere_, to place, signify the. object as well as the place; that is, they signify how the object is put, as well as where it is put. A _place_ or _station_ may be either vacant or otherwise; a _situation_ and a _position_ necessarily suppose some occupied _place_, A _place_ is either assigned or not assigned, known or unknown, real or supposed: a _station_ is a specifically assigned _place._ We choose a _place_ according to our convenience, and we leave it again at pleasure; but we take up our _station_ and hold it for a given period. One inquires for a _place_ which is known only by name; the _station_ is appointed for us, and is, therefore, easily found. Travellers wander from _place_ to _place;_ soldiers have always some _station._  
The terms _place_ and _situation_ are said of objects animate or inanimate; _station_ only of animate objects, or those which are figuratively considered as such; _position_ properly of inanimate objects, or those which are considered as such: a person chooses a _place;_ a thing occupies a _place_, or has a _place_ set apart for it: a _station_ or _stated_ place must always be assigned to each person who has to act in concert with others; a _situation_ or _position_ is chosen for a thing to suit the convenience of an individual: the former is said of things as they stand with regard to others; the latter of things as they stand with regard to themselves. The _situation_ of a house comprehends the nature of the _place_, whether on high or low ground, and also its relation to other objects, that is, whether higher or lower, nearer or more distant: the _position_ of a window in a house is considered as to whether it is straight or crooked; the _position_ of a book is considered as to whether it stands leaning or upright, with its face or back forward. _Situation_ is, moreover, said of things that come there of themselves; _position_ only of those things which have been put there at will. The _situation_ of some tree or rock, on some elevated _place_, is agreeable to be looked at or to be looked from. The faulty _position_ of a letter in writing sometimes spoils the whole performance.  
_Situation_ and _position_ when applied to persons are similarly distinguished; the _situation_ is that in which a man finds himself, either with or without his own choice; the _position_ is that in which he is placed without his own choice.  
_Place, situation_, and _station_ have an extended signification in respect to men in civil society, that is, either to their circumstances or actions; _post_ has no other sense when applied to persons. _Place_ is as indefinite as before; it may be taken for that share which we personally have in society either generally, as when every one is said to fill a _place_ in society, or particularly for a specific share of its business, as to fill a _place_ under government: _situation_ is that kind of _place_ which specifies cither our share in its business, but with a higher import than the general term _place_, or a share in its gains and losses, as the prosperous or adverse _situation_ of a man: a _station_ is that kind of _place_ which denotes a share in its relative consequence, power, and honor, in which sense every man holds a certain _station;_ the _post_ is that kind of _place_ in which he has a specific share in the duties of society; the _situation_ comprehends many duties, but the _post_ includes properly one duty only, the word being figuratively employed from the _post_ or particular spot which a soldier is said to occupy. A clerk in a counting-house fills a _place:_ a clergyman holds a _situation_ by virtue of his office; he is in the _station_ of a gentleman by reason of his education as well as his _situation:_ a faithful minister will always consider his _post_ to be there where good is to be done.  
See [office](entry://office); [put](entry://put)  
**PLACE, DISPOSE, ORDER.** — To _place_ is to assign a _place_ to a thing; to _dispose_ is to _place_ according to a certain rule; to _order_ is to _place_ in a certain _order._ To _place_ is an unqualified act both as to the manner and circumstances of the action; to _dispose_ is α qualified act; it is qualified as to the manner; the former is an act of expediency or necessity; the latter is an act of judgment or discretion. Things are often _placed_ from the necessity of being _placed_ in some way or another: they are _disposed_ so as to appear to the best advantage. We may _place_ a single object, but it is necessary that there should be several objects to be _disposed._ One _places_ a book on a shelf, or _disposes_ a number of books, according to their sizes, on different shelves.  
To _order_ and _dispose_ are both taken in the sense of putting several things in some _order_, but dispose may be simply for the purpose of _order_ and arrangement; _ordering_, on the other hand, comprehends command as well as regulation. Things are _disposed_ in a shop to the best advantage, or, in the moral application, the thoughts are _disposed;_ a man _orders_ his family, or a commander _orders_ the battle.  
**PLACE, SPOT, SITE.** — A particular or given space is the idea common to these terms; but the former is general and indefinite, the latter specific. _Place_ is limited to no size or quantity; it may be large: but _spot_ implies a very small _place_, such as, by a figure of speech, is supposed to be no larger than a _spot:_ the term _place_ is employed upon every occasion; the term _spot_ is confined to very particular cases: we may often know in a general way the _place_ where a thing is, but it is not easy after a series of years to find out the exact _spot_ on which some event has happened. The _place_ where our Saviour was buried is to be seen and pointed out, but not the very _spot_ where he lay.  
The _site_ is the _spot_ on which anything stands or is situated; it is more commonly applied to a building or any _place_ marked out for a specific purpose; as the _site_ on which a camp had been formed.

####play 
**PLAY, GAME, SPORT.**  
_Play_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _plegian_, from _plega_, a fight, battle, sport. _Game_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _gamen_, to play. _Sport_ is derived from Old French _disport_, from the phrase _se desporter_ (Latin _dis_, apart, and _portare_, to carry), meaning to carry one's self away from work or annoyance.  
_Play_ and _game_ both include exercise, corporeal or mental, or both; but _play_ is an unsystematic, _game_ a systematic, exercise: children _play_ when they merely run after each other, but this is no _game;_ on the other hand, when they exercise with the ball according to any rule, this is a _game;_ every _game_, therefore, is a _play_, but every _play_ is not a _game:_ trundling a hoop is a _play_, but not a _game:_ cricket is both a _play_ and a _game._ One person may have his _play_ by himself, but there must be more than one to have a _game. Play_ is adapted to infants; _games_ to those who are more advanced in years. _Play_ is sometimes taken for the act of amusing one's self with anything intellectual, and _game_ for the act with which any _game_ is _played. Play_ and _sport_ signify any action or motion for pleasure, whether as it regards man or animals; but _play_ refers more to the action, and _sport_ to the pleasure produced by the action.  
_Game_ and _sport_ both imply an object pursued, but _game_ comprehends an object of contest which is to be obtained by art, as the Olympic and other _games_ of antiquity.  
_Sport_ comprehends a pleasurable object to be obtained by bodily exercise; as field _sports_, rustic _sports_, and the like.  
_Game_ may be extended figuratively to any object of pursuit; as the _game_ is lost, the _game_ is over.  
_Sport_ is sometimes used for the subject of _sport_ to another.  
**PLAYFUL, SPORTIVE.** — _Playful_, or full of _play_, and _sportive_, disposed to _sport_, are taken in a sense similar to the primitive. _Playful_ is applicable to youth or childhood, when there is the greatest disposition to _play. Sportive_ is applied in a good sense to persons of maturer years. A person may be said to be _sportive_ who indulges in harmless _sport._

####pleasure 
**PLEASURE, JOY, DELIGHT, CHARM.**  
_Pleasure_, through French _plaisir_, from the Latin _placere_, to please or give content, is the generic term, involving in itself the common idea of the other terms. _Joy_ (see [glad](entry://glad)). _Delight_, from French _déliter_, Latin _delectare_, a frequentative of _delicere_, to allure (whence our adjective _delicious_ is derived), signifies what allures the mind.  
_Pleasure_ is a term of most extensive use; it embraces one large class of our feelings and sensations, and is opposed to nothing but pain, which embraces the second class or division: _joy_ and _delight_ are but modes or modifications of _pleasure_, differing as to the degree and as to the objects or sources. _Pleasure_, in its peculiar acceptation, is smaller in degree than either _joy_ or _delight_, but in its universal acceptation it defines no degree: the term is indifferently employed for the highest as well as the lowest degree: whereas _joy_ and _delight_ can be employed only to express a positively high degree. _Pleasure_ is produced by any or every object; everything by which we are surrounded acts upon us more or less to produce it; we may have _pleasure_ either from without or from within: _pleasure_ from the gratification of our senses, from the exercise of our affections, or the exercise of our understandings; _pleasures_ from our own selves or _pleasures_ from others: but _joy_ is derived from the exercise of the affections; and _delight_ either from the emotions or the understanding. In this manner we distinguish the _pleasures_ of the table, social _pleasures_, or intellectual _pleasures; the joy_ of meeting an old friend; or the _delight_ of pursuing a favorite object.  
_Pleasures_ are either transitory or otherwise: _joy_ is in its nature commonly short of duration; it springs from particular events; it is _pleasure_ at high tide, but it may come and go as suddenly as the events which caused it: one's _joy_ may be awakened and destroyed in quick succession. _Delight_ is more fleeting even than _joy_, and much more intense than simple _pleasure; delight_ arises from a state of outward circumstances which is naturally less durable than that of _joy;_ but it is a state seldomer attainable and not so much at one's command as either _pleasure_ or _joy. Pleasure, joy_, and _delight_ are likewise employed for the things which give _pleasure, joy_, or _delight. Charm_ (see **attraction** under [attract](entry://attract)) is used only in the sense of what _charms_ or gives a high degree of _pleasure_, but not a degree equal to that of _joy_ or _delight_, though greater than of ordinary _pleasure; pleasure_ intoxicates; the _joys_ of heaven are objects of a Christian's pursuit; the _delights_ of matrimony are lasting _to_ those who are susceptible of true affection; the _charms_ of rural scenery never fail of their effect whenever they offer themselves to the eye.

####plentiful 
**PLENTIFUL, PLENTEOUS, ABUNDANT, COPIOUS, AMPLE.**  
_Plentiful_ and _plenteous_, signifying the presence of _plenty, plenitude_, or _fulness_, differ only in use, the former being mostly employed in the familiar, the latter in the grave, style. _Plenty_ fills; _abundance_, in Latin _abundantia_ (from _abundo_, to overflow, compounded of the intensive _ab_ and _unda_, a wave, signifying, literally, overflowing), does more, it leaves a superfluity; as that, however, which fills suffices as much as that which flows over, the term _abundance_ is often employed promiscuously with that of _plenty;_ we may say indifferently a _plentiful_ harvest or an _abundant_ harvest. _Plentiful_ is, however, a more familiar term than _abundant:_ we say, therefore, most commonly, _plenty_ of provisions; _plenty_ of food; _plenty_ of corn, wine, and oil: but an _abundance_ of words; an _abundance_ of riches; an _abundance_ of wit or humor. In certain years fruit is _plentiful_, and at other times grain is _plentiful;_ in all cases we have _abundant_ cause for gratitude to the Giver of all good things.  
_Copious_, in Latin _copiosus_, from _copia_, or _con_, together, and _opes_, wealth, signifying having a store, and _ample_, from Latin _amplus_, spacious, are modes either of _plenty_ or _abundance:_ the former is employed in regard to what is collected or brought into one place; the term _ample_ is employed only in regard to what may be narrowed or expanded; a _copious_ stream of blood, or a _copious_ flow of words, equally designate the quantity which is collected, as an _ample_ provision, an _ample_ store, an _ample_ share, marks that which may at pleasure be increased or diminished.

####plunge 
**PLUNGE, DIVE.**  
_Plunge_ comes from a hypothetical Latin _plumbicare_, based on _plumbum_, lead, through French _plonger_, and means to fall into the water like the lead thrown out to _plumb_ the depth. _Dive_, from Anglo-Saxon _dyfan_, to immerse, is allied to _dip, deep_, etc.  
One _plunges_ sometimes in order to _dive;_ but one may _plunge_ without _diving_, and one may _dive_ without _plunging:_ to _plunge_ is to dart head foremost into the water: to _dive_ is to go to the bottom of the water or toward it; it is a good practice for bathers to _plunge_ into the water when they first go in, although it is not advisable for them to _dive;_ ducks frequently _dive_ into the water without ever _plunging._ Thus far they differ in their natural sense; but in the figurative application they differ more widely: to _plunge_, in this case, is an act of rashness: to _dive_ is an act of design: a young man hurried away by his passions will _plunge_ into every extravagance when he cornea into possession of his estate: a "nervy" speculator will often make a _plunge_ in the stock or commodities markets for control of an interest.

####poise 
**POISE, BALANCE.**  
For the derivations of _poise_ and _balance_ see [counterpoise](entry://counterpoise).  
To _poise_ is properly to keep the weight from pressing on either side; to _balance_ is to keep the _balance_ even. The idea of bringing into an equilibrium is common to both terms, but a thing is _poised_ as regards itself; it is _balanced_ as regards other things; a person _poises_ a plain stick in his hand when he wants it to lie even; he _balances_ the stick if it has a particular weight at each end: a person may _poise_ himself, but he _balances_ others: when not on firm ground it is necessary to _poise_ one's self; when two persons are situated one at each end of a beam they may _balance_ one another. In the moral application they are similarly distinguished.  
See also [counterpoise](entry://counterpoise)

####poison 
**POISON, VENOM.**  
_Poison_, in French _poison_, Latin _potio_, a drink, is a general term; in its original meaning it signifies any potion which acts destructively upon the system. _Venom_, in French _venin_, Latin _venenum_, is a species of deadly or malignant _poison:_ a _poison_ may be either slow or quick; a _venom_ is always most active in its nature: a _poison_ must be administered inwardly to have its effect; a _venom_ will act by an external application: the juice of the hellebore is a _poison;_ the tongue of the adder and the tooth of the viper contain _venom;_ many plants are unfit to be eaten on account of the _poisonous_ quality which is in them; the Indians are in the habit of dipping the tips of their arrows in a _venomous_ juice, which renders the slightest wound mortal.  
The moral application of these terms is clearly drawn from their proper acceptation: the _poison_ must be infused or injected into the subject; the _venom_ acts upon him externally: bad principles are justly compared to a _poison_, which some are so unhappy as to suck in with their mother's milk; the shafts of envy are peculiarly _venomous_ when directed against those in elevated stations. 

####polite 
**POLITE, POLISHED, REPINED.**  
_Polite_, from Latin _polire_, to make smooth (see [civil](entry://civil)), denotes a quality; _polished_, of a similar derivation, a state: he who is _polite_ is so according to the rules of _politeness;_ he who is _polished_ is _polished_ by the force of art: a _polite_ man is, in regard to his behavior, a finished gentleman; but a rude person may be more or less _polished_ and yet not free from rudeness. _Refined_ rises in sense, both in regard to _polite_ and _polished:_ a man is indebted to nature, rather than to art, for his _refinement;_ but his _politeness_ or his _polish_ is entirely the fruit of education. _Politeness_ and _polish_ do not extend to anything but externals; _refinement_ applies as much to the mind as the body: rules of conduct and good society will make a man _polite;_ lessons in dancing will serve to give a _polish; refined_ manners or principles will naturally arise out of _refinement_ of men.  
As _polish_ extends only to the exterior, it is less liable to excess than _refinement:_ when the language, the walk, and deportment of a man are _polished_, he is divested of all that can make him offensive in social intercourse; but if his temper be _refined_ beyond a certain boundary, he loses the energy of character which is essential for maintaining his dignity against the rude shocks of human life.

####political 
**POLITICAL, POLITIC.**  
_Political_ has the proper meaning of the word _polity_, which, from the Greek _πολιτεία_ and _πόλις_, a city, signifies the government either of a city or a country. _Politic_, like the word _policy_, has the improper meaning of the word _polity_, namely, that of clever management, because the affairs of states are sometimes managed with considerable art and finesse: hence we speak of _political_ government as opposed to that which is ecclesiastic; and of _politic_ conduct as opposed to that which is unwise and without foresight: in _political_ questions, it is not _politic_ for individuals to set themselves up in opposition to those who are in power; the study of _politics_, as a science, may make a man a clever statesman, but it may not always enable him to be truly _politic_ in his private concerns.

####poor 
**POOR, PAUPER.**  
_Poor_ and _pauper_ are both derived from the Latin _pauper_, Old French _povre_, poor. _Poor_ is a term of general use; _pauper_ is a term of particular use: a _pauper_ is a _poor_ man who lives upon alms or the relief of the parish: the former is, therefore, indefinite in its meaning; the latter conveys a reproachful idea. The word _poor_ is used as a substantive only in the plural number; _pauper_ is a substantive both in the singular and plural: the _poor_ of the parish are; in general, a heavy burden upon the inhabitants: there are some persons who are not ashamed to live and die as _paupers._

_Position_ (see also PLACE) is here the general term, _posture_ the particular term. The _position_ is that in which a body is placed in respect to other bodies: as the standing with one's face or back to an object is a _position;_ but a _posture_ is that _position_ which a body assumes in respect to itself, as a sitting or reclining _posture._  
See also [tenet](entry://tenet)

####positive 
**POSITIVE, ABSOLUTE, PEREMPTORY.**  
_Positive_, in Latin _positivus_, from _positus_, past participle of _pono_, to put or place, and a suffix, signifies placed or fixed, that is, fixed or established in the mind. _Absolute_, from Latin _ab_, away, and _solutus_, participle of _solvere_, to loosen, signifies uncontrolled by any external circumstances. _Peremptory_, in Latin _peremptorius_, from _peremptor_, a destroyer, _per_, utterly, and _emere_, to take, signifying to take away utterly, means removing all further question.  
_Positive_ and _absolute_ are employed for cither things or persons; _peremptory_ for persons only, or for that which is personal. What is _positive_ has a determinate existence; it is opposed to what is negative, indeterminate, or precarious; as _positive_ good, _positive_ pleasure or pain; what is _absolute_ is without dependence or connection, it is opposed mostly to the relative or conditional, as _absolute_ existence, _absolute_ justice.  
In regard to persons or what is personal, _positive_ applies either to the assurance of a man or to the manner of his expressing that assurance; a person may be _positive_ in his own mind (see **confident** under [confide](entry://confide)), or he may make a _positive_ assertion; _absolute_ applies either to the mode of acting or the circumstances under which one acts, as to have an _absolute_ possession or command, to make an _absolute_ promise; _peremptory_ is applied to the nature of the action or the manner of performing it; a command may be _peremptory_, and a tone _peremptory._ A _positive_ assertion will remove doubt if made by one entitled to credit; an _absolute_ promise will admit of no reservation on the part of the person making it. A _peremptory_ command admits of no demur or remonstrance; a _peremptory_ answer satisfies or puts to silence.

####possess 
See [hold](entry://hold)

####possessions 
See [goods](entry://goods)

####possessor 
**POSSESSOR, PROPRIETOR, OWNER, MASTER.**  
The _possessor_ has the full power, if not the right, of the present disposal over the object of possession; the _proprietor_ and _owner_ have the unlimited right of transfer, but not always the power of immediate disposal. The _proprietor_ and the _owner_ are the same in signification, though not in application, the first term being used principally in regard to matters of importance; the latter on familiar occasions: the _proprietor_ of an estate is a more suitable expression than the _owner_ of an estate: the _owner_ of a book is more becoming than the _proprietor._ The _possessor_ and the _master_ are commonly the same person when those things are in question which are subject to _possession;_ but the terms are otherwise so different in their original meaning that they can scarcely admit of comparison: the _possessor_ of a house is naturally the _master_ of the house; and, in general, whatever a man possesses that he has in his power and is consequently _master_ of; but we may have, legally, the right of _possessing_ a tiling over which we have actually no power of control: in this case, we are nominally possessor, but virtually not _master._ A minor, or insane person, may be both _possessor_ and _proprietor_ of that over which he has no control; a man is, therefore, on the other hand, appropriately denominated _master_, not _possessor_, of his actions. 

####possible 
**POSSIBLE, PRACTICABLE, PRACTICAL.**  
_Possible_, from the Latin _posse_, to be able, and a suffix, signifies properly able to be done: _practicable_, compounded of Latin _practicus_, Greek _πρακτικός_, from the verb signifying to do, and a suffix, signifies to be able to put in _practice:_ hence the difference between _possible_ and _practicable_ is the same as between doing a thing at all or doing it as a rule. There are many things _possible_ which cannot be called _practicable;_ but what is _practicable_ must, in its nature, be _possible._ The _possible_ depends solely on the power of the agent; the _practicable_ depends on circumstances: a child cannot say how much it is _possible_ for him to learn until he has tried; schemes have sometimes everything apparently to recommend them to notice, but that which is of the first importance, namely, their _practicability._  
The _practicable_ is that which may or can be _practiced;_ the _practical_ is that which is intended for _practice:_ the former, therefore, applies to that which men devise to carry into _practice:_ the latter to that which they have to _practice:_ projectors ought to consider what is _practicable;_ divines and moralists have to consider what is _practical._ The _practicable_ is opposed to the _impracticable;_ the _practical_ to the theoretical or speculative.

####pour 
**POUR, SPILL, SHED.**  
_Pour_ meant originally to purify or clarify by pressure, or pouring out, from Late Latin _purare_, Latin _purus_, pure. _Spill_ is a Scandinavian word meaning to destroy or shed. _Shed_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _sceadan._  
We _pour_ with design; we _spill_ by accident: we _pour_ water over a plant or a bed; we _spill_ it on the ground. To _pour_ is an act of convenience; to _spill_ and _shed_ are acts more or less hurtful; the former is to cause to run in small quantities, the latter in large quantities: we _pour_ wine out of a bottle into a glass; but the blood of a person is said to be _spilled_ or _shed_ when his life is violently taken away: what is _poured_ is commonly no part of the body whence it is _poured;_ but what is _shed_ is no other than a component part; hence trees are said to _shed_ their leaves, animals their hair, or human beings to _shed_ tears. Hence the distinction between these words in their moral application.

_Poverty_, through French from Latin _paupertatem_, based on _pauper_, poor, which marks the condition of being _poor_, is a general state of fortune opposed to that of riches.  
_Poverty_ admits of different states or degrees which are expressed by the other terms. _Want_, from the verb to _want_, denotes, when taken absolutely, the _want_ of the first necessaries, which is a permanent state, and a low state of _poverty;_ but it may sometimes denote an occasional _want_, as a traveller in a desert may be exposed to _want;_ or it may imply the _want_ of particular things, as when we speak of our _wants. Penury_, in Latin _penuria_, allied to Greek πείνα, hunger, signifying extreme _want_, is poverty in its most abject state, which is always supposed to be as permanent as it is wretched, to which those who are already poor are brought, either by misfortune or imprudence.  
_Indigence_, in Latin _indigentia_, from _indigere_, from _ind_, for, and _egere_, to be in _need_, to _want_, signifies the state of _wanting_ such things as one has been habituated to or which are suited to one's station, and is properly applied to persons in the superior walks of life.  
_Need_ (see **necessity** under [necessary](entry://necessary)) implies a present _want_, or the state of _wanting_ such things as the immediate occasion calls for: a temporary state to which persons of all conditions are exposed. 

####power 
**POWER, STRENGTH, FORCE, AUTHORITY, DOMINION.**  
_Power_, from Anglo-French _poër_, which in Middle English developed a _w_; Late Latin _potere_, to be able, is the generic and universal term, comprehending in it that simple principle of nature which exists in all subjects. _Strength_, or the abstract quality of strong, and _force_ (see [energy](entry://energy)) are modes of _power._ These terms are all used either in a physical or a moral application. _Power_, in a physical sense, signifies whatever causes motion: _strength_ that species of _power_ that lies in the vital and muscular parts of the body. _Strength_ is therefore internal, and depends on the internal organization of the frame; _power_ on the external circumstances. A man may have _strength_ to move, but not the _power_, if he be bound with cords. Our _strength_ is proportioned to the health of the body and the firmness of its make: our _power_ may be increased by the help of instruments. _Power_ may be exerted or otherwise; _force_ is _power_ exerted or active; bodies have a _power_ of resistance while in a state of rest, but they are moved by a certain _force_ from other bodies.  
The word _power is_ used technically for the moving _force._  
In a moral acceptation, _power, strength_, and _force_ may be applied to the same objects with a similar distinction: thus we may speak of the _power_ of language generally; the _strength_ of a person's expressions to convey the state of his own mind; and the _force_ of terms, as to the extent of their meaning and fitness to convey the ideas of those who use them.  
_Power_ is either public or private, which brings it into alliance with _authority_ (see [influence](entry://influence)). Civil _power_ includes in it all that which enables us to have any influence or control over the actions, persons, property, etc., of others; _authority_ is confined to that species of _power_ which is derived from some legitimate source. _Power_ exists independently of all right; _authority_ is founded only on right. A king has often the _power_ to be cruel, but he has never the _authority_ to be so. Subjects have sometimes the _power_ of overturning the government, but they can in no case have the _authority. Power_ is indefinite as to degree; one may have little or much _power: dominion_ is a positive degree of _power._ A monarch's _power_ may be limited by various circumstances; a despot exercises _dominion_ over all his subjects, high and low. One is not said to get _power_ over any object, but to get an object into one's _power:_ on the other hand, we get a _dominion_ over an object; thus some men have a _dominion_ over the conscience of others.  
**POWERFUL, POTENT, MIGHTY.** — _Powerful_ is full of _power; potent_, from the Latin _potens_, the present participle of the verb posse (whence _possible_ is derived), signifies, literally, being able or having _power_, and _mighty_ signifies having _might. Powerful_ is applicable to strength as well as _power:_ a _powerful_ man is one who by size and build can easily overpower another; and a _powerful_ person is one who has much in his _power: potent_ is used only in this latter sense, in which it expresses a larger extent of _power:_ a _potent_ monarch is much more than a _powerful_ prince: _mighty_ expresses a still higher degree of _power; might_ is _power_ unlimited by any consideration or circumstance; a giant is called _mighty_ in the physical sense, and genius is said to be _mighty_ which takes everything within its grasp; the Supreme Being is entitled either _Omnipotent_ or _Almighty;_ but the latter term seems to convey the idea of boundless extent more forcibly than the former.

####pragmatism 
**PRAGMATISM, PRACTICALISM, HUMANISM.**  
These words all refer to a recent philosophy, "the most recent and (philosophically speaking) fashionable 'ism' that the new century has produced, known by some as _Humanism_, and by others as _Pragmatism" (Academy_, August 4, 1906). The philosophy teaches that the whole meaning of a conception expresses itself in practical consequences, either in the shape of conduct to be recommended or of experiences to be expected, if it is true. In short, "if it works, it is true. " This was called _practicalism_ by some because the test of truth is its results in _practice_ (ultimately from Greek _πράττειν_, to do; but William James, the American exponent of the philosophy, gave it the name _pragmatism_, from the same Greek verb _πράττειν_, which has the same meaning as _practicalism_ but is a trifle more euphonious. _Humanism_, from Latin _humanus_, pertaining to man, from _homo_, man, is applied to the philosophy because it judges truth not by abstract or theoretical principles, but simply by its practical outcome in human life. But the objection to the title _humanism_ is that the word has already been applied to the work of the scholars of the Renaissance who revived the ideal of a perfect "human" life, on the basis of the Greek and Roman art, as contrasted with the spiritual ideal of the mediaeval theologians. Hence, when _humanism_ is used for _pragmatism_, there is confusion. As is the case with most new words, the difference between the synonymes is not one of meaning, but of customary usage. 

####praise 
**PRAISE, COMMEND, APPLAUD, EXTOL.**  
_Praise_, through French _preis_, is connected with our own word _price_ (Latin _pretium)_, signifying to give a value to a thing. _Commend_, in Latin _commendo_, compounded of _con_, together, and _mandare_, to put into the hands, signifies to commit to the good opinion of others. _Applaud_ (see [applause](entry://applause)). _Extol_, in Latin _ex_, beyond, and _tollere_, to lift, signifies to lift up very high.  
All these terms denote the act of expressing approbation. To _praise_ is the most general and indefinite; it may rise to a high degree, but it generally implies a lower degree: we _praise_ a person generally; we _commend_ him particularly, we _praise_ him for his diligence, sobriety, and the like; we _commend_ him for his performances, or for any particular instance of prudence or good conduct. To _applaud_ is an ardent mode of _praising;_ we _applaud_ a person for his nobility of spirit: to _extol_ is a reverential mode of _praising;_ we _extol_ a man for his heroic exploits. _Praise_ is confined to no station, though with most propriety bestowed by superiors on equals: _commendation_ is the part of a superior; a parent _commends_ his child for an act of charity: _applause_ is the act of many as well as of one; theatrical performances are the frequent subjects of public _applause: to extol_ is the act of inferiors, who declare thus decidedly their sense of a person's superiority.

####prayer 
**PRAYER, PETITION, REQUEST, ENTREATY, SUIT.**  
_Prayer_, from the Old French _preier_, Latin _precari_, to pray, is a general term, including the common idea of application to some person for any favor to be granted: _petition_, based on _petere_, to seek; _reguest_ (see [ask](entry://ask)); _entreaty_ (see [beg](entry://beg)); _suit_, from _sue_, in Anglo-French _suer_, Latin _sequi_, to follow after, denote different modes of _prayer_, varying in the circumstances of the action and the object acted upon.  
The _prayer_ is made more commonly to the Supreme Being; the _petition_ is made more generally to one's fellow-creatures; we may, however, _pray_ our fellow-creatures, and _petition_ our Creator: the _prayer_ is made for everything which is of the first importance to us as living beings; the _petition_ is made for that which may satisfy our desires: hence our _prayers_ to the Almighty concern all our circumstances as moral and responsible agents; our _petitions_ the temporary circumstances of our present existence.  
When the term _prayer_ is applied to men, it carries with it the idea of earnestness and submission; the _petition_ is a public act, in which many express their wishes to the Supreme Authority; the _request_ and _entreaty_ are individual acts between men in their private relations: the people _petition_ the king or the parliament; a child makes a _request_ to its parent; one friend makes a _request_ to another. The _request_ marks an equality, but the _entreaty_ defines no condition; it differs, however, from the former in the nature of the object and the mode of preferring; the _request_ is but a simple expression; the _entreaty_ is urgent: the _request_ may be made in trivial matters; the _entreaty_ is made in matters that deeply interest the feelings: we _request_ a friend to lend us a book; we use every _entreaty_ in order to divert a person from those purposes which we think detrimental: one complies with a _request;_ one yields to _entreaties._ It was the dying _request_ of Socrates that they would sacrifice a cock to Æsculapius; Regulus was deaf to every _entreaty_ of his friends, who wished him not to return to Carthage.  
The _suit_ is a higher kind of _prayer_, varying both in the nature of the subject and the character of the agent. A gentleman pays his _suit_ to a lady; a courtier makes his _suit_ to the prince: _suit_ in legal nomenclature meant originally a _petition_ or a _prayer._

####prelude 
**PRELUDE, PREFACE.**  
_Prelude_, from the Latin _prœ_, before, and _ludere_, to play; signifies the game that precedes another; _preface_, from the Latin _fari_, to speak, signifies the speech that precedes. The idea of a preparatory introduction is included in both these terms; but the former consists of actions, the latter of words: the throwing of stones and breaking of windows is the _prelude_ on the part of a mob to a general riot, and apology for one's ill behavior is sometimes the _preface_ to soliciting a remission of punishment. The _prelude_ is frequently, though not always, preparatory to that which is in itself actually bad: the _preface_ is either to guard against something objectionable or to secure something desirable. Intemperance in liquor is the _prelude_ to every other extravagance; when one wishes to insure compliance with a request that may possibly be unreasonable, it is necessary to pave the way by some suitable _preface._  
In the extended application they are both taken in an indifferent sense. 

####premeditate 
**PREMEDITATE, PLAN, PREARRANGE, PRECONTRIVE, PREDETERMINE, PROPOSE.**  
_Premeditate_, from Latin _prœ_, before, and _meditari_, to think, means to think over something beforehand. _Plan_, from Latin _planum_, a flat surface, means properly a drawing on a flat surface — hence an outline of what is to be done. It has, therefore, more specific reference to action than _premeditate. Precontrive_ means to _contrive_ beforehand. (For derivation and meaning see [contrive](entry://contrive).) It suggests a working out of petty details and adjustment of the relations of the parts of a plan, and is applied to comparatively small projects, whereas _plan_ may be applied to anything. _Prearrange_ (see [class](entry://class)) also suggests the adjustment beforehand, but not the petty ingenuity of _precontrive. Predetermine_ is to _determine_ beforehand (see [determine](entry://determine)), and _propose_, from Latin _pro_, before, and French _poser_, to place, has a similar meaning. But _propose_ means merely to place the possibility of a future course before the mind; _predetermine_ suggests also an action of the will. 

####premise 
**PREMISE, PRESUME.**  
_Premise_, from _prœ_ and _missum_, the past participle of _mittere_, signifies to set down beforehand; _presume_, from _prœ_ and _sumere_, to take, or take up, signifies to take up or accept beforehand. Both these terms are employed in regard to our previous assertions or admissions of any circumstance; the former is used for what is theoretical or belongs to opinions; the latter is used for what is practical or belongs to facts: we _premise_ that the existence of a Deity is unquestionable when we argue respecting His attributes; we _presume_ that a person has a firm belief in Divine revelation when we exhort him to follow the precepts of the Gospel. No argument can be pursued until we have _premised_ those points upon which both parties are to agree; we must be careful not to _presume_ upon more than what we are fully authorized to take for certain. 

####preparatory

####prepare

####preparedness 
**PREPAREDNESS, PREPARATION.**  
_Preparedness_ is a substantive developed recently in the United States from the past participle of the verb _prepare_, and means _prepared_ for war. It has in itself no other meaning than is implied in the substantive corresponding to _prepare_, already in existence — _i.e., preparation;_ but it derives its special significance and vogue from the agitation for increased armaments. It cannot be substituted for _preparation_ in other connections. _Preparation_ is the normal substantive corresponding to _prepare._  
Thus we _plan_ things ahead of the time when wanted or to be done; we _prearrange_ family matters before our death; we _precontrive_ or experiment with transactions before results are needed; we _predetermine_ or settle a problem or future action in our minds before it is necessary to _accomplish_ it; and we _propose_ something that may become a settled matter in the future.

####press 
**PRESS, SQUEEZE, PINCH, GRIPE.**  
_Press_, in Latin _pressus_, participle of _premere_, to press. _Squeeze_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _cwiesan_, to crush, with the addition of _es_, from the Old French prefix es (Latin _ex)_ which has a privative force. _Pinch_ is a nasalized form of Italian _picciare_ or _pizzare_, North French _pincher_, meaning to prick with a sharp-pointed instrument — a _pick_ or _pike;_ it is not now applied to a pricking, however. _Gripe_, a word now seldom used in this spelling, and generally substituted by the analogous _grip_, is in Anglo-Saxon _gripan._  
The forcible action of one body on another is included in all these terms. In the word press this is the only idea; the rest differ in the circumstances. We may _press_ with the foot, the hand, the whole body, or any particular limb; one _squeezes_ commonly with the hand; one _pinches_ either with the fingers or an instrument constructed in a similar form; one _gripes_ with teeth, claws, or any instrument that can gain a hold upon the object. Inanimate as well as animate objects _press_ or _pinch;_ but to _squeeze_ and _gripe_ are more properly the actions of animate objects; the former is always said of persons, the latter of animals; stones _press_ that on which they rest their weight; a door which shuts of itself may _pinch_ the fingers; one _squeezes_ the hand of a friend; lobsters and many other shell-fish _gripe_ whatever comes within their claws.  
In the figurative application they have a similar distinction; we _press_ a person, by importunity, to some coercive measure; an extortioner _squeezes_ in order to get that which is given with reluctance or difficulty; a miser _pinches_ himself if he contracts his subsistence; he _gripes_ (in modern parlance, _grips)_ all that comes within his possession.  
**PRESS, MASSAGE.** — _Massage_, from French _massage_, signifying kneading, ultimately from _massa_, dough, is a certain kind of pressing, technically defined as "motion with _pressure"_ used in the treatment of certain forms of physical illness and weakness. It is therefore a special and somewhat technical word corresponding to the general word _press._  
**PRESSING, URGENT, IMPORTUNATE.** — _Pressing_ and _urgent_, from to _press_ and _urge_, are applied as qualifying terms either to persons or things; _importunate_, from the verb to _importune_ (based on Late Latin _importunatus_, past participle of _importunari_, compounded of _in_, privative, and _partus_, port, no port, _i.e._, difficult of access), is applied only to persons. In regard to _pressing_, it is said either of one's demands, one's requests, or one's exhortations; _urgent_ is said of one's solicitations or entreaties; _importunate_ is said of one's begging or applying for a thing. The _pressing_ has more of violence in it; it is supported by force and authority; it is employed in matters of right: the _urgent_ makes an appeal to one's feelings; it is more persuasive, and is employed in matters of favor: the _importunate_ has some of the force, but none of the authority or obligation, of the _"pressing;_ it is employed in matters of personal gratification. When applied to things, _pressing_ is as much more forcible than _urgent_ as in the former case; we speak of a _pressing_ necessity, an _urgent_ case. A creditor will be _pressing_ for his money when he fears to lose it; one friend is _urgent_ with another to intercede in his behalf; beggars are commonly _importunate_ with the hope of teasing others out of their money. 

####presume 
See [premise](entry://premise)

####presumption 
See [arrogance](entry://arrogance); [assumption](entry://assumption)

####presumptive 
**PRESUMPTIVE, PRESUMPTUOUS, PRESUMING.**  
_Presumptive_ comes from _presume_, in the sense of supposing or taking for granted; _presumptuous, presuming_ (see [assumption](entry://assumption)), comes from the same verb in the sense of taking upon one's self, or taking to one's self, any importance: the former is therefore employed in an indifferent, the latter in a bad, acceptation: a _presumptive_ heir is one _presumed_ or expected to be heir; _presumptive_ evidence is evidence founded on some _presumption_ or supposition; so likewise _presumptive_ reasoning; but a _presumptuous_ man, a _presumptuous_ thought, or _presumptuous_ behavior, all indicate an unauthorized _presumption_ in one's own favor. _Presumptuous_ is a stronger term than _presuming_, because it has a more definite use; the former, from the termination _ous_, signifies full of _presumption;_ the latter the inclination to _presume:_ a man is _presumptuous_ when his conduct partakes of the nature of _presumption;_ he is _presuming_, inasmuch as he shows himself disposed to _presume:_ hence we speak of _presumptuous_ language, not _presuming_ language: a _presuming_ temper, not a _presumptuous_ temper. In like manner, when one says it is _presumptuous_ in a man to do anything, this expresses the idea of _presumption_ much more forcibly than to say it is _presuming_ in him to do it. It would be _presumptuous_ in a man to address a monarch in a language of familiarity and disrespect; it is _presuming_ in a common person to address any one who is superior in station with familiarity and disrespect. 

####pretence 
**PRETENCE, PRETENSION, PRETEXT, EXCUSE.**  
_Pretence_ comes from _pretend_ (see [feign](entry://feign)) in the sense of setting forth anything independent of ourselves. _Pretension_ comes from the same verb in the sense of setting forth anything that depends upon ourselves. The _pretence_ is commonly a misrepresentation; the _pretension_ is frequently a miscalculation: the _pretence_ is set forth to conceal what is bad in one's self; the _pretension_ is set forth to display what is good: the former betrays one's falsehood, the latter one's conceit or self-importance; the former can never be employed in a good sense, the latter may sometimes be employed in an indifferent sense: a man of bad character may make a _pretence_ of religion by adopting an outward profession; men of the least merit often display the highest _pretensions._  
The _pretence_ and _pretext_ alike consist of what is unreal; but the former is not so great a violation of truth as the latter: the _pretence_ may consist of truth and falsehood blended; the _pretext_ consists altogether of falsehood: the _pretence_ may sometimes serve only to conceal or palliate a fault; the _pretext_ serves to hide something seriously culpable or wicked: a child may make indisposition a _pretence_ for idleness; a thief makes his acquaintance with the servants a _pretext_ for getting admittance into a house.  
The _pretence_ and _excuse_ are both set forth to justify one's conduct in the eyes of others; but the _pretence_ always conceals something more or less culpable, and by a greater or less violation of truth; the _excuse_ may sometimes justify that which is justifiable, and with strict regard to truth. To oblige one's self under the _pretence_ of obliging another is a contemptible trick; _illness_ is an allowable _excuse_ to justify any omission in business. And even where the _excuse_ may be frivolous it does not imply direct falsehood.  
**PRETENSION, CLAIM** — _Pretension_ and _claim_ (see [ask](entry://ask)) both signify an assertion of rights, but they differ in the nature of the rights. The first refers only to the rights which are considered as such by the individual; the latter to those which exist independently of his supposition: there cannot, therefore, be a _pretension_ without some one to pretend, but there may be a _claim_ without any immediate _claimant:_ thus we say a person rests his _pretension_ to the crown upon the ground of being descended from the former king; in hereditary monarchies there is no one who has any _claim_ to the crown except the next heir in succession.  
The _pretension_ is commonly built upon personal merits; the _claim_ rests upon the laws of civil society: a person makes high _pretensions_ who estimates his merits and consequent deserts at a high rate; he judges of his _claims_ according as they are supported by the laws of his country or the circumstances of the case: the _pretension_ when denied can never be proved; the _claim_, when proved, can be enforced.

####prevailing 
**PREVAILING, PREVALENT, RULING, OVERRULING, PREDOMINANT.**  
_Prevailing_ and _prevalent_ both come from the Latin _prœvalere_, to be strong above others. _Ruling, overruling_, and _predominant_ (from _dominari_, itself derived from _dominus_, lord) signify _ruling_ or bearing greater sway than others.  
_Prevailing_ expresses the actual state or quality of a particular object: _prevalent_ marks the quality of _prevailing_, as it affects objects in general. The same distinction exists between _overruling_ and _predominant._ A person has a _prevailing_ sense of religion; religious feeling is _prevalent_ in a country or in a community. There is always some _prevailing_ fashion which some persons are ever ready to follow. The idea has of late years become _prevalent. Prevailing_ and _prevalent_ mark simply the existing state of superiority: _ruling_ and _predominant_ express this state in relation to some other which it has superseded or reduced to a state of inferiority. An opinion is said to be _prevailing_ as respects the number of persons by whom it is maintained: a principle is said to be _ruling_ as respects the superior influence which it has over the conduct of men more than any other. Particular disorders are _prevalent_ at certain seasons of the year, when they affect the generality of persons: a particular taste or fashion is _predominant_ which supersedes all other tastes or fashions.

####prevent 
**PREVENT, ANTICIPATE.**  
To _prevent_ is literally to come beforehand, from Latin _prœ_, before, and _venire_, to come; and _anticipate_ to take beforehand, from Latin _ante_, before, and a weakened form of the verb _capere_, to take. The former is employed for actual occurrences; the latter as much for calculations as for actions: to _prevent_ is the act of a person toward other persons or things', to _anticipate_ is the act of a being either toward himself or another. In this original and now obsolete sense God is said to _prevent_ man with His favor by interposing so as to direct his purposes to the right object.  
So also a man may _prevent_ what is to happen by causing it to happen before the time.  
We _anticipate_ the happiness which we are to enjoy in future; we _anticipate_ what a person is going to say by saying the same thing before him.  
_Prevent_, in its modern use, is always taken in the sense of causing a thing not to be done: _anticipate_ may also be so used, but with this distinction, that to _prevent_ is to cause a thing not to be done or happen at all, and _anticipate_ is to _prevent_ another from doing it by doing it one's self.  
**PREVENT, OBVIATE, PRECLUDE.** — All these terms imply the causing something not to take place or exist. To _prevent_ (see [hinder](entry://hinder)) is to cause something to happen before, so as to render another thing impracticable. To _obviate_, from _ob_, before, opposite, and _via_, way, signifies coming in the way so as to render the thing unnecessary or of no value. _Prevent_ applies to events or circumstances in life; _obviate_ to mental acts or objects: bad weather _prevents_ a person setting out according to a certain arrangement; a change of plan _obviates_ every difficulty.  
To _preclude_, from Latin _prœ_ and _cludere_, based on _claudere_, to shut, and signifying to shut out a possibility by the intervention of something else, is, like _obviate_, applied to mental objects.  
To _prevent_ and _preclude_ are rather the act of the thing than of the person; to _obviate_ is rather the act of the person than of the thing. Circumstances may _prevent_ or _preclude_ anything from happening: a person _obviates_ a difficulty or objection; so, according to this distinction, we may say either to _obviate_ a necessity or to _preclude_ a necessity for anything, according as this is effected by any person or by any circumstance. 

####previous 
**PREVIOUS, PRELIMINARY, PREPARATORY, INTRODUCTORY.**  
_Previous_, in Latin _prœvius_, compounded of _prœ_, before, and _via_, way, signifies leading the way or going before. _Preliminary_, from _prœ_ and _limen_, a threshold, signifies belonging to the threshold or entrance. _Preparatory_ and _introductory_ signify belonging to a preparation or introduction.  
_Previous_ denotes simply the order of succession: the other terms, in addition to this, convey the idea of connection between the objects which succeed each other. _Previous_ applies to actions and proceedings in general; as a _previous_ question, a _previous_ inquiry, a _previous_ determination: _preliminary_ is employed only for matters of contract: a _preliminary_ article, a _preliminary_ condition, are what precede the final settlement of any question: _preparatory_ is employed for matters of arrangement; the disposing of men in battle is _preparatory_ to an engagement; the making of marriage deeds and contracts is _preparatory_ to the final solemnization of the marriage: _introductory_ is employed for matters of science or discussion; as remarks are _introductory_ to the main subject in question: compendiums of grammar, geography, and the like, as _introductory_ to larger works, are useful to young people. Prudent people are careful to make every _previous_ inquiry before they seriously enter into engagements with strangers: it is impolitic to enter into details until all _preliminary_ matters are fully adjusted: one ought never to undertake any important matter without first adopting every _preparatory_ measure that can facilitate its prosecution: in complicated matters it is necessary to have something _introductory_ by way of explanation.

####pride 
**PRIDE, VANITY, CONCEIT.**  
_Pride_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _pryte_, from _prut_, proud, valiant, notable, which seems to be of French origin. It meant valiant, notable; hence a consciousness of being valiant and notable. _Vanity_, Latin _vanitas_, comes from _vanus_, empty, signifying a pride that has no basis in reality. _Conceit_ (see that word).  
The valuing of one's self for the possession of any property is the idea common to these terms, but they differ either in regard to the object or the manner of the action. _Pride_ is the term of most extensive import and application, and comprehends in its signification not only that of the other two terms, but likewise ideas peculiar to itself. _Pride_ is applicable to every object, good or bad, high or low, small or great; _vanity_ is applicable only to small objects: _pride_ is therefore good or bad: _vanity_ is always bad, it is always emptiness or nothingness. A man is _proud_ who values himself for his possession of literary or scientific talent, for his wealth, his rank, his power, his acquirements, or his superiority over his competitors; he is _vain_ of his person, his dress, his walk, or anything that is frivolous. _Pride_ is the inherent quality in man; and, while it rests on noble objects, it is his noblest characteristic; _vanity_ is the distortion of one's nature resulting from inherent tendency or an injudicious education: _pride_ shows itself variously, according to the nature of the object on which it is fixed; a noble _pride_ seeks to display itself in all that can command the respect or admiration of mankind; the _pride_ of wealth, of power, or of other adventitious properties, commonly displays itself in unseemly deportment toward others; _vanity_ shows itself in false pretensions.  
_Pride_, in the limited and bad sense, is always associated with strength and produces more or less violence; _vanity_ is coupled with weakness.  
_Conceit_ is that species of self-valuation that respects one's talents only; in so far, therefore, it is closely allied to _pride;_ a man is said to be _proud_ of that which he really has, but to be _conceited_ of that which he really has not: a man may be _proud_ to an excess of merits which he actually possesses; but when he is _conceited_, his merits are all in his own _conceit;_ the latter is therefore obviously founded on falsehood altogether. As _self-conceit is the_ offspring of ignorance and _vanity_, it is most frequently found in youth, but as it is the greatest obstacle to improvement, it may grow up with a person and go on with him through life.  
**PRIDE, HAUGHTINESS, LOFTINESS, DIGNITY.** — _Pride_ is employed principally as respects the temper of the mind: _haughtiness_ (see **haughty** under [haughtiness](entry://haughtiness)) and _loftiness_ (see [high](entry://high)) concerns either the temper of mind or the external behavior. _Dignity_ (see [honor](entry://honor)) only the external behavior. _Pride_ is, as before, the general term; the others are modes of _pride. Pride_, inasmuch as it consists purely of self-esteem, is a positive sentiment which one may entertain independently of other persons: it lies in the inmost recesses of the human heart, and mingles itself insensibly with our affections and passions. _Haughtiness_ is that mode of _pride_ which springs out of comparison of one's self with others; the _haughty_ man dwells on the inferiority of others; the _proud_ man, in the strict sense, dwells on his own perfections. _Loftiness_ is a mode of _pride_ which raises the spirit above objects supposed to be inferior; it does not set man so much above others as above himself, or that which concerns himself.  
As respects the exterior, _pride_ in the behavior is always bad. But it is taken in an indifferent sense in application to animals or unconscious agents.  
_Haughtiness_ in one's carriage, and _loftiness_ in one's tone or air, are mostly unbecoming and seldom warranted.  
_Dignity_, which arises from a proper consciousness of what is due to one's self, is always taken in a good sense. It is natural to some men, and shows itself at all times; on other occasions it requires to be assumed. 

####primary 
**PRIMARY, PRIMITIVE, PRISTINE, ORIGINAL.**  
_Primary_, from _primus_ and the suffix _arius_, signifies belonging to or like the first. _Primitive_, from the same ordinal, signifies being the first. _Pristine_, in Latin _pristinus_, from _prius_, signifies in former times. _Original_ signifies containing the _origin_, from the verb _oriri_, to rise or begin.  
The _primary_ denotes simply the order of succession, and is therefore the generic term; _primitive, pristine_, and _original_ include also the idea of some other relation to the thing that succeeds, and are therefore modes of the _primary._ The _primary_ has nothing to come before it; in this manner we speak of the _primary_ cause as the cause which precedes secondary causes: the _primitive_ is that after which other things are formed; in this manner a _primitive_ word is that after which, or from which, the derivatives are formed: the _pristine_ is that which follows the _primitive_, so as to become customary; there are but few specimens of the _pristine_ purity of life among the professors of Christianity: the _original_ is that which either gives birth to the thing or belongs to that which gives birth to the thing; the _original_ meaning of a word is that which was given to it by the makers of the word.

####prince 
**PRINCE, MONARCH, SOVEREIGN, POTENTATE.**  
_Prince_, in French _prince_, Latin _princeps_, from _primus_ and _capere_, to take, signifies the man who takes the first place. _Monarch_, from Latin _monarcha_ (built on Greek _μονάρχης_, from _μόνος_, alone, and _άρχειν_, to rule), signifies one having sole authority. _Potentate_, from _potens_, powerful, signifies one having supreme power. _Sovereign_ is derived from Latin _superanus. Prince_ is the generic term, the rest are specific terms; every _monarch, sovereign_, and _potentate_ is a _prince_, but not _vice versa._ The term _prince_ is indefinite as to the degree of power: a _prince_ may have a limited or despotic power; but in its restricted sense it denotes a smaller degree of power than any of the other terms: the term _monarch_ does not define the extent of the power, but simply that it is undivided, as opposed to that species of power which is lodged in the hands of many: _sovereign_ and _potentate_ indicate the highest degree of power; but the former is employed only as respects the nation that is governed, the latter in respect to other nations: a _sovereign_ is supreme over his subjects; a _potentate_ is powerful by means of his subjects. Every man having independent power is a _prince_, let his territory be ever so inconsiderable: Germany was divided into a number of small states, governed by their petty _princes._ Every one reigning by himself in a state of some considerable magnitude, and having independent authority over his subjects, is a _monarch_; kings and emperors, therefore, are all _monarchs._ Every _monarch_ is a _sovereign_ whose extent of dominion and number of subjects rises above the ordinary level; he is a _potentate_ if his influence either in the cabinet or in the field extends very considerably over the affairs of other nations.

####principle 
**PRINCIPLE, MOTIVE.**  
The _principle_ (see [doctrine](entry://doctrine)) may sometimes be the _motive;_ but often there is a _principle_ where there is no _motive_, and there is a _motive_ where there is no _principle._ The _principle_ lies in conscious and unconscious agents; the _motive_ only in conscious agents; all nature is guided by certain _principles;_ its movements go forward upon certain _principles:_ man is put into action by certain _motives;_ the _principle_ is the prime _moving_ cause of everything that is set in motion; the _motive_ is the prime _moving_ cause that sets the human machine into action. The _principle_ in its restricted sense comes still nearer to the _motive_, when it refers to the opinions which we form: the _principle_ in this case is that idea which we form of things so as to regulate our conduct; the _motive_ is that idea which simply impels to action: the former is therefore something permanent, and grounded upon the exercise of our reasoning powers; the latter is momentary and arises simply from our capacity of willing and thinking: bad _principles_ lead a man into a bad course of life; but a man may be led by bad _motives_ to do what is good as well as what is bad.

####priority 
**PRIORITY, PRECEDENCE, PRE-EMINENCE, PREFERENCE.**  
_Priority_ denotes the abstract quality of being before others: _precedence_, from _prœ_, before, and _cedere_, to go, signifies the act of going before: _pre-eminence_ signifies being more eminent or elevated than others: _preference_ signifies being put before others. _Priority_ implies simply the order of succession, and is applied to objects either in a state of motion or rest; _precedence_ signifies _priority_ in going, and depends upon a right or privilege; _pre-eminence_ signifies _priority_ in being, and depends upon merit; _preference_ signifies _priority_ in placing, and depends upon favor. The _priority_ is applicable rather to the thing than the person; it is not that which is sought for, but that which is to be had: age frequently gives _priority_ where every other claim is wanting. The immoderate desire for _precedence_ is often nothing but a childish vanity; it is a distinction that results from rank and power; a nobleman claims a _precedence_ on all occasions of ceremony. The love of _pre-eminence_ is laudable inasmuch as it requires a degree of moral worth which exceeds that of others; a general aims at _pre-eminence_ in his profession. Those who are anxious to obtain the best for themselves are eager to have the _preference:_ we seek for the _preference_ in matters of choice. 

####pristine 
See [primary](entry://primary)

####privacy 
**PRIVACY, RETIREMENT, SECLUSION.**  
_Privacy_ literally denotes the abstract quality of _private_ (from the Latin adjective _privatus_, based on _privare);_ but when taken by itself it signifies the state of being _private: retirement_ literally signifies the abstract act of _retiring:_ and _seclusion_ that of _secluding_ one's self: but _retirement_ by itself frequently denotes a state of being retired or a place of _retirement; seclusion_, a state of being _secluded:_ hence we say a person lives in _privacy_, in _retirement_, in _seclusion: privacy_ is opposed to publicity; he who lives in _privacy_, therefore, is one who follows no public line, who lives so as to be little known: _retirement_ is opposed to openness or freedom of access; he, therefore, who lives in _retirement_ withdraws from the society of others, he lives by himself: _seclusion_ is the excess of _retirement;_ he who lives in _seclusion_ bars all access to himself; he shuts himself from the world. _Privacy_ is most suitable for such as are in circumstances of humiliation, whether from their misfortune or their fault; _retirement_ is peculiarly agreeable to those who are of a reflective turn, but _seclusion_ is chosen only by those who labor under some strong affection of the mind, whether of a religious or a physical nature.

####privilege 
**PRIVILEGE, PREROGATIVE, EXEMPTION, IMMUNITY.**  
_Privilege_, in Latin _privilegium_, compounded of _privus_ and _lex_, signifies a law made for any individual or set of individuals. _Prerogative_, from Latin _prœrogativa (sc., tribus_ or _centuria)_, based on _prœ_, before, and _rogare_, to ask, was applied to the tribe or century to whom it fell by lot to vote first in the _Comitia_, which was _asked first_ whom it would have for consul: hence applied in our language to the right of determining or choosing first in many particulars. _Exemption_, from the verb to _exempt_, and _immunity_, from the Latin _immunis_, free of public service, from _in_, not, and _munis_, not ready to serve, based on _munus_, a public office, are both employed for the object from which one is _exempt_ or free.  
_Privilege_ and _prerogative_ consist of positive advantages; _exemption_ and _immunity_ of those which are negative: by the former we obtain an actual good, by the latter the removal of an evil. _Privilege_, in its most extended sense, comprehends all the rest: for _prerogative, exemption_, and _immunity_ are _privileges_, inasmuch as they rest upon certain laws or customs which are made for the benefit of certain individuals. In the restricted sense, the _privilege_ may be enjoyed by many; the _prerogative_, which is a peculiar and distinguished _privilege_, can be enjoyed only by a few. As they concern the public, _privileges_ belong to the subject or are granted to him; _prerogatives_ belong to the crown. It is the _privilege_ of a member of Parliament to escape arrest for debt; it is the _prerogative_ of the crown to be irresponsible for the conduct of its ministers; as respects private cases, it is the _privilege_ of women to have the best places assigned to them; it is the _prerogative_ of the man to address the woman.  
_Privileges_ are applied to every object which it is desirable to have; _prerogative_ is confined to the case of making one's election or exercising any special power; _exemption_ is applicable to cases in which one is exempted from any tribute or payment; _immunity_, because of its derivation above explained, is peculiarly applicable to cases in which one is freed from a service: all chartered towns or corporations have _privileges, exemptions_, and _immunities:_ it is the _privilege_ of the city of London to shut its gates against the king.

####proceeding 
**PROCEEDING, PROCESS, PROGRESS.**  
The first two of these words are based on Latin _pro_, forward, and the verb _cedere_, in the sense of go; the last on _progredior_, to advance. The manner of performing actions for the attainment of a given end is the common idea comprehended in these terms. _Proceeding_ is the most general, as it simply expresses the general idea of the manner of going on; the rest are specific terms, denoting some particularity in the action, object, or circumstance. _Proceeding_ is said commonly of such things as happen in the ordinary way of doing business; _process_ is said of such things as are done by rule: the former is considered from a moral point of view; the latter from a scientific or technical standpoint: Freemasons have bound themselves by a law of secrecy not to reveal any part of their _proceedings;_ the _process_ by which paper is made has undergone considerable improvements since its first invention.  
_Proceeding_ and _progress_ both refer to the moral actions of men; but the _proceeding_ simply denotes the act of going on or doing something; the _progress_ denotes an approximation to the end: the _proceeding_ may be only a partial action comprehending both the beginning and the end; but the _progress_ is applied to that which requires time and a regular succession of action to bring it to completion: that is a _proceeding_ in which every man is tried in a court of law; that is a _progress_ which one makes in learning, by the addition to one's knowledge: hence we do not talk of the _proceeding_ of life, but of the _progress_ of life.  
**PROCEEDING, TRANSACTION.** — _Proceeding_ signifies, literally, the thing that _proceeds;_ and _transaction_ the thing _transacted:_ the former, therefore, is used of something that is going forward; the latter of something that is already done: we are witnesses to the whole _proceeding;_ we inquire into the whole _transaction._ The term _proceeding_ is said of every event or circumstance which goes forward through the agency of men; _transaction_ comprehends only those matters which have been deliberately _transacted_ or brought to a conclusion: in this sense we use the word _proceeding_ in application to a disturbance in the street, and the word _transaction_ to some commercial negotiation that has been carried on between certain persons. The term _proceeding_ marks the manner of _proceeding;_ as when we speak of the _proceedings_ in a court of law: _transaction_ marks the business _transacted;_ as the _transactions_ on the Exchange. A _proceeding_ may be characterized as disgraceful; a _transaction_ as iniquitous.  
**PROCESSION, TRAIN, RETINUE.** — _Procession_, from the verb _proceed_, signifies the act of going forward or before, that is, in the present instance, of going before others, or one before another. _Train_, from Old French _train_, Low Latin _trahinare_, a derivative of classical _trahere_, to draw, signifies the thing drawn after another, as in the modern _train_, a succession of cars; and in the present instance the persons who are led after, or follow, any object. _Retinue_, from French _retenue_, past participle of _retenir_ (from Latin _re_ and _tenere_, to hold back, retain), signifies those who are retained as attendants.  
All these terms are said of any number of persons who follow in a certain order; but this, which is the leading idea in the word _procession_, is but collateral in the terms _train_ and _retinue:_ on the other hand, the _procession_ may consist of persons of all ranks and stations; but _train_ and _retinue_ apply only to such as follow some person or thing in a subordinate capacity: the former in regard to such as make up the concluding part of some _procession,_ the latter only in regard to the servants or attendants on the great. At funerals there is frequently a long _train_ of coaches belonging to the friends of the deceased, which close the _procession;_ princes and nobles never go out on state or public occasions without a numerous _retinue:_ the beauty of every _procession_ consists in the order with which every one keeps his place and the regularity with which the whole goes forward; the length of a _train_ is what renders it most worthy of notice; the number of a _retinue_ in eastern nations is one criterion by which the wealth of the individual is estimated.

####production 
**PRODUCTION, PRODUCE, PRODUCT.**  
The term _production_ expresses either the act of _producing_ or the thing _produced; product_ and _produce_ express only the thing _produced:_ the _production_ of a tree from a seed is one of the wonders of nature; the _product_ will not be considerable. In the sense of the thing _produced, production_ is applied to every individual thing that is _produced_, whether by nature or art, as a tree is a _production_ or a painting is a _production_ of art or skill: _produce_ and _product_ are properly applicable to those _productions_ of nature which are made to turn to account; the former in a collective sense, and in reference to some particular object, the latter in an abstract and general sense: the aggregate quantity of grain drawn from a field is termed the _produce_ of the field; but corn, hay, vegetables, and fruits in general are termed _products_ of the earth: the naturalist examines all the _productions_ of nature; the husbandman looks to the _produce_ of his lands; the topographer and traveller inquire about the _products_ of different countries.  
There is the same distinction between these terms in their improper as in their proper acceptation; the _production_ is whatever results from an effort, physical or mental, as a _production_ of genius, a _production_ of art, and the like; the _produce_ is the aggregate result from physical or mental labor: thus, whatever the husbandman reaps from the cultivation of his land is termed the _produce_ of his labor; whatever results from any public subscription or collection is, in like manner, the _produce:_ the _product_ is employed properly in regard to the mental operation of figures, as the _product_ from multiplication, but may be extended to anything which is the fruit of the brain.  
**PRODUCTION, PERFORMANCE, WORK.** — When we speak of anything as resulting from any specified operation, we term it a _production:_ as the _production_ of an author, signifying what he has _produced_ by the effort of his mind: Homer's Iliad is esteemed as one of the finest _productions_ of the imagination. When we speak of anything as executed or _performed_ by some person, we term it a _performance_, as a drawing or a painting is denominated the _performance_ of a particular artist. The term _production_ cannot be employed without specifying or referring to the source from which it is _produced_ or the means by which it is _produced;_ as the _production_ of art, the _production_ of the inventive faculty, the _production_ of the mind, etc.: but a _performance_ may be spoken of without referring to the individual by whom it has been _performed;_ hence we speak of this or that person's _performance;_ but we may also say, a good _performance._ When we wish to specify anything that results from _work_ or labor, it is termed a _work:_ in this manner we speak either of the _work_ of one's hands or of a _work_ of the imagination, a _work_ of time, a _work_ of magnitude.

####profess 
**PROFESS, DECLARE.**  
_Profess_, in Latin _professus_, participle of _profiteor_, compounded of _pro_ and _fateri_, to speak, signifies to set forth or present to public view. _Declare_ (see that word).  
An exposition of one's thoughts or opinions is the common idea in the signification of these terms; but they differ in the manner of the action, as well as in the object: one _professes_ by words or by actions; one _declares_ by words only: a man _professes_ to believe that on which he acts; but he _declares_ his belief in it either with his lips or in his writings. A _profession_ may be general and partial; it may amount to little more than an intimation: a _declaration_ is positive and explicit; it leaves no one in doubt: a _profession_ may, therefore, sometimes be hypocritical; he who _professes_ may wish to imply that which is untrue: a _declaration_ must be either directly true or false; he who _declares_ expressly commits himself upon his veracity. One _professes_ either as respects single actions or a regular course of conduct; one _declares_ either passing thoughts or settled principles. A person _professes_ to have walked to a certain distance, to have taken a certain route, and the like: a Christian _professes_ to follow the doctrine and precepts of Christianity; a person _declares_ that a thing is true or false, or he _declares_ his firm belief in a thing.  
To _profess_ is employed only for what concerns one's self; to _declare_ is also employed for what concerns others: one _professes_ the motives and principles by which one is guided: one _declares_ facts and circumstances with which one is acquainted: one _professes_ nothing but what one thinks may be creditable and fit to be known; but one _declares_ whatever may have fallen under one's notice or passed through one's mind, as the case requires; there is always a particular and private motive for _profession;_ there are frequently public grounds for making a _declaration._

####profligate 
**PROFLIGATE, ABANDONED, REPROBATE**.  
These words have all a close connection. _Profligate_, in Latin _proftigatus_, participle of _proftigo_, compounded of the prefix _pro_, forward, down, and _ftigare_, to dash, signifies properly one dashed down and destroyed; hence, by extension, wretched and then vile, used as a term of extreme reproach: so Cicero called Catiline "most _profligate_ and abandoned of all mortals. " _Abandoned_ (see [abandon](entry://abandon)). _Reprobate_ (see [reprove](entry://reprove)) signifies one thoroughly hardened to reproof.  
A _profligate_ man is one completely overcome and ruined by his vices: an _abandoned_ man is one _abandoned_ to his passions: the _reprobate_ man is one who has been reproved until he becomes insensible to reproof and cannot be diverted from following his evil course.

####profusion 
**PROFUSION, PROFUSENESS.**  
_Profusion_, from the Latin _profundo_, to pour forth, is taken in relation to unconscious objects, which pour forth in great plenty; _profuseness_ is taken from the same, in relation to conscious agents, who likewise pour forth in great plenty: the term _profusion_, therefore, is put for plenty itself, and the term _profuseness_ as a characteristic of persons in the sense of extravagance. At the hospitable board of the rich there will naturally be a _profusion_ of everything which can gratify the appetite; when men see an unusual degree of _profusion_, they are apt to indulge themselves in _profuseness._

####progress 
**PROGRESS, PROGRESSION, ADVANCEMENT.**  
A forward motion is designated by these terms: but _progress_ and _progression_ simply imply this sort of motion; _advance_ and _advancement_ also imply an approximation to some object: we may make _progress_ in that which has no specific termination, as _progress_ in learning, which may cease only with life; but the _ad-van ce_ is made only to some limited point or object in view; as an _advance_ in wealth or honor, which may find a termination within the. lifetime. _Progress_ and _advance_ are said of that which has been attained; but _progression_ and _advancement_ may be said of that which one is attaining: the _progress_ or the _advance_ has been made, or the person is in the act of _progression_ or _advancement:_ a child makes _progress_ in learning by daily attention; the _progression_ from one stage of learning to another is not always perceptible; it is not always possible to overtake one who is in _advance;_ sometimes a person's _advancement_ is retarded by circumstances that are altogether contingent: the first step in any destructive course prepares for the second, and the second for the third, after which there is no stop, but the _progress_ is infinite.  
See also [proceeding](entry://proceeding)  
**PROGRESS, PROFICIENCY, IMPROVEMENT.** — _Progress_ is a generic term, the rest are specific; _proficiency_, from the Latin _proficio_, compounded of _pro_, forward, and a weakened form of _facere_, to do, signifies a state of _progression_ — that is to say, a _progress_ already made; and _improvement_, from the verb _improve_ (see [amend](entry://amend)), signifies an improved condition — that is, _progress_ in that which _improves._ The term _progress_ here, as in the former paragraph, marks the step or motion onward, and the two others the point already reached: but _progress_ is applied either in the proper or improper sense: that is, either to those travelling forward or to those going on stepwise in any work; _proficiency_ is applied, in the improper sense, to the ground gained in an art, and _improvement_ to what is gained in knowledge, or understanding, or abilities; when idle people set about any work it is difficult to perceive that they make any _progress_ in it from time to time; those who have a thorough taste for either music or drawing will show a _proficiency_ in it which is astonishing to those who are unacquainted with the circumstances; the _improvement_ of the mind can never be so effectually and easily obtained as in the period of childhood.  
_Progress_ and _proficiency_ are applied to the acts of persons, but _improvement_ denotes also the act or state of things; one must make _progress_ or show _proficiency_, but things admit of _improve-_

####proletariat 
**PROLETARIAT, THE MASSES, HOI POLLOI.**  
_Proletariat_, from Latin _proletarius_, one who helped the state by his children only (from _proles_, offspring), is a word which has come into general usage as a result of the popular interest in political economy during the later nineteenth century. It refers to the lowest class in an organized society, the laborers who have no capital and are dependent on the work of their hands from day to day for subsistence. The term _the masses_ (from _mass_, a lump of unorganized, unmolded matter, from Greek _μάσσειν_, to knead — that which may be or should be kneaded) is also a comparatively recent phrase. It has the same meaning as _proletariat_, but a slightly different meaning, emphasizing not the existence of the lower order, as a distinct order, but as a great multitude outside of the distinct classes. Having been used somewhat contemptuously, it has been adopted as a name of honor by some of the leaders among "the masses, " as the title of one of their organs in America, _The Masses_, shows. _Hoi polloi_ is the Greek phrase _οί πολλοί_, transliterated with Roman letters. It means, literally, "the many, " and among the Greeks was opposed to "the few, " as "the masses" were opposed by Gladstone to "the classes. It has much the same connotations as _the masses_, but is generally used in a somewhat flippant and frivolous tone, whereas the phrase _the masses_ is becoming a word to conjure with, to be uttered in all seriousness.

####prominent 
**PROMINENT, CONSPICUOUS.**  
_Prominent_ signifies hanging over; _conspicuous_ (see **distinguished** under [distinguish](entry://distinguish)) signifies easy to be beheld: the former is, therefore, to the latter, in some measure, as the species to the genus; what is _prominent_ is, in general, on that very account _conspicuous;_ but many things may be _conspicuous_ which are not expressly _prominent:_ nothing is _prominent_ but what _projects_ beyond a certain line; everything is _conspicuous_ which may be seen by many: the nose on a man's face is a _prominent_ feature, owing to its projecting situation; and it is sometimes _conspicuous_, according to the position of the person: a figure in a _painting_ is said to be _prominent_ if it appears to stand forward or before the others; but it is not properly _conspicuous_ unless there be something in it which attracts the general notice and distinguishes it from all other things; on the contrary, it is _conspicuous_, but not expressly _prominent_, when the colors are vivid. 

####promiscuous 
**PROMISCUOUS, INDISCRIMINATE.**  
_Promiscuous_, in Latin _promiscuus_, compounded of the prefix _pro_ and _miscere_, to mingle, signifies thoroughly mingled. _Indiscriminate_, from the Latin _in_, privative, and _discrimen_, a difference, signifies without any difference.  
_Promiscuous_ is applied to any number of different objects mingled together; _indiscriminate_ is applied only to the action in which one does not discriminate different objects: a multitude is termed _promiscuous_, as characterizing the thing; the use of different things for the same purpose, or of the same things for different purposes is termed _indiscriminate_, as characterizing the person: things become _promiscuous_ by the want of design in any one; they are _indiscriminate_ by the express intention of some one: plants of all descriptions are to be found _promiscuously_ situated in the beds of a garden: it is folly to level any charge _indiscriminately_ against all the members of any community or profession. 

####promise 
**PROMISE, ENGAGEMENT, WORD.**  
_Promise_, in Latin _promissus_, from _promitto_, compounded of _pro_, before, and the past participle of _mittere_, to send; that is, in this application, to pledge beforehand, is specific, and consequently more binding than the _engagement_ (see [business](entry://business)): we _promise_ a thing in a set form of words that are clearly and strictly understood; we _engage_ in general terms that may admit of alteration: a _promise_ is mostly unconditional; an _engagement_ is frequently conditional. In _promises_ the faith of an individual is accepted upon his word and relied upon as if it were a deed: in _engagements_ the intentions of an individual for the future are all that are either implied or understood: on the fulfilment of _promises_ often depend the most important interests of individuals; an attention to _engagements_ is a matter of mutual conven- ience in the ordinary concerns of life: a man makes a _promise_ of payment, and upon his _promise_ it may happen that many others depend for the fulfilment of their _promises:_ when _engagements_ are made to visit or meet others, the failure to observe such _engagements_ causes great trouble.  
As a _promise_ and _engagement_ can be made only by _words_, the _word_ is often put for either, or for both, as the case requires: he who breaks his _word_ in small matters cannot be trusted when he gives his _word_ in matters of consequence.

####proof 
**PROOF, EVIDENCE, TESTIMONY.**  
The _proof_ (see **argument** under [argue](entry://argue)) is that which simply _proves;_ the _evidence_ is that which makes _evident_ (see [clear](entry://clear)); the _testimony_, from _testis_, a witness, is a species of _evidence_ by means of witnesses. In the legal acceptation of the terms _proofs_ are commonly denominated _evidence_, because nothing can be admitted as _proof_ which does not tend to make _evident;_ but as what is _proved_ is made more certain or indubitable than what is made _evident, proof_ is more than _evidence. Proof_ is likewise taken for the act of _proving_ as well as for the thing that _proves_, which distinguishes it still further from _evidence. Evidence_ comprehends whatever is employed to make _evident_, be it words or deeds, be it writing or discourse; _testimony_ is properly _evidence_ by words spoken, and more strictly understood by the person giving the _evidence._  
In an extended application of these terms they are employed with a similar distinction: the _proof_ is the mark or sign which _proves:_ the _evidence_ is the mark or sign which makes _evident:_ the _testimony_ is that which is offered or given by things personified in _proof_ of anything.  
The _proof_ is employed for facts or physical objects: the _evidence_ is applied to that which is moral; _testimony_ regards that which is personal. All that our Saviour did and said were _evidences_ of his divine character, which might have produced faith in the minds of many, even if they had not had such numerous and miraculous _proofs_ of his power. One friend makes a present to another in _testimony_ of his regard: the _proof_ and the _testimony_ are something external, or some outward mark or indication; the _evidence_ may be internal or lie in the thing itself, as the internal _evidences_ of Christianity.

####proportionate 
**PROPORTIONATE, COMMENSURATE, ADEQUATE.**  
_Proportion_, front the Latin _proportio_, compounded of _pro_, suitable to, in ratio with, and _portio_, a share, signifies having a _portion_, suitable to, or in agreement with, some other object. _Commensurate_, from the Latin prefix _com_, based on _cum_, with, and _mensuratus_, the past participle of the post-classical _mensurare_, to measure, I measure, signifies measuring in accordance with some other thing, being suitable in measure to something else. _Adequate_, in Latin _adœquatus_, participle of _adœquare_, from _ad_, to, and _œquus_, equal, signifies made level with some other body.  
_Proportionate_ is here a term of general use; the others are particular terms, employed in a similar sense, in regard to particular objects: that is _proportionate_ which rises as a thing rises and falls as a thing falls; that is _commensurate_ which is made to rise to the same measure or degree; that is _adequate_ which is made to come up to the height of another thing. _Proportionate_ is employed either in the proper or improper sense; in recipes and prescriptions of every kind _proportionate_ quantities must always be taken; when the task increases in difficulty and complication, a _proportionate_ degree of labor and talent must be employed upon it. _Commensurate_ and _adequate_ are employed only in the moral sense, the former to denote suitability of things in point of measure, the latter to denote the equalizing of powers: a person's recompense should in some measure be _commensurate_ with his labor and deserts: a person's resources should be _adequate_ to the work he is engaged in. 

####proposal 
**PROPOSAL, PROPOSITION.**  
_Proposal_ comes from _propose_, based on Latin _pro_ and _ponere_, meaning to put forward, in the sense of offer: _proposition_ comes from _propose_, in the sense of setting down in a distinct form of words. We make a _proposal_ to a person to enter into a partnership with him; we make a _proposition_ to one who is at variance with us to settle the difference by arbitration.

####prorogue 
**PROROGUE, ADJOURN.**  
_Prorogue_, from the Latin _prorogare_, from _pro_, publicly, and _rogare_, to ask, means to propose an extension of office, to defer. _Adjourn_, from _ad_, to or until, and the French _journée_, the day, signifies only to put off for a day, or some short period: the former is applied to national assemblies only, the latter is applied to any meeting. 

####proscribe 
**PROSCRIBE, BANISH, CONDEMN, DENOUNCE, EXILE, EXPEL, OSTRACIZE, REJECT.**  
_Proscribe_, in Latin _proscribere_, from _pro_, before, openly, and _scribere_, to write, is virtually to put beyond the protection of the law by a written order. _Banish, expel_, and _exile_ are Closely allied applications signifying the act of driving or forcing a person from his country as a punishment by authority. _Condemn_ is to censure, blame, declare to be forfeited, pronounce or judge guilty. _Denounce_ is to threaten or accuse publicly; in diplomacy it is the act of abrogating a treaty. _Ostracize_ meant originally to banish by a vote written on a potsherd, from Greek _όστρακίζειν_, to banish by potsherds, based on _όστρακον_, a potsherd, a tablet for voting, allied with _oyster_, which originally signified a shell. _Ostracize_ differs from _proscribe, banish_, etc., in indicating a cutting off of the victim from social intercourse by a general, but often informal, withdrawing of favor on the part of a whole group or community. _Reject_ is to discard, cast aside, all of which is applicable alike to persons and things.  
In old Roman history, to _proscribe_ a person was to publish his name as one doomed to death and forfeiture of property; in ancient Athens to _banish_ a citizen was to throw a shell, inscribed with the name of the person, into an urn.

####protest 
**PROTEST, EXPOSTULATE, REMONSTRATE.**  
These words all indicate the statement of an objection on the part of some one to the acts or statements of another. _Protest_, from Latin _pro_, publicly, and _testor_, I bear witness, is a more solemn and formal act than _expostulate_ and _remonstrate._ In business, for instance, a _protest_ is a formal declaration by the holder of a bill of exchange of its non-payment or non-acceptance. _Remonstrate_, from Latin _re_, against, and _monstrare_, to show, is a mild form of protest in which the protesting party brings up arguments against a proposed course. To _expostulate_ is a friendly form of _remonstrating._

####prove 
**PROVE, DEMONSTRATE, EVINCE, MANIFEST.**  
_Prove_, in Latin _probare_, signifies to make good, _i.e._, to make good by proofs, which is here the general term; the other terms imply different modes of _proving:_ we _prove_ in different ways and in different degrees. To _demonstrate_, from _monstrare_, to show, and the intensive syllable _de_, signifies to _prove_ in a specific manner, that is, in a clear and undeniable manner; we may _prove_ facts, innocence, guilt, and the like; we _demonstrate_ the truth or falsity of a thing.  
_Prove_ and _demonstrate_ may also be applied to that which a person may show of himself; _evince_ (which is of less frequent use) and _manifest_ are used only in this application. To _prove_ in this case is to give a proof, as to _prove_ one's valor; to _demonstrate_ is to give a clear or ocular proof, as to _demonstrate_ an attachment to a thing; to _evince_ is to show by convincing proof, as to _evince_ one's integrity by the whole course of one's dealings; to _manifest_ is to make manifest, as to _manifest_ one's displeasure or satisfaction.  
In regard to things, to _prove_ is to serve as a proof; to _evince_ is to serve as a particular proof; to _manifest_ is to serve as a public proof. The beauty and order in the Creation _prove_ the wisdom of the Creator; a persistence in a particular course of conduct may _evince_, either great virtue or great folly; the miracles wrought in Egypt _manifested_ the Divine power. 

####proverb 
See [axiom](entry://axiom)

####provide 
**PROVIDE, PROCURE, FURNISH, SUPPLY.**  
_Provide_, in Latin _providere, i.e._, to foresee, signifies, literally, to see before, but, figuratively, to get in readiness for some future purpose. _Procure_ (see [get](entry://get)). _Furnish_ is in French _fournir_, from Old High German _frumjan_, to provide. _Supply_, in French _suppléer_, from Latin _sub_, up, and _plere_, to fill, signifies to fill up a deficiency or make up what is wanting.  
_Provide_ and _procure_ are both actions that have a special reference to the future; _furnish_ and _supply_ are employed for that which is of immediate concern: one _provides_ a dinner in the expectation that some persons are coming to partake of it; one _procures_ help in the expectation that it may be wanted; we _furnish_ a room as we find it necessary for the present purpose; one _supplies_ a family with any article of domestic use. Calculation is necessary in _providing;_ one does not wish to _provide_ too much or too little: labor and management are requisite in _procuring;_ when a thing is not always at hand, or not easily obtained, one must exercise one's time, strength, or ingenuity to _procure_ it: judgment is requisite in _furnishing;_ what one _furnishes_ ought to be selected with reference to the circumstances of the individual who _furnishes;_ care and attention are required in _supplying;_ we must be careful to know what a person really wants in order to _supply_ him to his satisfaction. One _provides_ against all contingencies; one _procures_ all necessaries; one _furnishes_ all comforts; one _supplies_ all deficiencies.  
_Provide_ and _procure_ are the acts of persons only; _furnish_ and _supply_ are the acts of unconscious agents: one's garden and orchard may be said to _furnish_ one with delicacies; the earth _supplies_ us with food. So in the improper application: the daily occurrences of a great city _furnish_ materials for a newspaper; a newspaper, to many people, _supplies_ almost every other want.  
**PROVIDENCE, PRUDENCE.** — _Providence_ and _prudence_ are both derived from the verb to _provide;_ but the former expresses the particular act of providing, the latter the habit of providing. The former is applied both to animals and men; the latter is employed only as a characteristic of men. We may admire the _providence_ of the ant in laying up a store for the winter; the _prudence_ of a parent is displayed in his concern for the future settlement of his child. It is _provident_ in a person to adopt measures of escape for himself in certain situations of peculiar danger; it is _prudent_ to be always prepared for all contingencies.  
**PRUDENT, PRUDENTIAL.** — _Prudent_ (see **judgment** under [judge](entry://judge)) characterizes the person or the thing; _prudential_ characterizes only the thing. _Prudent_ signifies having _prudence; prudential_, that which accords with rules of _prudence_ or as respects _prudence._ The _prudent_ is opposed to the _imprudent_ and inconsiderate; the _prudential_ is opposed to the voluntary: the course is _prudent_ which accords with the principles of _prudence;_ the reason or motive is _prudential_ as flowing out of circumstances of _prudence_ or necessity. Every one is called upon at certain times to adopt _prudent_ measures; those who are obliged to consult their means in the management of their expenses must act upon _prudential_ motives.

####provisional 
**PROVISIONAL, CONDITIONAL, CONTINGENT, HYPOTHETICAL.**  
The adjective _provisional_ is derived from the Latin _provisio_, foresight, and implies the act of providing beforehand, previous preparation, temporary arrangement. _Conditional_ signifies within certain limits, prescribed. _Contingent_, as an adjective, signifies accidental, also partial, as a lawyer's _contingent_ fee; as a substantive, a possibility, a quota of troops. _Hypothetical_ implies that which, is a supposition or conjecture, something assumed in an argument.

####pry 
**PRY, SCRUTINIZE, DELVE INTO.**  
_Pry_ is in all probability changed from _prove_, in the sense of try. _Scrutinize_ comes from the Latin _scruta_, broken pieces, and signifies to search carefully as if among rubbish or broken pieces.  
_Pry_ is taken in the bad sense of looking more narrowly into things than one ought: _scrutinize_ and _delve into_ are employed in the good sense of searching things to the bottom. A person who _pries_ looks into that which does not belong to him, and too narrowly also into that which may belong to him; it is the consequence of a too eager curiosity or a busy, meddling temper: a person who _scrutinizes_ looks into that which is intentionally concealed from him; it is an act of duty flowing out of his office: a person who _delves_ penetrates into that which lies hidden very deep; he is impelled to this action by the thirst of knowledge and a laudable curiosity.  
A love of _prying_ into the private affairs of families makes a person a troublesome neighbor; it is the business of the magistrate to _scrutinize_ all matters which affect the good order of society: there are some minds so imbued with a love of science that they delight to _delve into_ the secrets of nature. 

####public 
**PUBLIC, COMMUNITY, PEOPLE, SOCIETY, WORLD.**  
In these applications the term _public_ is usually preceded by the article _the_, and implies personality. The _community_ is a body of citizens embraced in a region of any size. _People_ are persons generally, inhabitants, race, kindred, family. _Society_ is a collection or union of people having a common interest, often applied to the more cultivated portion of a community in its social relations. The _world_ includes all people on earth, in the universe; sometimes applied to a personal environment, as _the world about us_, or to special bodies of people, as _the world of finance._

####publish 
**PUBLISH, PROMULGATE, DIVULGE, REVEAL, DISCLOSE.**  
_Publish_ (see [advertise](entry://advertise)). _Promulgate_, from Latin _promulgare_, to make known, is a word of unknown origin. _Divulge_, in Latin _divulgare_, from _di_, for _dis_, apart, and _vulgare_, based on _vulgus_, people, signifies to make known among the people. _Reveal_, in Latin _revelare_, from _veli_, veil, signifies to take off the veil or cover. _Disclose_ signifies to make the reverse of _closed._  
To _publish_ is the most general of these terms, conveying in its extended sense the idea of making known; but it is in many respects indefinite: we may _publish_ to many or few; but to _promulgate_ is always to make known to many. We may _publish_ that which is a domestic or a national concern; we _promulgate_ properly only that which is of general interest: the affairs of a family or of a nation are _published_ in the newspapers; doctrines, principles, precepts, and the like are _promulgated._  
We may _publish_ things to be known, or things not to be known; we _divulge_ things mostly not to be known: we may _publish_ our own shame or the shame of another, and we may _publish_ that which is advantageous to another; but we commonly _divulge_ the secrets or the crimes of another.  
To _publish_ is said of that which was never before known or never before existed; to _reveal_ and _disclose_ are said of that which has been only concealed or lain hidden: we _publish_ the events of the day; we _reveal_ the secret or the mystery of a transaction; we _disclose_ from beginning to end a whole affair which has never been properly known or accounted for.

####purpose 
**PURPOSE, PROPOSE.**  
We _purpose_ (see [design](entry://design)) that which is near at hand or immediately to be set about; we _propose_ that which is more distant: the former requires the setting before one's mind, the latter requires deliberation and plan. We _purpose_ many things which we never think worth while doing; but we ought not to _propose_ anything to ourselves which is not of too much importance to be lightly adopted or rejected. We _purpose_ to go to town on a certain day; we _pro ose_ to spend our time in a particular study. 

####pursue 
See **continue** under [continual](entry://continual); [follow](entry://follow)

####push 
**PUSH, SHOVE, THRUST, RAM.**  
All these words denote the giving an impulse to a body with more or less force, but differ as to the situation in which the impulse is given. _Push_ (ultimately from Latin _pulsare_, to beat, a frequentative of _pellere_, to drive), and _shove_, Anglo-Saxon _scufan_, require the bodies which give and receive the impulse to be in contact: one person cannot _push_ or _shove_, another without coming in direct personal contact with him; as when a person touches another in passing, it may be a _push_ more or less violent: to _shove_ is a continued action, which causes the body to move forward; as to _shove_ a load along the ground. A body may be both _pushed_ and _shoved_ along, but in the former case this is effected by repeated _pushes_, and in the latter case by a continuation of the same act. To _thrust_, like _push_, is a single act; but _thrusting_ is commonly performed by some instrument, as a polo, a stick, a hand, or some part of a body. It is a Scandinavian word allied to _threat_ and to Latin _trudere_, found in _intrude._  
A body may likewise, in a similar manner, _thrust_ itself, but it always _pushes_ or _shoves_ some other body.  
_Ram_ (a word which may be allied to _ram_, a male sheep, signifying to butt or strike as the sheep strikes with his horns) means also to _thrust_ into, but it implies a more sharp and energetic action than _thrust. Push_ and _shove_ do not imply injury to the object; _ram_ does. The word is applied as a substantive to a solid beak or point projecting from the bows of a war-vessel and enabling it to _ram_ or batter its opponent. 

####put 
**PUT, PLACE, LAY, SET.**  
_Put_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _potian_, to thrust, Middle English _putten. Place_ (see that word). _Lay_ is in Anglo-Saxon _licgan_, to cause to lie, Middle English _leggen. Put_ is the most general of all these terms; _place, lay_, and _set_ are but modes of _putting;_ one _puis_ things generally, but the way of _putting_ is not defined; one may _put_ a thing into one's room, one's desk, one's pocket, and the like; but to _place_ is to _put_ in a specific manner and for a specific purpose; one _places_ a book on a shelf as a fixed _place_ for it, and in a position most suitable to it. To _lay_ and _set_ are still more specific than _place_, the former being applied only to such things as can be made to lie; and _set_ only to such as can be made to stand: a book may be said to be _laid_ on the table when _placed_ in a downward position, and _set_ on a shelf when _placed_ on one end: we _lay_ ourselves down on the ground; we _set_ a trunk upon the ground. 

####putrefy 
See [rot](entry://rot)

####quail 
**QUAIL, COWER, CRINGE, KNUCKLE.**  
_Quail_ is from a Teutonic base, _kwal;_ cf. Modern German _qual_, anguish or distress. _Cower_, represented in Middle English by _couren_, is Scandinavian; it meant originally to lie quiet, to sit hunched up. _Cringe_, Anglo-Saxon _cringan_, meant to fall before the foe in battle. _Knuckle_, in Middle English _knokil_, a diminutive form allied to Middle Dutch _knoke_, a bone or knuckle, meant to place one's knuckles on the ground in shooting or casting marbles; it developed the meaning of to acknowledge one's self beaten in a game, to yield. All these words indicate a movement of fear or submission before an attack. _Quail_ is the strongest word. It implies an absolute sinking of heart, a loss of courage before an attack or a misfortune. _Cringe_ has a similar meaning, but is a milder word; it refers to a temporary physical shrinking before a blow. _Cower_ means to huddle together and shudder with fear. There is more of physical fear in _cower;_ more of mental and moral abasement accompanying fear in _cringe. Knuckle_ means to yield to another under pressure; it does not necessarily imply physical fear, however. 

####quake 
See [shake](entry://shake)

####qualification 
**QUALIFICATION, ACCOMPLISHMENT.**  
The _qualification_ (see [competent](entry://competent)) serves the purpose of utility; the _accomplishment_ serves to adorn: by the first we are enabled to make ourselves useful; by the second we are enabled to make ourselves agreeable. The _qualifications_ of a man who has an office to perform must be considered: of a man who has only pleasure to pursue, the _accomplishments_ are to be considered. A readiness with one's pen and a facility at accounts are necessary _qualifications_ either for a school or a counting-house; drawing is one of the most agreeable and suitable _accomplishments_ that can be given to a young person.  
**QUALIFY, TEMPER, HUMOR.** — _Qualify_ (see [competent](entry://competent)). _Temper_, from Latin _temperare_, is to regulate the temperament. _Humor_, from Latin _humor_, is to suit the _humor._ See [humor](entry://humor)  
Things are _qualified_ according to circumstances: what is too harsh must be _qualified_ by something that is soft and lenitive; things are _tempered_ by nature or by Providence, so that things perfectly discordant should not be combined; things are _humored_ by contrivance: what is subject to many changes requires to be _humored;_ a polite person will _qualify_ a refusal by some expression of kindness; Providence has _tempered_ the seasons so as to mix something that is pleasant in them all. Nature itself is sometimes to be _humored_ when art is employed: but the _tempers_ of man require still more to be _humored._  
See also [fit](entry://fit)

####quality 
**QUALITY, PROPERTY, ATTRIBUTE.**  
_Quality_, in Latin _qualitas_, from _qualis_, how constituted, signifies such as a thing really is. _Property_, from _proprius_, proper or one's own, signifies belonging to a thing as an essential ingredient. _Attribute_, in Latin _attributus_, participle of _attribuere_, to bestow upon, signifies the things bestowed upon or assigned to another.  
The _quality_ is that which is inherent in the thing and coexistent; the _property_ is that which belongs to it for the time being; the _attribute_ is the _quality_ which is assigned to any object. We cannot alter the _quality_ of a thing without altering the whole thing; but we may give or take away _properties_ from bodies at pleasure, without entirely destroying their identity; and we may ascribe _attributes_ at discretion.  
See also [fashion](entry://fashion)

####quandary 
**QUANDARY, DILEMMA.**  
These words both indicate a state of embarrassment in which the victim does not "know which way to turn. " _Quandary_ is a word of uncertain origin, possibly derived from scholastic Latin. _Dilemma_, Latin _dilemma_, Greek _δίλημμα_, is a double proposition or argument in which one is caught between two difficulties. It differs from _quandary_ in distinctly suggesting two difficulties and the impossibility of deciding between them. _Quandary_ simply suggests a general state of confusion and doubt. _Quandary_ is generally used in the phrase "in a _quandary. "_

####quantity 
See [deal](entry://deal)

####quarrel 
**QUARREL, BROIL, FEUD.**  
_Quarrel_, from Latin _querela_, a complaint (see **difference** under [differ](entry://differ)), is the general and ordinary term; _broil_ is in Old French _brouiller_, to jumble or confuse, allied to Italian _broglio_, whence the English _imbroglio_ is derived. _Feud_, Old French _feide_, is also allied to Anglo-Saxon _fœhd_, enmity, and _fáh_, hostile, modern English _foe._ The idea of a variance between two or more parties is common to these terms; but the first signifies the complaints and charges which are reciprocally made; _broil_ the confusion and entanglement which arise from a contention and collision of interests; _feud_ the hostilities which arise out of the variance. There are _quarrels_ where there are no _broils_, and there are both where there are no _feuds;_ but there are no _broils_ and _feuds_ without _quarrels._ The _quarrel_ is not always openly conducted between the parties; it may sometimes be secret and sometimes manifest itself only in a coolness of behavior: the _broil_ is a noisy kind of _quarrel_, it always breaks out in loud and most reproachful language: _feud_ is a deadly kind of quarrel which is heightened by mutual aggravations and insults. _Quarrels_ are very lamentable when they take place between members of the same family; _broils_ are very frequent among profligate and restless people who live together: _feuds_ were very general in former times between different families of the nobility.  
**QUARREL, AFFRAY, FRAY.** — A _quarrel_ is indefinite, both as to the cause and the manner in which it is conducted; an _affray_ or _fray_, from _frico_, to rub, signifies the conflict of the passions and is a particular kind of _quarrel:_ a _quarrel_ may arise between two persons from a private difference; an _affray_ always takes place between many upon some public occasion: a _quarrel_ may be carried on merely by words; an _affray_ is commonly conducted by acts of violence: many angry words pass in a _quarrel_ between too hasty people; many are wounded, if not killed, in _affrays_ when opposite parties meet.

####quarters 
**QUARTERS, ABODE, CANTONMENT, POST, STATION.**  
In these applications the term assumes the plural form and applies to both domestic and military concerns. _Abode_ and _dwelling_ imply any kind of habitation, lodging, or temporary residence. _Cantonment, post_, and _station_ are specifically military terms, implying, respectively, a part of a town allotted to a body of troops for temporary or permanent occupation; a permanent military establishment, as an important fortress, and a region assigned for the permanent location of a naval squadron, as the _Atlantic station._ The term _headquarters_ designates the _station_ or building where a commander-in-chief and his staff are located. 

####quell 
**QUELL, QUASH.**  
_Quell_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _cuellan_, to kill. It means to overcome completely, to reduce to quietness and peace. _Quash_ comes from Latin _quassare_, to shatter. In some connections it means to annul completely; in this sense it is used in legal procedure. It is also used to refer to the complete suppression of an idea or a proposal. The police _quell_ a riot; the opposition on a board of directors may _quash_ a plan that does not seem feasible. _Quell_ implies an active disturbance; _quash_ only an incipient disturbance. 

####querulous 
**QUERULOUS, PETULANT.**  
Both of these words apply to a fretful and dissatisfied temper, but they differ somewhat in their indication of the way in which the dissatisfaction shows itself. _Querulous_ comes from _querulus_, full of complaints, and like _quarrel_ (see above) derived ultimately from Latin _queri_, to complain. It means weakly and futilely complaining. A _querulous_ person does not rise to the height of a really energetic protest. He merely continues to object in an ineffectual and self-pitying tone. _Petulant_ comes from Latin _petulare_, a diminutive of _petere_, to attack in a small way. It refers to small outbursts in which there are more of wilfulness and "temper" than of the feeble misery implied in _querulous._ A cheerful person may be _petulant;_ he cannot be _querulous. Petulance_ is characteristic of healthy but undisciplined youth; _querulousness_ of feeble age.

####question 
**QUESTION, QUERY.**  
_Question_ (see [ask](entry://ask)). _Query_ is but a variation of _quœre_ (seek!), from the verb _quœrere_, the Latin imperative to seek or inquire.  
_Questions_ and _queries_ are both put for the sake of obtaining an answer; but the former may be for a reasonable or unreasonable cause; a _query_ is mostly a rational _question:_ idlers may put _questions_ from mere curiosity; learned men put _queries_ for the sake of information. 

####quick 
See [sudden](entry://sudden)

####quickness 
**QUICKNESS, SWIFTNESS, FLEETNESS, CELERITY, RAPIDITY, VELOCITY.**  
These terms are all applied to the motion of bodies, of which _quickness_, from _quick_, denotes the general and simple idea which characterizes all the rest. _Quickness_ is nearly akin to life (from Anglo-Saxon _cwic_, alive, lively — the older meaning of which is found in the phrase the "quick and the dead" in the Apostles' Creed) and is directly opposed to slowness. _Swiftness_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _swifan_, to move quickly; and _fleetness_ is allied to Anglo-Saxon _fleotan_, to float. _Swiftness_ and _fleetness_ express higher degrees of _quickness. Celerity_, from Latin _celer_, Greek _κέλης_, a racer; _velocity_, ultimately from _volo_, to fly; and _rapidity_, from _rapere_, to seize or hurry along, differ more in application than in degree. _Quick_ and _swift_ are applicable to any objects; men are _quick_ in moving, _swift_ in running: dogs hear _quickly_, and run _swiftly;_ a mill goes _quickly_ or _swiftly_ round, according to the force of the wind: _fleetness_ is the peculiar characteristic of winds or horses; a horse _is fleet_ in the race, and is sometimes described to be as _fleet_ as the winds: that which we wish to characterize as particularly _quick_ in our ordinary operations we say is done with _celerity;_ in this manner our thoughts pass with _celerity_ from one object to another: those things are said to move with _rapidity_ which seem to hurry everything away with them; a river or stream moves with _rapidity;_ time goes on with _rapid_ flight: _velocity_ signifies the _swiftness_ of flight, which is a motion that exceeds all others in _swiftness:_ hence, we speak of the _velocity_ of a ball shot from a cannon, or of a celestial body moving in its orbit; sometimes these words, _rapidity_ and _velocity_, are applied in the improper sense by way of emphasis to the very _swift_ movements of other bodies: in this manner the wheel of a carriage is said to move _rapidly;_ and the flight of an animal, or the progress of a vessel before the wind, is compared to the flight of a bird in point of _velocity._

####quite 
**QUITE, COMPLETELY, ENTIRELY, PERFECTLY, TOTALLY, WHOLLY.**  
These terms are so similar and so interchangeable in all respects that there is no necessity for a discrimination between them. The original significance and derivation can be found under the corresponding adjective forms. _Quite_, of the same origin (Middle English _quite_ as _quit_, and connoting a similar finality), is, strictly speaking, synonymous with the words here given rather than with _rather_ or _very_, with which it is often interchanged, as when we say _quite_ good, meaning not _entirely_ good, but _rather_ good. 

####quiver 
See [shake](entry://shake)

####quixotic 
**QUIXOTIC, FANTASTIC, VISIONARY.**  
Properly speaking, _Quixotic_ has no synonymes because it signifies acts akin in nature to those of Don Quixote, the hero of Cervantes's romance of that name, champion of all persons in distress and observer of all the magnanimities of knighthood. Don Quixote being a character absolutely unique in literature, there is no adjective that corresponds to _Quixotic;_ but _fantastic_ (from Greek _φαντασία_, vision, unreal appearance), signifying that which resembles the strange world of dreams, and _visionary_ (Latin _visio)_, which has the same original meaning, but suggests not the oddness and waywardness of the dream world, but its unreality and its wistful appeal — these two words partly correspond to the quality of action and thought indicated in _Quixotic_, while suggesting none of the humor and pathos, the contrast between the noble intention and the awkward and ridiculous action, also implied in that word. 

####quote 
See [cite](entry://cite)

####race 
**RACE, GENERATION, BREED.**  
_Race_ (see [family](entry://family)). _Generation_, in Latin _generatio_, from _generare_, signifies the thing begotten. _Breed_ signifies that which is _bred_ (see [breed](entry://breed)). These terms are all employed in regard to a number of animate objects which have the same origin; the first two are said only of human beings, the latter only of animals: the term _race_ is employed in regard to the dead as well as the living; _generation_ is employed mostly in regard to the living: hence we speak of the _race_ of the Heraclidæ, the _race_ of the Bourbons, the _race_ of the Stuarts, and the like; but the present _generation_, the whole _generation_, a worthless _generation_, and the like (yet we also speak of past _generations): breed_ is said of those animals which are brought forth and brought up in the same manner. Hence, we denominate some domestic animals as of a good _breed_, where particular heed is given to the animals from which they come, and special care is taken of those which are brought forth.

####radiance 
**RADIANCE, BRILLIANCY.**  
Both these terms express the circumstance of a great light in a body; but _radiance_, from _radius_, a ray, denotes the emission of rays, and is, therefore, peculiarly applicable to bodies naturally luminous, like the heavenly bodies; and _brilliancy_ (see [bright](entry://bright)) denotes the whole body of light emitted, and may, therefore, be applied equally to natural and artificial light. The _radiancy_ of the sun, moon, and stars constitutes a part of their beauty; the _brilliancy_ of a diamond is frequently compared with that of a star.  
_Brilliancy_ is applied to objects which shine or glitter like a diamond. It is also applied figuratively to moral objects. 

####radiate 
See [shine](entry://shine)

####radiograph 
**RADIOGRAPH, PICTURE, REPRESENTATION.**  
A _radiograph_, from the Latin _radio_, a ray, and the Greek _γράφω,_ to write, is a _picture_ or _representation_ of an object in shadowy form by the action of Röntgen or X-rays on certain sensitive salts. It is a modern aid of great value in surgical science.

####rapacious 
**RAPACIOUS, RAVENOUS, VORACIOUS.**  
_Rapacious_, in Latin _rapax_, from _rapere_, to seize, signifies seizing or grasping anything with an eager desire to possess. _Ravenous_, from the Latin _rapina_, from _rapere_, to seize, signifies the same as _rapacious. Voracious_, from _vorax_, based on _vorare_, to devour, signifies an eagerness to devour.  
The idea of greediness, which forms the leading feature in the signification of all these terms, is varied in the subject and the object: _rapacious_ is the quality peculiar to beasts of prey or what is like beasts of prey: _ravenous_ and _voracious_ are common to all animals when impelled by hunger. The beasts of the forest are _rapacious_ at all times; all animals are more or less _ravenous_ or _voracious_, as circumstances may make them: the term _rapacious_ applies to the seizing of anything that is eagerly wanted; _ravenous_ applies to the seizing of anything which one takes for one's food: a lion is _rapacious_ when it seizes on its prey: it is _ravenous_ in the act of consuming it. The word _ravenous_ implies the haste with which one eats; the word _voracious_ the quantity which one consumes: a _ravenous_ person is loath to wait for the dressing or cooking of his food; he consumes it without any preparation: a _voracious_ person not only eats in haste, but he consumes great quantities and continues to do so for a long time. Abstinence from food for an unusual length, of time will make any healthy creature _ravenous;_ habitual intemperance in eating or an abnormal appetite will produce _voracity._  
In an extended sense, _rapacity_ is applied as a characteristic of persons to denote their eagerness to seize anything which falls in their way.  
_Ravenous_ denotes an excess of _rapacity_, and _voracious_ is applied figuratively to moral objects.

####rapidity 
See [quickness](entry://quickness)

####rapine 
**RAPINE, PLUNDER, PILLAGE.**  
The idea of property taken from another contrary to his consent is included in all these terms: but the term _rapine_, from Latin _rapina_ (see above), implies most violence; _plunder_ (from a Germanic word signifying trash, baggage, plunder), meaning to strip a house even of its least valuable contents, includes removal or carrying away; _pillage_, derived from Latin _pilare_, to pull out hair, to strip entirely, means wholesale booty which is searched for and taken away. A soldier who makes a sudden incursion into an enemy's country and carries away whatever comes within his reach is guilty of _rapine:_ he goes into a house full of property, and carries away much _plunder;_ he enters with the rest of the army into a town, and, stripping it of everything that was to be found, goes away loaded with _pillage;_ mischief and bloodshed attend _rapine:_ loss attends _plunder;_ distress and ruin follow wherever there has been _pillage._

####rapture 
See [ecstasy](entry://ecstasy)

####rare 
**RARE, SCARCE, SINGULAR.**  
_Rare_, in Latin _rarus. Scarce_ comes from Low Latin _scarpsus_, a shortened form of _excarpsus_, for classical _excerptus_, to select, meaning picked out. _Singular_ (see [particular](entry://particular)).  
_Rare_ and _scarce_ both imply number or quantity, which admit of expansion or diminution: _rare_ is a thinned number; _scarce_ is a quantity cut short. _Rare_ is applied to matters of convenience or luxury; _scarce_ to matters of utility or necessity: that which is _rare_ becomes valuable and fetches a high price; that which is _scarce_ becomes precious, and the loss of it is seriously felt. The best of everything is in its nature _rare;_ there will never be a superfluity of such things; there are, however, some things, as particularly curious plants or particular animals, which, owing to circumstances, are always _rare:_ that which is most in use will, in certain cases, be _scarce;_ when the supply of an article fails, and the demand for it continues, it naturally becomes scarce. An aloe in blossom is a _rarity_, for nature has prescribed such limits to its growth as to give but very few of such flowers: the paintings of Raphael and the distinguished painters of former days are daily becoming more _scarce_, because time will diminish their quantity, although not their value.  
What is _rare_ will often be _singular_ and what is _singular_ will often, on that account, be _rare:_ but these terms are not necessarily applied to the same object: fewness is the idea common to both; but _rare_ is said of that of which there might be more; while _singular_ is applied to that which is single or nearly single in its kind. The _rare_ is that which is always sought for; the _singular_ is not always that which one esteems: a thing is _rare_ which is difficult to obtain; a thing is _singular_ for its peculiar qualities, good or bad. Indian plants are many of them _rare_ in England, because the climate will not agree with them: the sensitive plant is _singular_, as its quality of yielding to the touch distinguishes it from all others.

####rash 
See **foolhardy** under [fool](entry://fool); [sudden](entry://sudden)

####rashness 
**RASHNESS, TEMERITY, HASTINESS, PRECIPITANCY.**  
_Rashness_ denotes the quality of being _rash._ Cf. Anglo-Saxon _rœscan_, to flash, to move quickly and abruptly; Modern German _rasch_, quick. _Temerity_ comes from Latin _temere_, from a root meaning gloom, darkness; and signifies the tendency to act "in the dark"; without sufficient information or foresight. _Hastiness_ (see [angry ](entry://angry )and CURSORY). _Precipitancy_, from the Latin _prœcipiti_, a crude form of _prœceps_, headlong, based on _prœ_, before, and _caput_, head, means, literally, the quality of being headlong, and signifies the quality or disposition of taking things before they ought to be taken.  
_Rashness_ and _temerity_ have a close alliance with each other in sense; but they have a slight difference which is entitled to notice: _rashness_ is a general and indefinite term, in the signification of which an unreasoned and impulsive swiftness of action is the leading idea: this may arise either from a vehemence of character or a temporary ardor of the mind: in the signification of _temerity_, the leading idea is want of consideration, springing mostly from an overweening confidence or a presumptuous character. _Rashness_ is therefore applied to corporeal actions, as the jumping into a river without being able to swim, or the leaping over a hedge without being an expert horseman; _temerity_ is applied to our moral actions, particularly such as require deliberation and a calculation of consequences. _Hastiness_ and _precipitancy_ are but modes or characteristics of _rashness_, and consequently employed only in particular cases, as _hastiness_ in regard to our movements, and _precipitancy_ in regard to our measures. 

####rate 
**RATE, PROPORTION, RATIO.**  
_Rate_ (see [estimate](entry://estimate)) and _ratio_, which has the same origin and original meaning as _rate_, are in sense species of _proportion_ (see [proportion](entry://proportion)): that is, they are supposed or estimated _proportions_, in distinction from _proportions_ that he in the nature of things. The first term, _rate_, is employed in ordinary affairs; a person receives a certain sum weekly at the _rate_ of a certain sum yearly: _ratio_ is applied only to numbers and calculations; as two is to four, so is four to eight, and eight to sixteen; the _ratio_ in this case being double: _proportion_ is employed in matters of science, and in all cases where the two more specific terms are not admissible; the beauty of an edifice depends upon observing the doctrine of _proportions;_ in the disposing of soldiers a certain regard must be had to _proportion_ in the height and size of the men.  
See also [tax](entry://tax); **value** under [valuable](entry://valuable)

####ratify 
**RATIFY, APPROVE, BIND, CONFIRM, CORROBORATE, SETTLE, SUBSTANTIATE.**  
_Ratify_, from French _ratifier_, from Latin _ratus_, fixed, and _ficare_, a crude form of _facere_, to make, in its broadest sense implies the settlement or establishment of something. We _approve_ something that has been considered without previous action or already done for us by another; we _bind_ ourselves to a specific action, as in a contract; we _confirm_ an agreement reached in consultation; we _corroborate_ something that has been said or done before; we _settle_ a proposal, controversy, business affair; and we _substantiate_ or prove a prior assertion, declaration. All of these actions are or may be _confirmed_ in writings signed by the parties in interest.  
A _ratification_ is the act or evidence of _ratifying._ As an act it is that by which a competent authority _confirms_ or accepts something done by another. In the case of a person who has reached his or her majority, it is an approval of something done during the period of minority which gives validity to what was done. 

####rational 
See [reasonable](entry://reasonable)

####ravage 
**RAVAGE, DESOLATION, DEVASTATION.**  
_Ravage_ takes its root from the Latin _rapere_, signifying a seizing or tearing away. _Desolation_, from _solus_, alone, signifies made solitary or reduced to solitude. _Devastation_, in Latin _devastatio_, from _devastare_, to lay waste, based on _vasius_, waste, signifies reducing to a waste or desert.  
_Ravage_ expresses less than either _desolation_ or _devastation:_ a breaking, tearing, or destroying is implied in the word _ravage;_ but _desolation_ signifies the entire unpeopling of a land, and _devastation_ the entire clearing away of every vestige of cultivation. Torrents, flames, and tempests _ravage;_ war, plague, and famine _desolate;_ armies of barbarians, who overrun a country, carry _devastation_ with them wherever they go.  
_Ravage_ is employed likewise in the moral application; _desolation_ and _devastation_ only in the proper application to countries. Disease makes its _ravages_ on beauty; death makes its _ravages_ among men in a more terrible degree at one time than at another.

####ray 
**RAY, BEAM.**  
_Ray_ (see [gleam](entry://gleam)) is indefinite in its meaning; it may be said either of a large or small quantity of light: _beam_, from Anglo-Saxon _beam_, is something positive; it can be said only of that which is considerable. We may speak of _rays_ either of the sun or the stars or any other luminous body; but we speak of the _beams_ of the sun or the moon. The _rays_ of the sun break through the clouds; its _beams_ are scorching at noonday. A room can scarcely be so shut up that a single _ray_ of light shall not penetrate through the crevices; the sea, in a calm moonlight night, presents a beautiful spectacle, with the moon's _beams_ playing on its waves.

####ready 
**READY, APT, PROMPT.**  
_Ready_ (see **easy** under [ease](entry://ease)) is in general applied to that which has been intentionally prepared for a given purpose; _prompt_ (see [expeditious](entry://expeditious)) is applied to that which is at hand so as to answer the immediate purpose; _apt_, from _aptus_, fit, is applied to that which is fit or from its nature has a tendency to produce effects.  
When applied as personal characteristics, _ready_ connotes the will or understanding, which is prepared for anything; as _ready_ to serve a person, a _ready_ wit; _prompt_ denotes the vigor or zeal which impels to action without delay, or at the moment when wanted; and _apt_, a fitness to do anything from the habit or temper of the mind.

####reasonable 
**REASONABLE, RATIONAL.**  
_Reasonable_, or according to reason, and _rational_, having _reason_, are both derived from the same Latin word _ratio_, reason, which, from _ratus_, itself from _reor_, to think, signifies the thinking faculty. They differ principally according to the different meanings of the word _reason. Reasonable_ is sometimes applied to persons in the general sense of having the faculty of _reason._ But more frequently the word _rational_ is used in this abstract sense of _reason._  
In application to things _reasonable_ and _rational_ both signify according to _reason;_ but the former is used in reference to the business of life, as a _reasonable_ proposal, wish, etc.; _rational_ to abstract matters, as _rational_ motives, grounds, questions, etc.

**REBOUND, REVERBERATE, RECOIL.**  
To _rebound_ is to bound or spring back: a ball _rebounds._ To _reverberate_ (from Latin _verber_, a scourge) is to beat back: a sound _reverberates_ when it echoes. To _recoil_ is to _coil_ (from Latin _cuius_, hinder part) or whirl back: a snake _recoils._ The two former are used in an improper application, although rarely; but we may say of _recoil_ that a man's schemes will _recoil_ on his own head.

####recede 
**RECEDE, RETREAT, RETIRE, WITHDRAW, SECEDE.**  
To _recede_ is to go back; to _retreat_ is to draw back; the former is a simple action, suited to one's convenience: the latter is a particular action, dictated by necessity: we _recede_ by a direct backward movement; we _retreat_ by an indirect backward movement; we _recede_ a few steps in order to observe an object more distinctly; we _retreat_ from the position we have taken in order to escape danger; whoever can advance can _recede;_ but in general only those _retreat_ whose advance is not free: _receding_ is the act of every one; _retreating_ is peculiarly the act of soldiers or those who make hostile movements.  
To _retire_ and _withdraw_ signify fundamentally the same as _retreat_, that is, to draw back or off; but they agree in application mostly with _recede_, to denote leisurely and voluntary acts: to _recede_ is to go back from a given spot; but to _retire_ and _withdraw_ have implication of the place or the presence of the persons: we may recede on an open plain, but we _retire_ or _withdraw_ from a room or from some company. In this application _withdraw_ is the more familiar term: _retire_ may likewise be used for an army; but it denotes a much more leisurely action than _retreat:_ a general _retreats_, by compulsion, before an enemy, but he may _retire_ from an enemy's country when there is no enemy present. _Recede, retreat, retire_, and _withdraw_ are also used in a moral application; _secede_ is used only in this sense: a person _recedes_ from his engagement or his pretentions; he _retires_ from business or _withdraws_ from a society. To _secede_ is a public act; men _secede_ from a religious or political body; _withdraw_ is a private act; they _withdraw_ themselves as individual members from any society. 

####receipt 
**RECEIPT, RECEPTION.**  
_Receipt_ comes from _receive_, in its application to inanimate objects, which are taken into possession. _Reception_ comes from the same verb, in the sense of treatment of persons at their first arrival: in the commercial intercourse of men, the _receipt_ of goods or money must be acknowledged in writing; in the friendly intercourse of men, their _reception_ of each other will be polite or cold, according to the sentiments entertained toward the individual.

####reckon 
**RECKON, COUNT, ACCOUNT, NUMBER.**  
The idea of estimating is common to these terms, which differ less in meaning than in application: _reckon_ (see [calculate](entry://calculate)) is the most familiar; _account_ and _number, i.e._, to put in the _number_, are employed only in the grave style: we _reckon_ it a happiness to enjoy the company of a particular friend; we ought to _account_ it a privilege to be enabled to address our Maker by prayer; we must all expect to be one day _numbered_ with the dead. 

####reclaim 
**RECLAIM, REFORM.**  
_Reclaim_, from the Latin prefix _re_, again, and _clamare_, to call, signifies to call back to its right place that which has gone astray. _Reform_ signifies to _form_ anew that which has changed its _form:_ they are allied only in their application to the moral character. A man is _reclaimed_ from his vicious actions by the force of advice or exhortation; he may be _reformed_ by various means, external or internal. A parent endeavors to _reclaim_ a child, but too often in vain; the offender is in general not _reformed._

####recline 
**RECLINE, REPOSE.**  
To _recline_ is to lean back; to _repose_ is to place one's self back and usually to rest: he who _reclines, reposes:_ but we may _recline_ without _reposing:_ when we _recline_ we put ourselves into a particular _position;_ but when we _repose_ we put ourselves into that position which will be most easy and enable us to rest. 

####recognize 
**RECOGNIZE, ACKNOWLEDGE.**  
_Recognize_, in Latin _recognoscere_, is to take _cognizance_ of that which comes again before our notice; to _acknowledge_ (see [acknowledge](entry://acknowledge)) is to admit to one's _knowledge_ whatever comes freshly to our notice: we _recognize_ a person whom we have known before; we _recognize_ him either in his former character or in some newly assumed character; we _acknowledge_ either former favors or those which have been just received: princes _recognize_ 3ertain principles which have been admitted by previous consent; they _acknowledge_ the justice of claims which are preferred before them.

####record 
**RECORD, REGISTER, ARCHIVE.**  
_Record_ is taken for the thing _recorded_, or the collection in which a thing is _recorded; register_, either for the thing _registered_ or the place in which it is _registered; archive_, mostly for the place, and sometimes for the thing: _records_ are either historical details or short notices, which serve to preserve the memory of things; _registers_ are but short notices of particular and local circumstances; _archives_ are always connected with the state: every place of antiquity has its _records_ of the different circumstances which have been connected with its rise and progress and the various changes which it has experienced; in public _registers_ we find accounts of families and of their various connections and fluctuations; in _a, chives_ we find all legal deeds and instruments which involve the interests of the nation, both in its internal and external economy. In an extended application of these terms, _records_ contain whatever is to be remembered at ever so distant a period; _registers_, that which is to serve present purposes; _archives_, that in which any things are stored.

####recount 
See [relate](entry://relate)

####recover 
**RECOVER, RETRIEVE, REPAIR, RECRUIT.**  
_Recover_ comes from Latin _recuperare_ (whence English _recuperate_ is derived), compounded of _re_, again, and _cipere_, a weakened form of _capere_, to take, contaminated with _sabine; cuprus_, good, signifying to recover and make good again. _Retrieve_, from the occasional form of the Old French _retreuver_, Modern _retrouver_, is to find again. _Repair_, in French _réparer_, Latin _reparo_, from _re_ and _parare_, to make ready or right again, signifies to make a thing as good as it was before. _Recruit_ is an ill-formed word from French _recroître_, Latin _recrescere_, to grow again.  
_Recover_ is the most general term, and applies to objects in general; _retrieve, repair_, and the others are only partial applications: we _recover_ things either by our own means or by chance; we _retrieve_ and _repair_ by our own efforts only: we _recover_ that which has been taken or that which has been lost; we _retrieve_ that which has not finally been impaired or consumed; we _repair_ that which has been injured; we _recruit_ that which has been diminished: we _recover_ property from those who wish to deprive us of it; we _retrieve_ our misfortunes or our lost reputation; we _repair_ the damage done to our property; we _recruit_ the strength which has been exhausted: we do not seek after that which we think _irrecoverable;_ we give that up which is _irretrievable;_ we do not labor on that which is _irreparable;_ our power of _recruiting_ depends upon circumstances; he who makes a moderate use of his resources may in general easily _recruit_ himself when they are gone.  
**RECOVERY, RESTORATION.** — _Recovery_ is the regaining of any object which has been lost or missing; _restoration_ is the getting back of what has been taken away or that of which one has been deprived. What is _recovered_ may be _recovered_ with or without the use of means; the _restoration_ is effected by others' agency; that which is lost by accident may be _recovered_ by accident; the _restoration_ of a prince to his throne is mostly effected by his subjects.  
In respect to health or other things, _recovery_ signifies, as before, the regaining something; and _restoration_, the bringing back to its former state.  
See also **recruit** under [recover](entry://recover)

####recreant 
**RECREANT, APOSTATE, RENEGADE.**  
These words all signify one who repudiates a faith or a cause to which he has given his allegiance. _Recreant_, from Low Latin _recredere_, from Latin _re_, again, and _credere_, to believe, meaning to believe again, carries most condemnation. A _recreant_ is thought of as cowardly and dastardly, and the word is applied not merely to one who repudiates a particular faith, but to one who is generally faithless and unreliable. _Renegade_, from Latin _re_, again, and _negare_, to deny, also signifies one who abandons a faith or a cause; but it does not carry so strong a suggestion of something cowardly and despicable. _Apostate_ has a more limited significance. It is derived from Late Latin _apostata_, from Greek _αποστάτης_, off, _στάνης_, a standing, meaning a standing off, a separation, and it refers specifically to one who repudiates a religious belief. Julian, the _Apostate_, was so called because he reverted from Christianity to paganism.

See [correct](entry://correct)

####rectitude 
**RECTITUDE, UPRIGHTNESS.**  
_Rectitude_, based on Latin _rectus_, straight, is properly rightness, which is expressed in a stronger manner by _uprightness:_ we speak of the _rectitude_ of conduct or of judgment; of _uprightness_ of mind or of moral character, which must be something more than straight, for it must be elevated above everything mean or devious. 

####redeem 
**REDEEM, RANSOM.**  
_Redeem_, in Latin _redimere_, is compounded of _red_ and _emere_, to buy off, or back to one's self. _Ransom_ comes from the substantive _redemptio_, redemption, corresponding to _redimere. Redeem_ is a term of general application; _ransom_ is employed only on particular occasions: we _redeem_ persons as well as things; we _ransom_ persons only: we may _redeem_ by labor or by anything which supplies an equivalent for money; we _ransom_ persons with money only: we _redeem_ a watch or whatever has been given in pawn; we _ransom_ a captive: _redeem_ is employed in the improper application; _ransom_ only in the proper sense: we may _redeem_ our character, _redeem_ our life, or _redeem_ our honor; and in this sense our Saviour _redeems_ repentant sinners; but those who are _ransomed_ recover only their bodily liberty. 

####redemption 
See [salvation](entry://salvation)

####redress 
**REDRESS, RELIEF.**  
_Redress_, like address (see [accost](entry://accost)), in all probability from the Low Latin _drectus_, for _directus_, straight, right, and hence signifying to make straight or right, is said only with regard to matters of right and justice; _relief_ (see [help](entry://help)) to those of kindness and humanity: by power we obtain _redress;_ by active interference we obtain _relief:_ an injured person looks for _redress_ to the government; an unfortunate person looks for _relief_ to the compassionate and land: what we suffer through the oppression or wickedness of others can be _redressed_ only by those who have the power of dispensing justice; whenever we suffer, in the order of Providence, we may meet with some _relief_ from those who are more favored. _Redress_ applies to public as well as private grievances; _relief_ applies only to private distresses: under a pretence of seeking _redress_ of grievances, mobs are frequently assembled to the disturbance of the better disposed; under a pretence of soliciting charitable _relief_, thieves gain admittance into families. 

####reduce 
**REDUCE, LOWER.**  
_Reduce_ is to bring back or to a given point, _i.e._, in an extended sense, to bring down; _lower_ is to make _low_ or _lower_, which proves the close connection of these words in their original meaning; it is, however, only in their improper application that they have any further connection. _Reduce_ is used in the sense of lessen when applied to number, quantity, price, etc.; _lower_ is used in the same sense when applied to price, demands, terms, etc.: the former, however, occurs in cases where circumstances as well as persons are concerned; the latter only in cases where persons act: the price of corn is _reduced_ by means of importation; a person _lowers_ his price or his demand when he finds it too high.  
In the moral application, _reduce_ expresses more than _lower;_ a man is said to be _reduced_ to an abject condition, but to be _lowered_ in the estimation of others; to be _reduced_ to a state of slavery, to be _lowered_ in his own eyes.

####refer 
**REFER, RELATE, RESPECT, REGARD.**  
_Refer_, from the Latin _re_ and _ferre_, signifies, literally, to bring back; and _relate_, from the participle _latus_, of the same verb, signifies brought back: the former is, therefore, transitive, and the latter intransitive. _Refer_ is commonly said of circumstances that carry the memory to events or circumstances; _relate_ is said of things that have a natural connection: the religious festivals and ceremonies of the Roman Catholics have all a _reference_ to some events that happened in the early periods of Christianity; the notes and observations at the end of a book _relate_ to what has been inserted in the text.  
_Refer_ and _relate_ carry us back to that which may be very distant; but _respect_ and _regard_ (see [esteem](entry://esteem)) turn our views to that which is near. Whatever _respects_ or _regards_ a thing has a moral influence over it; it is the duty of the magistrates to take into consideration whatever _respects_ the good order of the community; laws _respect_ the general welfare of the community; the due administration of the laws _regards_ the happiness of the individual. Neither of these verbs, as such, are in common use to-day, except in such fixed formulas as _in respect_ or _in regard to, as respects_ or _as regards_ a given object or idea.

####reform 
**REFORM, REFORMATION.**  
_Reform_ has a general application; _reformation_ a particular application: whatever undergoes such a change as to give a new form to an object occasions a _reform;_ when such a change is produced, or claimed to be produced, in the moral character either of persons or institutions, it is termed a _reformation:_ the concerns of a state require occasional _reform;_ those of an individual require _reformation;_ the _Reformation_ was the work of Martin Luther. When _reform_ and _reformation_ are applied to the moral character, the former has a more extensive signification than the latter; the term _reform_ conveying the idea of a complete amendment; _reformation_ implying only the process of amending or improving. A _reform_ in one's life and conversation will always be accompanied by a corresponding increase of happiness to the individual; when we observe any approaches to _reformation_, we may cease to despair of the individual who shows such tendency.

####refuse 
**REFUSE, DECLINE, REJECT, REPEL, REBUFF.**  
_Refuse_ (see [deny](entry://deny)), from Latin _refundere_, signifies simply to pour back — that is, to send back — which is the common idea of all these terms. _Decline_, in Latin _declinare_, signifies, literally, to turn aside; _reject_, from _jactare_, to throw, to cast back; _repel_, from _pellere_, to drive, to drive back. _Rebuff_ comes from Latin _re_, back, and _buffare_, a word of onomatopoeic or imitative origin, like English _puff. Refuse_ is an unqualified action: it is accompanied by no expression of opinion; _decline_ is a gentle and indirect mode of refusal; _reject_ is a direct mode, and conveys a positive sentiment of disapprobation: we _refuse_ what is asked of us for want of inclination to comply; we _decline_ what is proposed from motives of discretion; we _reject_ what is offered to us because it does not fall in with our views: we _refuse_ to listen to the suggestions of our friends; we _decline_ an offer of service; we _reject_ the insinuations of the interested and evil-minded.  
To _refuse_ is said only of that which passes between individuals; to _reject_ is said of that which comes from any quarter: requests and petitions are _refused_ by those who are solicited; opinions, propositions, and counsels are _rejected_ by particular communities: the king _refuses_ to give his assent to a bill; the Parliament _rejects_ it.  
To _repel_ is to _reject_ with violence; to _rebuff_ is to _refuse_ with contempt or what may be considered as such. We _refuse_ and _reject_ that which is either offered or simply presents itself for acceptance: the act may be negative or not outwardly expressed; we _repel_ and _rebuff_ that which forces itself into our presence contrary to our inclination: it is in both cases a direct act of force; we _repel_ the attack of an enemy, or we _repel_ the advances of one who is not agreeable; we _rebuff_ those who put that in our way which is offensive. Importunate persons must necessarily expect to meet with _rebuffs_, and are in general less susceptible to them than others; sensitive minds feel a _refusal_ as a _rebuff._

####relate 
**RELATE (see [refer](entry://refer)), RECOUNT, DESCRIBE.**  
_Relate_, in Latin _relatus_, participle of _referre_, signifies to bring that to the notice of others which has before been brought to our own notice. _Recount_ is properly to _count_ again or _count_ over again. _Describe_, from the Latin _scribere_, to write, is literally to write down.  
The idea of giving an account of events or circumstances is common to all these terms, which differ in the object and circumstances of the action. _Relate_ is said generally of all events, both of those which concern others as well as ourselves; _recount_ is said particularly of those things in which the recounter has a special interest: those who _relate_ all they hear often _relate_ that which never happened; it is gratification to an old soldier to _recount_ all the events in which he had a part during the military career of his early youth. We _relate_ events that have happened at any period of time immediate or remote; we _recount_ mostly those things which have been long past: in _recounting_, the memory reverts to past scenes and _counts_ over all that has deeply interested the mind. Travellers are pleased to _relate_ to their friends the noteworthy or remarkable things they have seen in other countries; the _recounting_ of our adventures in distant regions of the globe has a peculiar interest for all who hear them. We may _relate_ either by writing or by word of mouth; we _recount_ mostly by word of mouth. _Relate_ is said properly of events or that which passes: _describe_ is said of that which exists: we _relate_ the particulars of our journey, and we _describe_ the country we pass through. Personal adventure is always the subject of a _relation;_ the quality and condition of things are the subject of the _description._ We _relate_ what happened on meeting a friend; we _describe_ the dress of the parties or the ceremonies which are usual on particular occasions.  
**RELATION, RECITAL, NARRATION, NARRATIVE.** — _Relation_, from the verb _relate_, denotes the act of _relating_ or the thing _related. Recital_, from _recite_ (Latin _re_, again, and _citare_, to quote), denotes the act of _reciting_ or the thing _recited. Narration_, from _narrate_ (from Latin _narus, gnarus_, knowing), denotes either the act of _narrating_ or the thing _narrated. Narrative_, from the same verb, denotes the thing _narrated. Relation_ is here, as in the former paragraphs, the general, and the others the particular terms. _Relation_ applies to every object which is related, whether of a public or private, a national or an individual nature, history is the _relation_ of national events; biography is the _relation_ of particular lives; _recital_ is the _relation_ or _repetition_ of actual or existing circumstances; we listen to the _recital_ of misfortunes, distresses, and the like. The _relation_ may concern matters of indifference: the _recital_ is always of something that affects the interests of some individual: the pages of the journalist are filled with the _relation_ of daily occurrences which simply amuse in the reading: but the _recital_ of another's woes often draws tears from the audience to whom it is made. _Relation_ and _recital_ are seldom employed without connection with the object _related_ or _recited; narrative_ is mostly used by itself: hence We say the _relation_ of any particular circumstance; the _recital_ of any one's calamities; but an affecting _narrative_, or a simple _narrative._  
See also **connection** under [connect](entry://connect)  
**RELATION, RELATIVE, KINSMAN, KINDRED.** — _Relation_ is here taken to express the person _related;_ it is, as in the former paragraph, the general term both in sense and application; _relative_ is employed only as respects the particular individual to whom one is _related; kinsman_ designates the particular kind of _relation_, and _kindred_ is a collective term comprehending all one's _relations_ or those who are one's kin. In abstract propositions the word _relations_ is used in a more extended and universal sense: a man who is without _relations_ feels himself an outcast from society; in designating one's close and intimate connection with persons we use the term _relative;_ our near and dear _relatives_ are the first objects of our regard: in designating one's _relationship_ and connection with persons, _kinsman_ is preferable; when a man has no children, he frequently adopts one of his _kinsmen_ as his heir: when the ties of _relationship_ are to be specified in the persons of any particular family, they are denominated _kindred;_ a man cannot abstract himself from his _kindred_ while he retains any spark of human feeling.

####relax 
**RELAX, REMIT.**  
The general idea of lessening is that which allies these words to each other; but they differ very widely in then original meaning and somewhat in their ordinary application; _relax_, from _re_, again, and _laxare_, to loosen, signifies to make loose, and in its moral use to lessen anything in its degree of tightness or rigor; to _remit_, from _re_, again, and _mittere_, to send, signifies to take off in part or entirely that which has been imposed, that is, to lessen in quantity. In regard to our own attempts to act, we may speak of _relaxing_ in our endeavors and _remitting_ our labors or exertions, though the latter in this sense is now very rarely used: in regard to our dealings with others, we may speak of _relaxing_ in discipline, _relaxing_ in the severity or strictness of our conduct, of _remitting_ a punishment or _remitting_ a sentence. The discretionary power of showing mercy when placed in the hands of the sovereign serves to _relax_ the rigor of the law; when the punishment seems to be disproportionate to the magnitude of the offence, it is but equitable to _remit_ it.

####remains 
**REMAINS, RELICS.**  
_Remains_ signifies, literally, what _remains: relics_, from _relictus_, the past participle of the Latin _relinquere_, to leave, signifies what is left. The former is a term of general and familiar application; the latter is specific. What _remains_ after the use or consumption of anything is termed the _remains;_ what is left of anything after a lapse of years is the _relic_ or _relics._ There are _remains_ of buildings mostly after a conflagration; there are _relics_ of antiquity in most monasteries and old churches. _Remains_ are of value, or not, according to the circumstances of the case; _relics_ always derive a value from the person to whom they were supposed originally to belong. The _remains_ of a person — that is, what corporeally _remains_ of a person after the extinction of life — will be respected by his friend; a bit of a garment that belonged, or was supposed to belong, to some saint will be a precious _relic_ in the eyes of many devout Roman Catholics. All nations have agreed to respect the _remains_ of the dead; religion, under most forms, has given a sacredness to _relics_ in the eyes of its most zealous votaries; the veneration of genius, or the devotedness of friendship, has in like manner transferred itself from the individual himself to some object which has been his property or in his possession, and thus acquired _relics_ equally precious.  
Sometimes the term _relics_ is used to denote what _remains_ after the decay or loss of the rest, which further distinguishes it from the word _remains_, which simply signifies what is left.

####remark 
**REMARK, OBSERVATION, COMMENT, NOTE, ANNOTATION, COMMENTARY.**  
_Remark_ (see [notice](entry://notice)), _observation_, and _comment_, in Latin _commentum_, past participle of _comminisce_ (from Latin _com_, a prefix based on _cum_, intensive, and the root found in Latin _memini, memoria_, English _memory_, signifying to remember), are either spoken or written: _note, annotation_ (see [note](entry://note)), _commentary_, a variation of _comment_, are always written. _Remark_ and _observation_, admitting of the same distinction in both cases, have been sufficiently explained in the articles referred to: _comment_ is a species of _remark_ which often loses in good-nature what it gains in seriousness; it is mostly applied to particular persons or cases, and more commonly employed as a mode of censure than of commendation; public speakers and public performers are exposed to all the _comments_ which the vanity, the envy, and ill-nature of self-constituted critics can suggest; but when not employed in personal cases, it serves for explanation: the other terms are used in this sense only, but with certain modifications; the _note_ is most general, and serves to call the attention to particular passages in the text and to illustrate them: _annotations_ and _commentaries_ are more minute; the former being that which is added by way of appendage; the latter being employed in a general form; as the _annotations_ of the Greek scholiasts, and the _commentaries_ on the sacred writings.

####repeat 
**REPEAT, RECITE, REHEARSE, RECAPITULATE.**  
The idea of going over any words or actions is common to all these terms. _Repeal_, from the Latin _re_, again, and _petere_, to seek, or go over again, is the general term, including only the common idea. To _recite, rehearse_, and _recapitulate_ are modes of _repetition_, conveying each some accessory idea. To _recite_ is to _repeat_ in a formal manner; to _rehearse_ (from Latin _re_, again, and Old French _hercer_, to harrow, from _herce_, derived from Latin _hirpex_, a harrow) is to _repeat_ or _recite_ by way of preparation; to _recapitulate_, from _capitulum_, a chapter, is to repeat the chapters or principal heads of any discourse. We _repeat_ both actions and words; we _recite_ only words: we _repeat_ single words or even sounds; we _recite_ always a form of words: we _repeat_ our own words or the words of another; we _recite_ only the words of another; we _repeat_ a name; we _recite_ an ode or a set of verses.  
We _repeat_ for purposes of general convenience; we _recite_ for the convenience or amusement of others; we _rehearse_ for some specific purpose, either for the amusement or instruction of others: we _recapitulate_ for the instruction of others. We _repeat_ that which we wish to be heard; we _recite_ a piece of poetry before a company; we _rehearse_ the piece in private which we are going to recite in public; we _recapitulate_ the general heads of that which we have already spoken in detail. A master must always _repeat_ to his scholars the instruction which he wishes them to remember; Homer is said to have _recited_ his verses in different parts; players _rehearse_ their different parts before they perform in public; ministers _recapitulate_ the leading points in their discourse. To _repeat_ is commonly to use the same words; to _recite_, to _rehearse_, and to _recapitulate_ do not necessarily require any verbal sameness. We _repeat_ literally what we hear spoken by another; but we _recite_ and _rehearse_ events, and we _recapitulate_ in a concise manner what has been uttered in a particular manner. An echo _repeats_ with the greatest possible precision; Homer _recites_ the names of all the Grecian and Trojan leaders, together with the names and account of their countries and the number of the forces which they commanded; Virgil makes Æneas _rehearse_ before Dido and her courtiers the story of the capture of Troy and his own adventures; a judge _recapitulates_ evidence to a jury. 

####repel 
See [refuse](entry://refuse)

####repentance 
**REPENTANCE, PENITENCE, CONTRITION, COMPUNCTION, REMORSE.**  
_Repentance_, from _re_, back, and _pœnitere_, to be sorry, allied to Greek _πείνα_, hunger, signifies thinking one's self wrong for something past: _penitence_, from the same source, signifies simply sorrow for what is amiss. _Contrition_, from the past participle of _conterere_, to rub together, is to bruise, as it were, with sorrow; _compunction_, from _compungere_, to prick thoroughly; and _remorse_, from _remorsus_, the past participle of _remordere_, to have a gnawing pain; and hence to vex, to torment. All express modes of _penitence_ differing in degree and circumstance. _Repentance_ refers more to the change of one's mind with regard to an object, and is properly confined to the time when this change takes place; we, therefore, strictly speaking, _repent_ of a thing but once; we may, however, have _penitence_ for the same thing all our lives. _Repentance_ supposes a change of conduct, at least as long as the sorrow lasts; but the term _penitence is_ confined to the sorrow which the sense of guilt occasions to the offender.  
_Repentance_ is a term of more general application than _penitence_, being employed in respect to offences against men as well as against God; _penitence_, on the other hand, is applicable only to spiritual guilt. _Repentance_ has application to our interests here, _penitence_ to our interests hereafter.  
_Penitence_ is a general sentiment which belongs to all men as offending creatures; but _contrition, compunction_, and _remorse_ are awakened by reflecting on particular offences: _contrition_ is a continued and severe sorrow, appropriate to one who has been in a continued state of peculiar sinfulness: _compunction_ is rather an occasional but sharp sorrow, provoked by a single offence or a moment's reflection; _remorse_ may be temporary, but it is a still sharper pain awakened by some particular offence of peculiar magnitude and atrocity. The prodigal son was a _contrite_ sinner; the brethren of Joseph felt great _compunction_ when they were carried back with their sacks to Egypt; David was struck with _remorse_ for the murder of Uriah. 

####repetition 
**REPETITION, TAUTOLOGY.**  
_Repetition_ is to _tautology_ as the genus to the species, the latter being a species of _repetition._ There may be frequent _repetition_ which is warranted by necessity or convenience; but _tautology_ is that which nowise adds to either the sense or the sound. A _repetition_ may or may not consist of literally the same words; but _tautology_, from the Greek _ταύτό_, the same, and _λογία_, saying, supposes such a sameness in expression as renders the signification the same. In the liturgy of the Church of England there are some _repetitions_ which add to the solemnity of the worship; in most extemporary prayers there is much _tautology_ that destroys the religious effect of the whole.

####reprehension 
**REPREHENSION, REPROOF.**  
Personal blame or censure is implied by both these terms, "but the former is much milder than the latter, and is of less frequent use. By _reprehension_ the personal independence is not so sensibly affected as in the case of _reproof:_ people of all ages and stations, whose conduct is exposed to the investigation of others, are liable to _reprehension;_ but children only, or such as are in a subordinate capacity, are exposed to _reproof. Reprehension_ amounts to little more than passing an unfavorable sentence upon the conduct of another: _reproof_ adds to this words more or less severe. The master of a school may be exposed to the _reprehension_ of the parents for any supposed impropriety: his scholars are subject to his _reproof._

####repress 
**REPRESS, RESTRAIN, SUPPRESS.**  
To repress is to press back or down: to _restrain_ is to strain back or down: the former is the general, the latter the specific, term: we always _repress_ when we _restrain_, but not _vice versa. Repress_ is used mostly for pressing down, so as to keep that inward which wants to make its appearance: _restraint_ is an habitual _repression_ by which a thing is kept in a state of lowness: a person is said to _repress_ his feelings when he does not give them vent either by his words or actions; he is said to _restrain_ his feelings when he never lets them rise beyond a certain pitch: good morals as well as good manners call upon us to _repress_ every unseemly expression of joy in the company of those who are not in a condition to partake of our joy; it is prudence as well as virtue to _restrain_ our appetites by a systematic inhibition, that they may not gain the ascendency.  
To _restrain_ is the act of the individual toward himself; _repress_ may be an act directed to others, as to repress the ardor and impetuosity of youth; to _suppress_, which is to keep under, or keep from appearing or being perceptible, is also said in respect to ourselves or others: as to _repress_ one's feelings; to _suppress_ laughter, sighs, etc.  
So likewise when applied to external objects, as to _repress_ the impetuosity of the combatants, to _suppress_ a rebellion, information, etc. 

####reprieve 
**REPRIEVE, RESPITE.**  
_Reprieve_ is a doublet of _reprove_, from _reprobare_, to try a case a second time, with the implication of rejection, and hence to disallow a sentence. _Respite_ comes through French from Latin _respectum_, English _respect_, and refers to the respect had to a suit.  
The idea of a release from any pressure or burden is common to these terms; but the _reprieve_ is that which is granted; the _respite_ sometimes comes to us in the course of things: we gain a _reprieve_ from any punishment or trouble which threatens us; we gain a _respite_ from any labor or weight that presses upon us. A criminal gains a _reprieve_ when the punishment of death is commuted for that of imprisonment for life; a debtor may be said to obtain a _reprieve_ when, with a prison before his eyes, he gets such indulgence from his creditors as sets him free: there is frequently no _respite_ for persons in a subordinate station, when they fall into the hands of a hard taskmaster; Sisyphus is feigned by the poets to have been condemned to the toil of perpetually rolling a stone up a hill as fast as it rolled back, from which toil he had no _respite._

The idea of contemptuous or angry treatment, of others is common to all these terms; but _reproach_ is the general, _contumely_ and _obloquy_ are the particular terms. _Reproach_ (see [blame](entry://blame)) is either deserved or undeserved; the name of Puritan is applied as a term of _reproach_ to such as affect greater purity than others; the name of Christian is a name of _reproach_ in Turkey; _contumely_, from _contumeo_, that is, _contra tumeo_, signifying to swell up against, is always undeserved; it is the insolent swelling of a worthless person against merit in distress; the early Christians were exposed to the _contumely_ of Nero; _obloquy_, from _ob_ and _loquor_, signifying to speak against or to the disparagement of any one, is always supposed to be deserved or otherwise; it is applicable to those whose conduct has rendered them objects of general censure, and whose name, therefore, has almost become a_ reproach._ A man who uses his power only to oppress those who are connected with him will naturally and deservedly bring upon himself much _obloquy._

**REPROACHFUL, ABUSIVE, SCURRILOUS.** — _Reproachful_, or full of _reproach_, when applied to persons, signifies full of _reproaches;_ when to things, deserving of _reproach: abusive_, or full of _abuse_, is applied only to the person, signifying using _abuse: scurrilous_, in Latin _scurrilis_, from _scurra_, signifying a buffoon or saucy jester, is employed as an epithet either for persons or things in the sense of using _scurrility._ The conduct of a person is _reproachful_ inasmuch as it provokes or is entitled to the _reproaches_ of others; the language of a person is _reproachful_ when it abounds in _reproaches_ or partakes of the nature of a _reproach:_ a person is _abusive_ who indulges himself in _abuse_ or _abusive_ language: and he is _scurrilous_ who adopts _scurrility_ or _scurrilous_ language. When applied to the same object, whether to the person or to the thing, they rise in sense; the _reproachful_ is less than the _abusive_, and this less than the _scurrilous;_ the _reproachful_ is sometimes warranted by the provocation; but the _abusive_ and _scurrilous_ are always unwarrantable; _reproachful_ language may be, and generally is, consistent with decency and propriety of speech: _abusive_ and _scurrilous_ language is an outrage against the laws of good-breeding, if not of morality. A parent may sometimes find it necessary to address an unruly son in _reproachful_ terms; or one friend may adopt a _reproachful_ tone to another; none, however, but the lowest orders of men, and those only when their anger is awakened, will descend to _abusive_ or _scurrilous_ language. 

####reprobate 
**REPROBATE, CONDEMN.**  
To _reprobate_ is much stronger than to _condemn_, but of less frequent application: we always _condemn_ when we _reprobate_, but not _vice versa:_ to _reprobate_ is to _condemn_ in strong and reproachful language. We _reprobate_ all measures which tend to sow discord in society and to loosen the ties by which men are bound to each other; we _condemn_ all disrespectful language toward _superiors._ We _reprobate_ only the thing; we _condemn_ the person also: any act of disobedience in a child cannot be too strongly _reprobated;_ a person must expect to be _condemned_ when he involves himself in embarrassments through his own imprudence.

####reserve 
**RESERVE, RESERVATION.**  
_Reserve_ and _reservation_, from _servare_, to keep, and _re_, back, both signify a keeping back, but differ as to the object and the circumstances of the action. _Reserve_ is applied in a good sense to anything natural or moral which is kept back to be employed for a better purpose on a future occasion; _reservation_ is an artful keeping back for selfish purposes: there is a prudent _reserve_ which every man ought to keep in his discourse with a stranger; equivocators deal altogether in mental _reservation._  
**RESERVE, RETAIN.** — _Reserve_, from the Latin prefix _re_ and _servare_, to keep, signifies to keep back. _Retain_, from _tenere_, to hold, signifies to hold back: they in some measure, therefore, have the same distinction as keep and hold.  
To _reserve_ is an act of more specific design; we _reserve_ that which is the particular object of our choice: to _retain_ is a simple exertion of our power; we _retain_ that which has once come in our possession. To _reserve_ is employed only for that which is allowable; we _reserve_ a thing, that is, keep it back with care for some future purpose: to _retain_ is often an unlawful act; a debtor frequently _retains_ in his hands the money which he has borrowed.  
To _reserve_, whether in the proper or improper application, is employed only as the act of a conscious agent; to _retain_ is often the act of an unconscious agent: we _reserve_ what we have to say on a subject until a more suitable opportunity offers; the mind _retains_ the impressions of external objects by its peculiar faculty, the memory; certain substances are said to _retain_ the color with which they have been dyed.

####rest 
**REST, REMAINDER, REMNANT, RESIDUE.**  
_Rest_ is the substantive based on the Latin _restore_, compounded of _re_ and _stare_, to stand behind, in this case, though not in the former (see [ease](entry://ease)), signifying what stands or remains back. _Remainder_ literally signifies what remains after the first part is gone. _Remnant_ is but a variation of _remainder;_ it comes from the present participle of _remanere_, whence _remainder_ is derived. _Residue_, from the neuter of the Latin adjective _residuus_, based on _re_, back, and _sedere_, to sit, signifies likewise what remains back.  
All these terms express that part which is separated from the other and left distinct: _rest_ is the most general, both in sense and application; the others have a more specific meaning and use: the _rest_ may be either that which is left behind by itself or that which is set apart as a distinct portion: the _remainder, remnant_, and _residue_ are the quantities which remain when the other parts are gone. The _rest_ is said of any part, large or small; but the _remainder_ commonly regards the smaller part which has been left after the greater part has been taken. A person may be said to sell some and give away the _rest:_ when a number of hearty persons sit down to a meal, the _remainder_ of the provisions, after all have been satisfied, will not be considerable. _Rest_ is applied either to persons or things; _remainder_ only to things: some were of that opinion, but the _rest_ did not agree to it: the _remainder_ of the paper was not worth preserving.  
_Remnant_, from the Latin participle stem _remanent_, remaining, is a species of _remainder_ after the greater part has been consumed or wasted: it is, therefore, properly a small _remainder_, as a _remnant_ of cloth; and metaphorically applied to persons, as a _remnant_ of Israel. A _residue_ is another species of _remainder_, which resides or keeps back after a distribution or division of anything has taken place; as the _residue_ of a person's property, that which remains undisposed of.

####restitution 
See [restoration](entry://restoration)

####restoration 
**RESTORATION, RESTITUTION, REPARATION, AMENDS.**  
_Restoration_ is employed in the ordinary application of the verb _restore: restitution_, from the Latin verb_ restituere_, is employed simply in the sense of malting good that which has been unjustly taken or which ought to be _restored. Restoration_ of property may be made by any one, whether it be the person taking it or not: _restitution_ is supposed to be made by him who has been guilty of the injustice. The dethronement of a king may be the work of one set of men and his _restoration_ that of another; it is the moral duty of every individual who has committed any sort of injustice to another to make _restitution_ to the utmost of his power.  
_Restitution_ and _reparation_ are both employed in the sense of undoing that which has been done to the injury of another; but the former connotes only injuries that affect the property, and _reparation_ those which affect a person in various ways. He who is guilty of theft or fraud must make _restitution_ by either _restoring_ the stolen article or its full value: he who robs another of his good name, or does any injury to his person, has it not in his power so easily to make _reparation. Reparation_ and _amends_ (see [compensation](entry://compensation)) are both employed in cases where some mischief or loss is sustained; but the term _reparation_ comprehends the idea of the act of _repairing_, as well as the thing by which we _repair; amends_ is employed only for the thing that will _amend_ or make better: hence we speak of the _reparation_ of an injury; but of the _amends_ by itself. The term _reparation_ comprehends all kinds of injuries, particularly those of a serious nature; the _amends_ is applied only to matters of inferior importance. It is impossible to make _reparation_ for taking away the life of another. It is easy to make _amends_ to any one for the loss of a day's pleasure.

**RESTORE, RETURN, REPAY.** — _Restore_ comes from Latin _restaurare_, to set up again. _Return_ comes from Latin _re_, again, and Low Latin _tornare_, to turn a lathe. For _repay_ see [pay](entry://pay).  
The common idea of all these terms is that of giving back. What we _restore_ to another may or may not be the same as what we have taken; justice requires that it should be an equivalent in value, so as to prevent the individual from being in any degree a sufferer; what we _return_ and _repay_ ought to be precisely the same as we have received: the former in application to general objects, the latter in application only to pecuniary matters. We _restore_ upon a principle of equity: we _return_ upon a principle of justice and honor; we _repay_ upon a principle of undeniable right. We cannot always claim that which ought to be _restored;_ but we cannot only claim, but enforce the claim in regard to what is to be _returned_ or _repaid:_ an honest man will be scrupulous not to take anything from another without _restoring_ to him its full value. Whatever we have borrowed we ought to _return;_ and when it is money which we have obtained, we ought to _repay_ it with punctuality. We _restore_ to many as well as to one, to communities as well as to individuals; a king is _restored_ to his crown; or one nation _restores_ a territory to another; we _return_ and _repay_ not only individually, but personally and particularly: we _return_ a book to its owner; we _repay_ a sum of money to him from whom it was borrowed.  
_Restore_ and _return_ may be employed in their improper applications as respects the moral state of persons and things; as a king restores a courtier to his favor, or a physician _restores_ his patient to health: we _return_ a favor; we _return_ an answer or a compliment. _Repay_ may be figuratively employed in regard to moral objects, as an ungrateful person _repays_ kindnesses with reproaches. 

####restrain 
**RESTRAIN, RESTRICT.**  
_Restrain_ (see [coerce](entry://coerce)) and _restrict_ are but variations of the same Latin verb _restringere:_ the first from the infinitive, the second from its past participle, _restrictus;_ but they have acquired a distinct acceptation: the former applies to the desires as well as the outward conduct: the latter only to the outward conduct. A person _restrains_ his inordinate appetite; or he is _restrained_ by others from doing mischief: he is _restricted_ in the use of his money. To _restrain_ is an act of power; but to _restrict_ is an act of authority or law: the will or the actions of a child are _restrained_ by the parent, but a patient is _restricted_ in his diet by a physician, or any body of people may be _restricted_ by laws.

####retaliation 
**RETALIATION, REPRISAL.**  
_Retaliation_, from _retaliate_, in Latin _retaliatum_, participle of _retaliare_, compounded of _re_ and _taliare_, to requite in kind (the etymology of _talis_ is far from certain), signifies so much again, or like for like. _Reprisal_, a word much used in connection with the European war, is a verbal substantive based on _repris_, past participle of the French verb _reprendre_, in Latin _reprehendere_, to take again, signifies to take in return for what has been taken. The idea of making another suffer in return for the suffering he has occasioned is common to these terms; but the former is employed in ordinary cases; the latter mostly in regard to a state of warfare or to active hostilities. A trick practiced upon another in return for a trick is a _retaliation;_ but a _reprisal_ always extends to the capture of something from another, in return for what has been taken. _Retaliation_ is very frequently employed in the good sense for what passes innocently between friends: _reprisal_ has always an unfavorable sense. Goldsmith's poem, entitled "Retaliation, " was written for the purpose of _retaliating_ on his friends the joke that they had played upon him; when the quarrels of individuals break through the restraints of the law and lead to acts of violence to each other's property, _reprisals_ are made alternately by both parties. 

####retard 
**RETARD, HINDER.**  
To _retard_, from the Latin _tardus_, slow, signifying to make slow, is applied to the movements of any object forward, as in the Latin "Impetum inimici tardare": to _hinder_ (see that word) is applied to the person moving or acting: we _retard_ or make slow the progress of any scheme toward completion; we _hinder_ or keep back the person who is completing the scheme: we _retard_ a thing, therefore, often by _hindering_ the person; but we frequently _hinder_ a person without expressly _retarding_, and, on the contrary, the thing is _retarded_ without the person being _hindered._ The publication of a work is sometimes _retarded_ by the _hindrances_ which an author meets with in bringing it to a conclusion; but a work may be _retarded_ through the idleness of printers, and a variety of other causes which are independent of any _hindrance._ So in like manner a person may be _hindered_ in going to his place of destination; but we do not say that he is _retarded_, because it is only the execution of an object and not the simple movements of the person which are _retarded._  
To _retard_ stops the completion of an object only for a time, but to _hinder_ is to stop it altogether.

####retort 
**RETORT, REPARTEE.**  
_Retort_, from re, back, and _torquere_, to turn, signifying to twist or turn back, is an ill-natured reply: _repartee_, a misspelling of _repartie_, feminine of the past participle of the French _repartir_, from Latin _re_, again, and _par tire_, to divide, hence to lunge, is to answer thrust with thrust, cut with cut. The _retort_ is always in answer to a censure, for which one returns a like censure; the _repartee_ is commonly in answer to the wit of another, where one returns wit for wit. In the acrimony of disputes it is common to hear _retort_ upon _retort_ to an endless extent; the liveliness of discourse is sometimes greatly increased by the quick _repartee_ of those who take part in it.

####retribution 
**RETRIBUTION, REQUITAL.**  
_Retribution_, from re _tribuere_, to bestow, signifying a bestowing back or giving in return, is a particular term; _requital_ (see [reward](entry://reward)) is general: the _retribution_ comes from Providence; _requital_ is the act of man: _retribution_ is by way of punishment; _requital_ is mostly by way of reward: _retribution_ is not always dealt out to every man according to his deeds; it is a poor _requital_ for one who has done a kindness to be abused. 

####retrieve 
See [recover](entry://recover)

####retrospect 
**RETROSPECT, REVIEW, SURVEY.**  
A _retrospect_, which signifies, literally, looking back, from _retro_, behind, and _spicere_, to behold or cast an eye upon, is always taken of that which is past and distant; _review_, which is a view repeated, may be taken of that which is present and before us; every _retrospect_ is a species of _review_, but every _review_ is not a _retrospect._ We take a _retrospect_ of our past life in order to draw salutary reflections from all that we have done and suffered; we take a _review_ or a second view of any particular circumstance which is passing before us, in order to regulate our present conduct. The _retrospect_ goes farther by virtue of the mind's power to reflect on itself and to recall all past images to itself; the _review_ may go forward by the exercise of the senses on external objects. The historian takes a _retrospect_ of all the events which have happened within a given period; the journalist takes a _review_ of all the events that are passing within the time in which he is living.  
The _review_ may be said of the past as well as the present; it is a _view_ not only of what is, but what has been; the _survey_, which is a looking over at once, from the French _sur_, upon, and Old French _veër_, for _voir_, to see, is entirely confined to the present; it is a _view_ only of that which is, and is taken for some particular purpose. We take a _review_ of what we have already _viewed_, in order to get a more correct insight into it; we take a _survey_ of a thing in all its parts, in order to get a comprehensive view of it, in order to examine it in all its bearings. A general occasionally takes a _review_ of all his army; he takes a _survey_ of the fortress which he is going to besiege or attack. 

####return 
**RETURN, REVERT.**  
_Return_ is the English, and _revert_ the Latin: _return_ is therefore used in ordinary cases to denote the coming back to any point of time or place; as to _return_ home, or to _return_ at a certain hour, or to apply one's self again to the same business or employment; as to _return_ to one's writing: to _revert_ is to throw back with one's mind to any object; we may, therefore, say, to _return_ or _revert_ to any intellectual object, with this distinction, that to _return_ is to go back to the point where one left off treating of any subject; to _revert_ is simply to carry one's mind back to the same object. As an act of an unconscious agent, _return_ is used as before.  
_Revert_ signifies either to fall back into the same state or to return by reflection to the same object; all things _revert_ to their primitive order and regularity.

####revile 
**REVILE, VILIFY.**  
_Revile_, from the Latin prefix re and old French _aviler_, to make vile, built on the Latin _vilis_, cheap, worthless, signifies to reflect upon a person, or retort upon him that which is vile: to _vilify_ signifies to make a thing vile, that is, to set it forth as vile. To _revile_ is a personal act; it is addressed directly to the object of offence, and is addressed for the purpose of making the person vile in his own eyes: to _vilify_ is an indirect attack which serves to make the object appear vile in the eyes of others. _Revile_ is said only of persons, for persons only are _reviled;_ but to _vilify_ is said of persons as well as things. To _revile_ is uncharitable: to _vilify_ is seldom justifiable, for we cannot _vilify_ without using improper language; it is seldom resorted to except as a manifestation of ill-nature. 

####revisal 
**REVISAL, REVISION, REVIEW.**  
_Revisal, revision_, and _review_ all come from the Latin _videre_, to see, and signify looking back upon a thing or looking at it again: the terms _revised_ and _revision_ are, however, mostly employed in regard to what is written; _review_ is used for things in general. The _revisal_ of a book is the work of the author, or of a reviser, for the purposes of correction: the _review_ of a book is the work of the critic, for the purpose of estimating its value. _Revisal_ and _revision_ differ neither in sense nor application, that except the former is more frequently employed abstractedly from the object _revised_ and _revision_ mostly in conjunction: whoever wishes his work to be correct will not spare a _revisal;_ the _revision_ of classical books ought to be intrusted only to men of profound erudition.  
See also [retrospect](entry://retrospect)

####revive 
**REVIVE, REFRESH, RENOVATE, RENEW.**  
_Revive_, from the Latin _vivere_, to live, signifies to bring to life again; to _refresh_, to make fresh again; to _renew_ and _renovate_, to make new again. The restoration of things to their primitive state is the common idea included in these terms; the difference consists in their application. _Revive, refresh_, and _renovate_ are applied to animal bodies; _revive_ expressing the return of motion and spirits to one who was for the time lifeless; _refresh_ expressing the return of vigor to one in whom it has been diminished; the air _revives_ one who is faint; a cool breeze _refreshes_ one who is affected by the heat. _Revive_ and _refresh_ connote only the temporary state of a body; _renovate_ the permanent state, that is, the health or powers of a body; one is _revived_ and _refreshed_ after partial exhaustion; one's health is _renovated_ after having been considerably impaired.  
_Revive_ is applied likewise in the moral sense; _refresh_ and _renovate_ mostly in the proper sense; _renew_ only in the applied sense. A discussion is said to be _revived_ or a report to be _revived;_ a clamor is said to be _renewed_ or entreaties to be _renewed:_ customs are _revived_ which have long lain dormant and, as it were, dead; practices are _renewed_ that have ceased for a time.

####riches 
**RICHES, WEALTH, OPULENCE, AFFLUENCE.**  
_Riches_ comes from Old French _richesse_, wealth, from Middle High German _riche_, which is the same word as Anglo-Saxon _ric. Wealth_, Middle English _welthe_, extended from _weal_, prosperity, which is allied to _well. Opulence_, from the stem of the Latin _opes_, riches, denotes the state of having riches. _Affluence_, from the Latin _ad_, to, and _fluere_, to flow, denotes either the act of riches flowing in to a person or the state of having things flowing in.  
_Riches_ is a general term denoting any considerable share of property, but without immediate reference to a possessor; whatever serves to make one rich is denominated riches, inasmuch as it supplies us with the means of getting what is really good; _wealth_ and the other terms refer to outward possessions.  
_Riches_ is a condition opposed to poverty; the whole world is divided into _rich_ and poor, and _riches_ are distributed in different degrees; but _wealth, opulence_, and _affluence_ all denote a considerable share of _riches: wealth_ is a positive and substantial share of this world's goods, but particularly of money or the precious commodities; it may be taken in the abstract or in application to individuals: _opulence_ consists of any large share in possessions or property generally, as houses, lands, goods, and chattels, and is applicable to the present and actual condition of the individual. _Affluence_ is a term peculiarly applicable to the fluctuating condition of things which flow in in great quantities to a person. We speak of _riches_ as to their effects upon men's minds and manners; it is not every one who knows how to use them: we speak of _wealth_ as it raises a man in the scale of society and contributes to his weal or well-being: we speak of _opulence_ as the present actually flourishing state of the individuals; and of _affluence_ as the temporary condition. _Wealth_ and _opulence_ are applied to communities as well as individuals. 

####ridicule 
**RIDICULE, SATIRE, IRONY, SARCASM.**  
_Ridicule_ (see [deride](entry://deride)) has simple laughter in it; _satire_ comes from _satura lanx_, a full dish, a dish of mixed ingredients, indicating a poem full of topical and personal hits: the former is employed in matters of a trifling nature; but _satire_ is employed either in personal or grave matters. _Irony_, in Greek _ειρωνεία_, from _είρων_, a dissembler who says less than he thinks or means, is disguised _satire;_ an _ironist_ seems to praise that which he really means to condemn. _Sarcasm_, from the Greek _σαρκασμός_, a sneer, and _σαρκάζειν_, to sneer, both based on _σάρξ_, flesh, signifying biting or nipping _satire_, so, as it were, to tear the flesh, is bitter and personal _satire;_ all the others may be successfully and properly employed to expose folly and vice; but _sarcasm_, which is the indulgence only of personal resentment, is never justifiable.  
See also [laugh](entry://laugh)

####right 
**RIGHT, JUST, FIT, PROPER.**  
_Right_, from Anglo-Saxon _riht_, signifying upright, not leaning to one side or the other, standing as it ought, is here the general term: the others express modes of _right._ The _right_ and wrong are defined by the written will of God, or are written in our hearts according to the original disposition of our nature: the _just_, in Latin _justus_, from _jus_, law, signifying according to a rule of right, and the unjust, are determined by the written laws of men; _the fit_ and _proper_, in Latin _proprius_, signifying belonging to a given specific rule, are determined by the established principles of society.  
Between the _right_ and the wrong there are no gradations: a thing cannot be more _right_ or more wrong; whatever is _right_ is not wrong, and whatever is wrong is not _right:_ the _just_ and unjust, _proper_ and improper, _fit_ and unfit, on the contrary, have various shades and degrees that are not so easily definable by any forms of speech or written rules.  
The _right_ and wrong depend upon no circumstances; what is once _right_ or wrong is always _right_ or wrong, but the _just_ or unjust, _proper_ or improper, are relatively so according to the circumstances of the case: it is a _just_ rule for every man to have that which is his own; but what is just to the individual may be unjust to society. It is _proper_ for every man to take charge of his own concerns; but it would be improper for a man in an unsound state of mind to undertake such a charge. _Right_ is applicable to all matters, important or otherwise; _just_ is employed mostly in matters of essential interest; _proper_ is rather applicable to the minor concerns of life. Everything that is done may be characterized as _right_ or wrong: everything done to others may be measured by the rule of _just_ or unjust: in our social intercourse, as well as in our private transactions, _fitness_ and _propriety_ must always be consulted. As Christians, we desire to do that which is _right_ in the sight of God and man; as members of society, we wish to be _just_ in our dealings; as rational and intelligent beings, we wish to do what is _fit_ and _proper_ in every action, however trivial.  
See also [straight](entry://straight)  
**RIGHT, CLAIM, PRIVILEGE.** — _Right_ signifies in this sense what it is _right_ for one to possess, which is, in fact, a word of large meaning: for since the _right_ and the wrong depend upon indeterminable questions, the _right_ of having is equally indeterminable in some cases with every other species of _right._ A _claim_ (see [ask](entry://ask)) is a species of _right_ to have that which is in the hands of another; the _right_ to ask another for it. The _privilege_ is a species of _right_ peculiar to particular individuals or bodies.  
_Right_, in its full sense, is altogether an abstract thing which is independent of human laws and regulations; _claims_ and _privileges_ are altogether connected with the laws of society. Liberty, in the general sense, is an inalienable _right_ which belongs to man as a rational and responsible agent; it is not a _claim_, for it is set above all question and all condition: nor is it a _privilege_, for it cannot be exclusively granted to one being nor unconditionally be taken away from another.  
Between _right_ and power there is often as wide a distinction as between truth and falsehood; we have often a _right_ to do that which we have no power to do; and the power to do that which we have no _right_ to do: slaves have a _right_ to the freedom which is enjoyed by creatures of the same species as themselves, but they have not the power to use this freedom as others do. In England men have the power of thinking for themselves as they please; but by the abuse which they make of this power we see that in many cases they have not the _right_, unless we admit the contradiction that men have a _right_ to do what is wrong; they have the power, therefore, of exercising this _right_ only because no other person has the power of controlling them. We have often a _claim_ to a thing which is not in our power to substantiate; and, on the other hand, _claims_ are set up in cases which are totally unfounded on any _right. Privileges_ are _rights_ granted to individuals, depending either upon the will of the grantor, or the circumstances of the receiver, or both; _privileges_ are therefore partial _rights_ transferable at the discretion of persons individually or collectively.

####ripe 
**RIPE, MATURE.**  
_Ripe_ is the English (from Anglo-Saxon _ripe_, fit for _reaping), mature_ the Latin word: the former has a universal application both proper and improper; the latter has mostly an improper application. The idea of completion in growth is simply designated by the former term; the idea of moral perfection, as far, at least, as it is attainable, is marked by the latter: fruit is _ripe_ when it requires no more sustenance from the parent stock; a judgment is _mature_ which requires no more time and knowledge to render it perfect or fitted for exercise: in the same manner a project may be said to be _ripe_ for execution or a people _ripe_ for revolt; and, on the contrary, reflection may be said to be _mature_ to which sufficiency of time has been given, and age may be said to be _mature_ which has attained the highest pitch of perfection. _Ripeness_ is, however, not always a good quality; but _maturity_ is always a perfection: the _ripeness_ of some fruit diminishes the excellence of its flavor: there are some fruits which have no flavor until they come to _maturity._

####rise 
**RISE, ISSUE, EMERGE.**  
TO _rise_ (see [arise](entry://arise)) may either refer to open or enclosed spaces; issue and _emerge_ (see **emergency** under [exigency](entry://exigency)) have both a reference to some confined body: a thing may either _rise_ in a body, without a body, or out of a body; but it issues and _emerges_ out of a body. A thing may either rise in a plain or a wood; it issues out of a wood: it may either _rise_ in water or out of the water; it _emerges_ from the water; that which _rises_ out of a thing comes into view by becoming higher: in this manner an air balloon might _rise_ out of a wood; that which issues comes from the very depths of a thing, and, as it were, comes out as a part of it; but that which _emerges_ proceeds from the thing in which it has been, as it were, concealed. Hence, in the moral application, a person is said to rise in life without a reference to his former condition; but he _emerges_ from obscurity: color rises in the face; but words _issue_ from the mouth.

####rot 
**ROT, PUTREFY, CORRUPT.**  
The dissolution of bodies by an internal process is implied by all these terms: but the first two are applied to natural bodies only; the last to all bodies, natural and moral. _Rot_ is the strongest of all these terms; it denotes the last stage in the progress of dissolution: _putrefy_ (the modern variant of _putrefy_, based on _putrid)_ expresses the progress toward rottenness; and _corruption_ the commencement. After fruit has arrived at its maturity or proper state of ripeness it _rots:_ meat which is kept too long _putrefies:_ there is a tendency in all bodies to _corruption;_ iron and wood _corrupt_ with time; whatever is made, or done, or wished by men is equally liable to be _corrupt_ or to grow _corrupt._

####roundness 
**ROUNDNESS, ROTUNDITY.**  
_Roundness_ and _rotundity_ both come from the Latin _rotundus_ and _rota_, a wheel, which is a perfectly round body: the former term is, however, applied to all objects in general; the latter only to solid bodies which are round in all directions: one speaks of the _roundness_ of a circle, the _roundness_ of the moon, the _roundness_ of a tree; but the _rotundity_ of a man's body which projects in a _round_ form in all directions, and the _rotundity_ of a full cheek or the _rotundity_ of a turnip.

####route 
**ROUTE, ROAD, COURSE.**  
_Route_ comes through the French from the adjective of the Latin phrase, _via rupta_, or "broken road. " _Road_ comes from the Anglo-Saxon _ridan_, to ride, signifying the place where one rides, as _course_, from the Latin _cursus_ (see [course](entry://course)), signifies the place where one walks or runs.  
_Route_ is to _road_ as the species to the genus: a _route_ is a circular kind of _road;_ it is chosen as the circuitous direction toward a certain point, and may consist of more than one _road_ successively: the _road_ may be either in a direct or indirect line; the _route_ is always indirect: the _route_ is chosen only by horsemen or those who go to a considerable distance, as those who choose the _"route_ to India"; the _road_ may be chosen for the shortest distance; the _route_ and _road_ are pursued in their beaten and frequented track; the _course_ is often chosen in the unbeaten track: an army or a company go a certain _route_, foot-passengers are seen to take a certain course over fields: _course_ often implies circular completion, as, the sun runs its _course._

####rove 
See [wander](entry://wander)

####royal 
**ROYAL, REGAL, KINGLY.**  
_Royal_ and _regal_, both from the adjective _regalis_, based on Latin _rex_, a king, though of foreign origin, have obtained more general application than the corresponding English term _kingly. Royal_ signifies belonging to a king, in its most general sense; _regal_ signifies appertaining to a king, in its particular application; _kingly_ signifies properly like a king. A _royal_ carriage, a _royal_ residence, a _royal_ couple, a _royal_ salute, _royal_ authority, all designate the general and ordinary appurtenances to a king: _regal_ government, _regal_ state, _regal_ power, _regal_ dignity, denote the peculiar properties of a king: _kingly_ always implies what is becoming a king, or after the manner of a king; a _kingly_ crown is such as a king ought to wear; a _kingly_ mien that which is after the manner of a king. 

####rub 
**RUB, CHAFE, FRET, GALL.**  
_Rub_, Middle English _rubben_, is of Celtic origin; it is not allied to German _reiben_, from which _rive_ is taken; it is the generic term, expressing simply the act of bodies moving in contact with and against others; to _chafe_ (from Old French _chaufer_, from Low Latin _calefcare_, a late form of the classical _calfacere_, to make hot) signifies to _rub_ a thing until it is heated: to _fret_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _frétan_, compounded of _for_, intensive prefix, and _elan_, meaning to eat away; to _gall_ is a different word from the noun _gall_, and corresponds probably to Latin _galla_, a gall-nut, oak-apple — hence a tumor, a skin affection; hence to rub or itch. Things are _rubbed_ sometimes for purposes of convenience; but they are _chafed, fretted_, and _galled_ injuriously: the skin is liable to _chafe_ from any violence; leather _will fret_ from the motion of a carriage; when the skin is once broken animals will become _galled_ by a continuance of the friction. These terms are likewise used in the moral sense, to denote the actions of things on the mind, where the distinction is clearly kept up: we meet with _rubs_ from the opposing sentiments of others; the angry humors are _chafed;_ the mind is _fretted_ and made sore by the frequent repetition of small troubles and vexations; pride is _galled_ by humiliations and severe degradations.

####rummage 
**RUMMAGE, RANSACK.**  
These two words both signify to look for something. _Rummage_, compounded of French suffix _age_ and Dutch _ruim_, a ship's hold, allied to _room._ It meant to stow away and then to search among things stowed away. _Ransack_ comes from Scandinavian _rann_, a house, and _sak_, a root allied to seek, signifying to search a house thoroughly and carry away. _Ransack_ signifies a thorough _rummaging._ The difference between the two words is mainly one of degree. 

####rumor 
See [fame](entry://fame)

####rupture 
**RUPTURE, FRACTURE, FRACTION.**  
_Rupture_, from _ruptura_, the feminine of the future participle of _rumpere_, to break or burst, and _fracture_ or _fraction,_ similarly derived from _frangere_, to break, denote different kinds of breaking, according to the objects to which the action is applied. Soft substances may suffer a _rupture;_ as the _rupture_ of a blood-vessel; hard substances a _fracture_, as the _fracture_ of a bone.  
_Fraction_ is used only in respect to broken numbers, as the _fraction_ of a unit.  
_Rupture_ is also used in an improper application; as the _rupture_ of a treaty. 

####rural 
**RURAL, RUSTIC.**  
Although both these terms, from the Latin _rus_, country, signify belonging to the country, yet the former, from the genitive stem _ruris_, is used in a good, and the latter in a bad or an indifferent, sense. _Rural_ applies to all country objects except man; it is, therefore, always connected with the charms of nature: _rustic_ applies only to persons or what is personal, in the country, and is, therefore, always associated with the want of culture. _Rural_ scenery is always interesting; but the _rustic_ manners of the peasants have frequently too much that is uncultivated and rude in them to be agreeable; a _rural_ habitation may be fitted for persons in a higher station; but a _rustic_ cottage is adapted only for the poorer inhabitants of the country. See also [countryman](entry://countryman)

####sabbath 
**SABBATH, SUNDAY.**  
The term _Sabbath_, from the Hebrew _shabbáth_, to rest, through French _sabbat_, implies a sacred day of rest from customary occupations, the institution of which, under the name of the _seventh day_, is first mentioned in Genesis 11:2-3. Always in the Gospels and as a rule in the other books, _Sabbath_ means the _seventh day_ of the week.  
Distinctions between the _Sabbath_ and _Sunday_ were at one time very sharply drawn, the _Sabbath_ being considered a purely Jewish term, and _Sunday_, otherwise called the _Lord's Day_, a Christian one; but most of the old contentions were long ago abandoned. The elder Disraeli is authority for the statement that the term _Sabbath_ meant Saturday in the Middle Ages, and that it was first used in England for _Sunday_ in 1554.  
Both Jews and Christians observe the _seventh day_ of the week, but from a different start, the former recognizing Saturday as their _Sabbath_ and the latter the following day as their _Sunday._

####sack 
**SACK, DESPOIL, DEVASTATE.**  
_Sack_, in French _sac_, waste or ruin, may be derived from Latin _saccus_, a bag or sack for carrying away things. _Despoil_ comes from Latin _spoliare_, based on _spolium_, a skin stripped off, referring to the dress of a dead warrior. _Devastate_, from _devastare_, based on Latin _vastus_, signifying large, empty space, means to lay waste. _Sack_ is a stronger word than _despoil._ It means to go through a conquered territory and carry off everything of value. _Despoil_ means to strip off something valuable, but it does not imply such thorough and wholesale destruction. _Devastate_ means literally to lay waste, and refers not merely to the carrying away of valuables, but to the utter destruction of everything. We may speak of a city _devastated_ by fire, or a country _devastated_ by storm — so that the word has a wider application than _sack_ and does not refer merely to warfare. _Despoil_ may refer to the action of individuals. An unscrupulous lawyer may _despoil_ a widow of the property left to her, etc. But _sack_ is applied specifically to the treatment of captured territory in warfare.

####sacrilegious 
**SACRILEGIOUS, IRREVERENT, DESECRATING.**  
_Sacrilegious_, from Latin _sacrilegium_ (based on the crude stem _sacri_ and _legere_, to gather up and steal sacred things), the robbing of a temple, is a much more positive word than _irreverent_, which simply means not _reverent_ (for the derivation see [adore](entry://adore)); but it is a less positive word than _desecrating_, from Latin _de_, not, and _sacer_, sacred, which means depriving of sacredness, and has a more extended application. _Sacrilegious_ means positively _irreverent_, implying an _irreverence_ that reveals itself in a distinct speech or act which shows a lack of regard for things held holy. _Desecrating_ means not merely a positive expression of the disregard for things sacred, but an expression of such violence that it destroys the sacred character. _Irreverent_ applies to an attitude of mind, _sacrilegious_ to manner and speech, _desecrating_ to action, though these distinctions are not clearly observed. _(Sacrilegious_ is often mispronounced, even by educated persons, as sacrilegious.)

####safe 
**SAFE, SECURE.**  
_Safe, in_ Latin _salvus_, to be tranquil, implies exemption from harm or the danger of harm; _secure_ (see [certain](entry://certain)) the exemption from danger: a person may be _safe_ or saved in the midst of a fire, if he be untouched by the fire; but he is, in such a case, the reverse of _secure._ In the sense of exemption from danger, _safety_ expresses much less than _security:_ we may be _safe_ without using any particular measures; but none can reckon on any degree of _security_ without great precaution: a person may be very _safe_ on the top of a coach in the daytime; but if he wishes to _secure_ himself, at night, from falling off, he must be fastened.

####sage 
**SAGE, SAGACIOUS, SAPIENT.**  
_Sage_ and _sagacious_ come from different Latin words, despite their similarity of form and meaning, _sage_ being derived ultimately from Latin _sapere_, to be wise; _sagacious_ from _sagax_, connected with _sagire_, to perceive by the senses. _Sapient_ is derived from the present participle of _sapere._  
The first of these terms has a good sense, in application to men, to denote the faculty of discerning immediately, which is the fruit of experience, and very similar to that _sagacity_ in animals which instinctively perceives a thing without the deductions of reason; _sapient_ is now employed only in regard to animals which are trained to particular arts; its use, therefore, in respect to human beings, is mostly in the lofty or burlesque style.

####sake 
**SAKE, ACCOUNT, REASON, PURPOSE, END.**  
These terms are all employed adverbially, to modify or connect propositions; hence one says, for his _sake_, on his _account_, for this _reason_, for this _purpose_, and to this _end. Sake_, from Anglo-Saxon _sacu_, strife, a side in a strife, hence a cause, is mostly said of persons; what is done for a person's _sake_ is the same as in behalf of his cause; one may, however, say in regard to things, for the _sake_ of good order, implying what good order requires: _account_ is indifferently employed for persons or things; what is done on a person's _account_ is done in his behalf and for his interest; what is done on _account_ of indisposition is done in consequence of it, the indisposition being the cause: _purpose_ is properly personal and refers to that which a person _purposes_ to himself; if we ask, therefore, for what _purpose_ a thing is done, it may be to know something of some other person's character and principles: _reason_ and _end_ are applied to things only: we speak of the _reason_ as the thing that justifies: we explain why we do a tiling when we say we do it for this or that _reason;_ we speak of the _end_ by way of explaining the nature of the thing: the propriety of a measure cannot be known unless we know what _end_ it will answer. 

####salary 
See **allowance** under [allow](entry://allow)

####salient 
**SALIENT, OUTSTANDING.**  
Both of these words indicate that which is a noticeable or prominent feature of something. _Outstanding_ is really just an English translation of _salient_, from Latin _satire_, to leap, hence to stand out; and the difference between them is mainly the difference usually found between words of English and Latin derivation. _Outstanding_ suggests the picture more clearly. The _outstanding_ feature of an occurrence is that which strikes the attention most vividly, which stands out from the rest. _Salient_ does not so clearly suggest the image, but it is a somewhat more polished word. 

####sally 
**SALLY, ISSUE.**  
_Sally_, from Latin _satire_, to leap, is a particular kind of _issuing._ (For _issue_ see [arise](entry://arise).) It referred to the going forth of a detachment of soldiers from a besieged place to attack the besiegers. _Issue_ means, in general, to go forth. _Sally_ means to go forth with a certain spirit and gallantry, with an attitude of adventurousness. _Sally_ is applied figuratively to a humorous thrust, a witticism or jest; in this sense it is used mainly as a noun. Here, too, it keeps its fundamental implication of a spirited and unexpected attack.

####salute 
**SALUTE, SALUTATION, GREETING.**  
_Salute_ (see [accost](entry://accost)) concerns the thing; and _salutation_, which is a variation of _salute_, the person giving the _salute:_ a _salute_ may consist either of a word or an action; _salutations_ pass from one friend to another: the _salute_ may be either direct or indirect; the _salutation_ is always direct and personal; guns are fired by way of a _salute:_ bows are given as a _salutation._  
The _salutation_ is a familiar and ordinary form of courtesy between individuals; _greeting_ is frequently a particular mode of _salutation_ adopted on extraordinary occasions, indicative of great joy or satisfaction in those who _greet._

####salvation 
**SALVATION, DELIVERANCE, PRESERVATION, SAVING, REDEMPTION, RESCUE.**  
_Salvation_, in French _salvation_, from Latin _salvationem_, from _salvus_, whole, has both a physical and a moral application. In the physical application we seek or receive _deliverance_ from impending or present peril from some power beyond our own. We gain _preservation_ from something destructive by some act of our own or of others, and we may be the subject or object of a _rescue_ from danger, restraint, or violence.  
In the moral application we are taught that _salvation_ is the spiritual _deliverance_ from sin and death, through the _saving_ mercy of Jesus Christ, who offered himself as a ransom for mankind, his death being the final act of man's _redemption_, or the releasing and setting free of all living in sin.

####sanctify 
**SANCTIFY, CLEANSE, CONSECRATE, DEVOTE, HALLOW, PURIFY.**  
_Sanctify_, in French _sanctifier_, from Latin _sanctificere_, compound of _sanctus_, holy, and a weakened form of _facere_, to make, signifies literally to make holy or sacred, and applies both to persons and objects of a religious character.  
In the personal application, to _sanctify_ is to make holy, to have one's heart and life made to conform to the will of God. Prior to this act comes that to _cleanse_ or _purify_ from sin, to convert from a former state, to regenerate or make anew.  
To _consecrate_ is to set a person or object apart from that which is ordinary for some sacred purpose. This is done by others, as the _consecration_ of a religious edifice or some part thereof, and the _consecration_ of a person to the calling of the ministry.  
To _devote_ one's self to a sacred purpose is the act of the individual, to _devote_ an object is for one or others to give or apply it. To _hallow_ a place or object is to _consecrate_ or set it apart for a sacred purpose.

####sanguinary 
**SANGUINARY, BLOODY, BLOODTHIRSTY.**  
_Sanguinary_, from _sanguis_, is employed both in the sense of _bloody_, or having _blood_, and _bloodthirsty_, or _thirsting_ after _blood; sanguinary_, in the first case, relates only to _blood_ shed, as a _sanguinary_ engagement or a _sanguinary_ conflict; _bloody_ is used in the familiar application, to denote the simple presence of _blood_, as a _bloody_ coat or a _bloody_ sword.  
In the second case, _sanguinary_ is employed to characterize the tempers of persons only; _bloodthirsty_ to characterize the tempers of persons to any other beings', revolutionists will be frequently _sanguinary_, because they are abandoned to their passions and follow a lawless course of violence: tigers are by nature the most _bloodthirsty_ of all creatines. 

####sanguine 
**SANGUINE, ARDENT, BUOYANT, CHEERFUL, CONFIDENT, ELATED, ENTHUSIASTIC, HOPEFUL, WARM.**  
_Sanguine_, from the Latin _sanguis_, meaning blood. One who abounds in blood is said to have a _sanguine_ temperament, and that gives birth to the conditions indicated by the other terms.  
The _ardent_ person is warm, glowing, passionate, eager, and zealous; the _buoyant_ one is in a state of mental uplift and is seldom depressed; the _cheerful_ one is abounding in good spirits, is happy himself, and strives to make others happy; the _confident_ one feels assured of his own power and future; the _elated_ one is exultant, apt to be excitable, and is easily raised in spirits.  
_Enthusiastic_ persons are generally _ardent_, frequently visionary, sometimes fanatical, and always zealous in their undertakings. _Hopeful_ ones always look on the bright side of things, see the silver lining of clouds, and are full of anticipation, expectation, and trust; _warm_ ones are full of zeal, ardor, affection, and welcome, and are apt to be easily irritated.  
See also [optimistic](entry://optimistic)

####sanitary 
**SANITARY, SANATORY.**  
_Sanitary_, in French _sanitaire_, a coined word from Latin _sanitas_, sanity, and _sanatory_, extended from _sanator_, a healer (hence _sanatorium)_, are terms commonly used indiscriminately, but having different applications. _Sanitary_ specifically signifies something pertaining to health, _sanatory_ something conducive to health.  
Whatever is conducive to health, such as curing or healing applications or treatment, is _sanatory;_ whatever pertains to or is connected with the preservation of health is _sanitary._ Allied to these terms are _sanitation_, or the system of promoting healthful reforms, and _sanitarium_ or _sanatorium_, a resort for hygienic, restful, or curative treatment. 

####sap 
**SAP, UNDERMINE.**  
_Sap_, Anglo-Saxon _sœp_, signifies the juice which springs from the root of a tree; but _sap_, in the sense of _undermine_, is probably derived from Latin _sappa_, a spade or mattock; hence signifies to come at the root of anything by digging: to _undermine_ signifies to form a mine under the ground or under whatever is upon the ground: we may _sap_, therefore, without _undermining;_ and _undermine_ without _sapping:_ we may _sap_ the foundation of a house without making any mine underneath; and in fortifications we may _undermine_ either a mound, a ditch, or a wall without striking immediately at the foundation: hence, in the moral application, to _sap_ is a more direct and decisive mode of destruction; to _undermine_ is a gradual, and may be a partial, action. Infidelity saps the morals of a nation; courtiers _undermine_ one another's interests at court.

####satisfy 
**SATISFY, PLEASE, GRATIFY.**  
To _satisfy_ (see [contentment](entry://contentment)) is rather to produce pleasure indirectly; to _please_ (see [agreeable](entry://agreeable)) is to produce it directly: the former is negative, the latter positive, pleasure: as every desire is accompanied by more or less pain, _satisfaction_, which is the removal of desire, is itself to a certain extent pleasure; but what _satisfies_ is not always calculated to _please;_ nor is that which _pleases_ that which will always _satisfy:_ plain food _satisfies_ a hungry person, but does not _please_ him when he is not hungry; social enjoyments _please_, but they are very far from _satisfying_ those who do not restrict their indulgences. To _gratify_ is to _please_ in a high degree, to produce keen pleasure: we may be _pleased_ with trifles, but we are commonly _gratified_ with such things as act strongly either on the senses or the affections: an epicure is _gratified_ with those delicacies which suit his taste; an amateur in music will be _gratified_ by hearing a piece of Handel's composition finely performed.  
See also [compensation](entry://compensation)  
**SATISFY, SATIATE, GLUT, CLOY.** — To _satisfy_ is to make enough: _satiate_ is a frequentative, formed similarly from _satis_, enough, but signifying to have more than enough. _Glut_, in Latin _glutire_, allied to _gula_, the throat, signifies to take down the throat. _Satisfaction_ brings pleasure; it is what nature demands; and nature, therefore, makes a suitable return: _satiety_, meaning that which exceeds the desire, is attended with disgust; _glutting_ is an act of intemperance; it is what the inordinate appetite demands; it greatly exceeds the former in degree both of the cause and the consequence: _cloying_ is the consequence of _glutting._ Every healthy person _satisfies_ himself with a regular portion of food; children, if unrestrained, seek to _satiate_ their appetites, and _cloy_ themselves by their excesses; brutes, or men sunk to the level of brutes, _glut_ themselves with that which is agreeable to their appetites. So, in the moral application, we _satisfy_ desires in general or any particular desire; We _satiate_ the appetite for pleasure; one _gluts_ the eyes or the ears by anything that is horrible or painful or _cloys_ the mind. 

####saturnalia 
**SATURNALIA, CARNIVAL, ORGIES.**  
These words all indicate particular festivals, and hence, by extension, unrestrained license and riotous self-indulgence. _Saturnalia_, in Latin the neuter plural of _saturnalis_, pertaining to Saturn, was an ancient Roman festival in honor of the god Saturn, in which all classes, including slaves, took part. It was celebrated in December and was regarded as a period of unrestrained license.  
_Carnival_ (not as commonly misunderstood, from Italian _carne, vale!_ or "Farewell, oh flesh! nor, as Lord Byron tried to explain it, 'Farewell to flesh' ") is derived from Latin _carnis_, flesh, and Latin _lavare_, to lift, remove, take away, and is the festival immediately preceding Lent in Italy, celebrating the beginning of fleshless and fasting days by a riot of self-indulgence. _Orgy_, Latin _orgia_, from Greek _όργια_, secret rites, refers to the secret festivals in honor of Bacchus, the god of wine, celebrated by extravagant revels; the word is usually employed in the plural — _orgies._ In the figurative application of these words there is little difference. All indicate unrestrained riot; but there is more of harmless gayety in _carnival_, perhaps, and more of extravagance, violence, and shamelessness in _orgies._

####save 
**SAVE, SPARE, PRESERVE, PROTECT.**  
To _save_ is to keep or make safe. _Spare_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _spœr. Preserve_, compounded of _prœ_, before, and _servare_, keep (cf. German _hüten..._ VOR.), signifies to keep away from. _Protect_ (see [defend](entry://defend)).  
The idea of keeping free from evil is the common idea of all these terms, and the peculiar signification of the term _save;_ they differ either in the nature of the evil kept off or the circumstances of the agent: we may be _saved_ from every kind of evil; but we axe _spared_ only from those which it is in the power of another to inflict: we may be _saved_ from falling or _saved_ from an illness; a criminal is _spared_ from punishment, or we may be _spared_ by Divine Providence in the midst of some calamity.  
We may be _saved_ and _spared_ from any evils, great or small; we are _preserved_ and _protected_ only from evils of magnitude: we may be _saved_ either from the inclemency of the weather or the fatal vicissitudes of life: we may be _spared_ the pain of a disagreeable meeting or we may be _spared_ our lives; we are _preserved_ from ruin or _protected_ from oppression. To _save_ and _spare_ apply to evils that are actual and temporary; _preserve_ and _protect_ to those which are possible or permanent: we may be _saved_ from drowning; a person may be _preserved_ from infection or _protected_ from an attack. To _save_ may be the effect of accident or design; to _spare_ is always the effect of intentional forbearance; to _preserve_ and _protect_ are the effect of a special exertion of power, the latter in a still higher degree than the former: we may be _preserved_, by ordinary means, from the evils of human life; but we are _protected_ by the government or by Divine Providence from the active attacks of those who aim to do us harm.  
To _spare_ and _protect_ refer mostly to personal injuries; _save_ and _preserve_ are said of whatever one keeps from injury on account of its value; as to _save_ one's good name, to _preserve_ one's honor.

####scarcity 
**SCARCITY, DEARTH.**  
_Scarcity_ (see [rare](entry://rare)) is a generic term to denote the circumstance of a thing being _scarce. Dearth_, which is the same as dearness (Middle English _derthe_, formed from the adjective as _warmth, health, wealth_ are formed), is a mode of _scarcity_ applied in the literal sense to provisions mostly, as provisions are mostly dear when they are _scarce;_ the word _dearth_, therefore, denotes _scarcity_ in a high degree: whenever men want something and find it difficult to procure, they complain of its _scarcity:_ when a country has the misfortune to be visited with a famine, it experiences the frightfulest of all _dearths. Dearth_ is figuratively applied to moral objects; as a _dearth_ of intelligence, of talent, and the like. 

####scathe 
**SCATHE, DAMAGE, HARM, INJURY, MISCHIEF.**  
_Scathe_ is from a Teutonic root meaning to harm. These terms apply both to the body and material objects and to the individual mind. 

####scatter 
See [spread](entry://spread)

####scepticism 
**SCEPTICISM, AGNOSTICISM, ATHEISM.**  
These words are all used to indicate a disbelief in the articles of a religion, especially of the Christian religion, but they differ considerably in the degree and kind of unbelief that they indicate. _Scepticism_, from Greek _σκέπτομαι_, I consider, means the disposition to doubt all things, to come to no intellectual conclusion, because of an insufficiency of evidence. It has a wider application than the other two words and refers to a general intellectual attitude in respect to all things and not merely to an attitude to religious questions. _Agnosticism_ has a similar meaning. It was a word coined by Huxley in a heated controversy between the theologians of the old school and the evolutionary scientists of the new to express his own attitude — that of simple open-mindedness on the subject of all questions concerning which he had no scientific evidence, especially concerning articles of religious faith. The doctrines of the Church could not be proved, he said. They cannot therefore be declared a true _gnosis_ — a matter of intellectual knowledge. _Agnostic_ he coined by prefixing the privative _a_ to the Greek _gnosis_ to signify one who refused to consider statements not based, like the facts of natural science, on the evidence of the senses as matters of scientific fact. He wished to proclaim himself open to correction, however, ready to examine all evidence. _Agnosticism_ has therefore the same fundamental meaning as _scepticism._ The _agnostic_, like the _sceptic_, says, "I will consider, " but, practically and historically, the words have had a different meaning. The _sceptic_ doubts all evidence; the _agnostic_ admits the validity of a certain kind of evidence — the evidence of the senses. _Scepticism_, as applied to religion, has generally indicated positive disbelief; _agnosticism_, the position of the open-minded inquirer. _Atheism_, while often confused with the other terms, has an entirely different meaning. It signifies a disbelief in the existence of a God, or at least of a personal God. The consistent _agnostic_ cannot be an _atheist_, because, if he cannot prove the existence of a God, he is equally unable to prove His non-existence. 

####scheming 
**SCHEMING, ARTFUL, CONTRIVING, DESIGNING, INTRIGUING, PLANNING.**  
_Scheming_, in Latin _schema_, Greek _σχήμα_, form, from _σχήσω_, future of, from the verb _έχειν_, to hold, signifies holding in one's hands or one's mind the plan and means of future action. As acts of _contriving, designing_, and _planning_, the term may be used both in a proper or praiseworthy sense and in an improper and reprehensible one.  
These terms in the proper sense imply acts intended to result in benefits to ourselves or others on material fines, in which we devise, invent, project, outline, or sketch that which is necessary to the accomplishment of the purpose in mind. In the improper sense these operations may be to the disadvantage or injury of others.  
In being _artful_ and in _intriguing_ we become cunning, crafty, engaged in secret and underhand plots. We may be _artful_ solely, or all by ourselves, but when we are _intriguing_ we usually need confederates, as the plot or _scheme_ in mind is generally of a more or less complicated nature, and, as more than one person is involved, the intriguer cannot hold all the strings in his hands.

####scholar 
**SCHOLAR, DISCIPLE.**  
_Scholar_ (see [school](entry://school), below) and _disciple_ are both applied to such as learn from others: but the former is said only of those who learn the rudiments of knowledge; the latter of one who acquires any art or science from the instruction of another: the _scholar_ is opposed to the teacher; the _disciple_ to the master: children are always _scholars;_ adult persons may be _disciples. Scholars_ chiefly employ themselves in the study of words; _disciples_, as the _disciples_ of our Saviour, in the study of things: we are the _scholars_ of any one under whose care we are placed or from whom we learn anything, good or bad; we are the _disciples_ only of those who are distinguished, and for the most part in the good sense, though not always so: children are sometimes too apt _scholars_ in learning evil from one another. Philosophers of old had their _disciples_, and nowadays there are many who have been exalted into that character who have their _disciples_ and followers. 

####scholastic 
See [academic](entry://academic)

####school 
**SCHOOL, ACADEMY.**  
The Latin term _schola_ signified a loitering-place, a place for desultory conversation or instruction, from the Greek _σχολή_, leisure; hence it has been extended to any place where instruction is given, particularly that which is communicated to youth. _Academy_ derives its name from the Greek _άκαδήμεια_, the name of a gymnasium near Athens (so named for the hero Academus), where the philosopher Plato first gave his lectures, and which afterward became a place of resort for learned men; hence societies of learned men have since been termed _academies._ The leading idea in the word _school_ is that of instruction given and doctrine received; in the word _academy_ is that of association among those who have already learned: hence we speak in the literal sense of the _school_ where young persons meet to be taught, or in the extended and moral sense of the old and new _school_, the Pythagorean _school_, the philosophical _school_, and the like; but the _academy_ of arts or sciences, the French _Academy_, being members of any _academy_, and the like. 

####science

####scoff 
**SCOFF, GIBE, JEER, SNEER.**  
_Scoff_ is from an Old Low German word which may have meant originally a playful _shove. Gibe_ (also spelled _jibe)_ is from the Scandinavian. _Jeer_ is a word of doubtful origin. _Sneer_, Middle English _sneren_, is allied to _snarl. Scoffing_ is a general term for expressing contempt; we may _scoff_ either by _gibes, jeers_, or _sneers;_ or we may _scoff_ by opprobrious language and contemptuous looks, with _gibing, jeering_, or _sneering:_ to _gibe, jeer_, and _sneer_ are personal acts; the _gibe_ and jeer consist of words addressed to an individual: the former has most of ill-nature and reproach in it; the latter has more of ridicule or satire in it; they are both, however, applied to the actions of vulgar or unseemly people who practice their coarse jokes on others.  
_Scoff_ and _sneer_ are directed either to persons or things as the object; _gibe_ and _jeer_ only toward persons; _scoff_ is taken only in the proper sense; _sneer_ derives its meaning from the literal act of _sneering:_ the _scoffer_ speaks lightly of that which deserves serious attention: the _sneerer_ speaks either actually with a _sneer_ or as it were by implication with a _sneer:_ the _scoffers_ at religion set at naught all thoughts of decorum, they openly avow the little estimation in which they hold it; the _sneerers_ at religion are more sly, but not less malignant; they wish to treat religion with contempt, but not to bring themselves into the contempt they deserve.

####scruple 
**SCRUPLE, HESITATE, WAVER.**  
To _scruple_ (see [conscientious](entry://conscientious)) simply keeps us from deciding; the terms _hesitate_ (see [demur](entry://demur)) and _waver_, from Anglo-Saxon _wœfre_, restless, wandering, bespeak a fluctuating or variable state of the mind. We _scruple_ simply from motives of doubt as to the propriety of a thing; we _hesitate_ and _waver_ from various motives, particularly such as affect our interests. Conscience produces _scruples_, fear produces _hesitation_, irresolution produces _wavering:_ a person _scruples_ to do an action which may hurt his neighbor or offend his Maker; he _hesitates_ to do a thing which he fears may not prove advantageous to him; he _wavers_ in his mind between going or staying, according as his inclinations impel him to the one or the other: a man who does not _scruple_ to say or do as he pleases will be an offensive companion, if not a dangerous member of society: he who _hesitates_ only when the doing of good is proposed shows himself a worthless member of society; he who _wavers_ between his duty and his inclination will seldom maintain a long or doubtful contest.

####seal 
**SEAL, STAMP.**  
_Seal_ is a specific, _stamp_ a general, term: there cannot be a _seal_ without a _stamp;_ but there may be many _stamps_ where there is no _seal._ The _seal_, in Latin _sigillum_, the diminutive of _signum_, signifies a signet or little sign, consisting of any one's coat of arms or any device; the _stamp_ is, in general, any impression whatever which has been made by _stamping_ (from _stamp_, meaning to _step_ heavily, Greek _στέμβειν_, to _stamp)_, that is, any impression which is not easily to be effaced. In the improper sense, the _seal_ is the authority; thus, to set one's _seal_ is the same as to authorize, and the _seal_ of truth is any outward mark which characterizes it: but the _stamp_ is the impression by which we distinguish the thing; thus a thing is said to bear the _stamp_ of truth, of sincerity, of veracity, and the like. 

####seaman 
**SEAMAN, WATERMAN, SAILOR, MARINER.**  
All these words denote persons occupied in navigation; the _seaman_, as the word implies, follows his business on the sea; the _waterman_ is one who gets his livelihood on fresh water: the _sailor_ and the _mariner_ are both specific terms to designate the _seaman:_ every _sailor_ and _mariner_ is a _seaman;_ although every _seaman_ is not a _sailor_ or _mariner;_ the former is one who is employed about the laborious part of the vessel; the latter is one who traverses the ocean to and fro, who is attached to the water and passes his life upon it. Men of all ranks are denominated _seamen_, whether officers or men, whether in a merchantman or a king's ship: _sailor_ is used only for the common men, or, in the sea phrase, for those before the mast, particularly in vessels of war; hence our _sailors_ and soldiers are spoken of as the defenders of our country; a _mariner_ is an independent kind of _seaman_ who manages his own vessel and goes on an expedition on his own account; fishermen and those who trade along the coast are in a particular manner distinguished by the name of _mariners._

####second 
**SECOND, SUPPORT.**  
To _second_ is to give the assistance of a _second_ person; to _support_ is to bear up on one's own shoulders. To _second_ does not express so much as to _support:_ we _second_ only by our presence or our word; but we _support_ by our influence and all the means that are in our power: we _second_ a motion by a simple declaration of our assent to it; we _support_ a motion by the force of persuasions: so likewise we are said always to _second_ a person's views when we give him openly our countenance by declaring our approbation of his measures; and we are said to _support_ him when we give the assistance of our purse, our influence, or any other thing essential for the attainment of an end.  
**SECOND, SECONDARY, INFERIOR.** — _Second_ and _secondary_ both come from the Latin _secundus_, changed from _sequundus_ and _sequi_, to follow, signifying the order of succession: the former simply expresses this order; but the latter includes the accessory idea of comparative demerit: a person stands _second_ in a list, or a letter is _second_ which immediately succeeds the first; but a consideration is _secondary_, or of _secondary_ importance, which is opposed to that which holds the first rank. _Secondary_ and _inferior_ both designate some lower degree of a quality: but _secondary_ is applied only to the importance or value of things; _inferior_ is applied generally to all qualities: a man of business reckons everything as _secondary_ which does not forward the object he has in view; men of _inferior_ abilities are disqualified by nature for high and important stations, although they may be more fitted for lower stations than those of greater abilities. 

####secrecy 
See **concealment** under [conceal](entry://conceal)

####secret 
**SECRET, HIDDEN, LATENT, OCCULT, MYSTERIOUS.**  
What is _secret_ (see [clandestine](entry://clandestine)) is so far removed as to be out of observation; what is _hidden_ (see [conceal](entry://conceal)) is so covered over as to be altogether concealed: as a corner may be _secret;_ a hole underground is _hidden._  
What is _secret_ is known to some one; what is _hidden_ may be known to no one: it rests in the breast of an individual to keep a thing _secret;_ it depends on the course of things if anything remains _hidden:_ every man has more or less of that which he wishes to keep _secret;_ the talent of many lies _hidden_ for want of opportunity to bring it into exercise, as many treasures lie _hidden_ in the earth for want of being discovered and brought to light. A _secret_ may concern only the individual or individuals who hold it, and those from whom it is kept; but that which is _hidden_ may concern all the world: sometimes the success of a transaction depends upon its being kept _secret;_ the stores of knowledge which yet remain _hidden_ may be much greater than those which have been laid open. The _latent_, from the stem of Latin _latens_, lying hid, is the _secret_ or concealed in cases where it ought to be open: a _latent_ motive is that which a person intentionally, though not justifiably, keeps to himself; the _latent_ cause for any proceeding is that which is not revealed.  
_Occult_, in Latin _occultus_, participle of _occulere_, compounded of _ob_, over, and the stem found in _celare_, to hide, signifying that which is covered over; and _mysterious_ (see [dark](entry://dark)) are species of the _hidden:_ the former connotes that which has a veil naturally thrown over it; the latter that mostly which is covered with a supernatural veil: an _occult_ science is one that is _hidden_ from the view of persons in general, which is attainable but by few; _occult_ causes or qualities are those which he too remote to be discovered by the inquirer: the operations of Providence are said to be _mysterious_, as they are altogether past our finding out; many points of doctrine in our religion are equally _mysterious_, as connected with and dependent upon the attributes of the Deity.

####secular 
**SECULAR, TEMPORAL, WORLDLY.**  
_Secular_, in Latin _sœcularis_, from _sœculum_, an age or division of time, signifies belonging to time or this life. _Temporal_, in Latin _temporalis_, from _tempus_, time, signifies lasting only for a time. _Worldly_ signifies after the manner of the _world_ (from Anglo-Saxon _weoruld_, which is compounded of _wer_, a man, and _eld_, an age, signifying the age of a man, a man's life, the scene of a man's life).  
_Secular_ is opposed to ecclesiastical; _temporal_ and _worldly_ are opposed to spiritual or eternal. The idea of the _world_ or the outward objects and pursuits of the _world_, in distinction from that which is set above the _world_, is implied in common by all the terms; but _secular_ is an indifferent term, applicable to the legitimate pursuits and concerns of men; _temporal_ is used either in an indifferent or a bad sense; and _worldly_ mostly in a bad sense, as contrasted with things of more value. The office of a clergyman is ecclesiastical, but that of a school-master is _secular_, which is frequently vested in the same hands; the Upper House of Parliament consists of lords spiritual and _temporal; worldly_ interest has a more powerful sway over the minds of the great bulk of mankind than their spiritual interests.

####sedulous 
**SEDULOUS, DILIGENT, ASSIDUOUS.**  
The idea of application is expressed by these epithets; but _sedulous_, from the Latin _sedulus_, probably from _sedere_, to sit (the etymology se, apart, and _dolus_, guile, free from guile, working honestly, is an error), is a particular, _diligent_ (see [active](entry://active)) is a general, term: one is _sedulous_ by habit; one is _diligent_ either habitually or occasionally: a _sedulous_ scholar pursues his studies with regular and close application; a scholar may be _diligent_ at a certain period, though not invariably so. One is _sedulous_ from a conviction of the importance of the thing; one may be _diligent_ by fits and starts, according to the humor of the moment.  
Assiduous (Latin _ad_, near, and _sedere_, to sit) and _sedulous_ both express the quality of sitting or sticking close to a thing, but the former may, like _diligent_, be employed on a partial occasion; the latter is always permanent: we may be _assiduous_ in our attentions to a person; but we are _sedulous_ in the important concerns of life. _Sedulous_ peculiarly concerns the quiet employments of life, but may be applied to any pursuit requiring persevering attention; a teacher may be entitled _sedulous: diligent_ implies the active employments; one is _diligent_ at work: _assiduity_ holds a middle rank; it may be employed equally for that which requires active exertion or otherwise: we may be _assiduous_ in the pursuits of literature, or we may be _assiduous_ in our attendance upon a person or the performance of any office. 

####see 
**SEE, PERCEIVE, OBSERVE.**  
_See_, Anglo-Saxon _seón_, may be either a voluntary or involuntary action: _perceive_, through French from the Latin _percipere_, based on _per_, thoroughly, and a weakened form of _capere_, to take into the mind, is always a voluntary action; and _observe_ (see [notice](entry://notice)) is an intentional action. The eye sees when the mind is absent; the mind and the eye or other senses _perceive_ in conjunction: hence, we may say that a person sees, but does not _perceive:_ we _observe_ not merely by a simple act of the mind, but by its positive and fixed exertion. We see a thing without knowing what it is; we _perceive_ a thing, and know what it is, but the impression passes away; we _observe_ a thing, and afterward retrace the image of it in our mind. We see a star when the eye is directed toward it; we _perceive_ it move if we look at it attentively: we _observe_ its position in different parts of the heavens. The blind cannot _see_, the absent cannot _perceive_, the dull cannot _observe. Seeing_, as a corporeal action, is the act only of the eye; _perceiving_ and _observing_ are actions in which all the senses are concerned. We see colors, we _perceive_ the state of the atmosphere and _observe_ its changes.  
_Seeing_ sometimes extends further in its application to the mind's operations, in which it has an indefinite sense; but _perceive_ and _observe_ have both a definite sense; we may _see_ a thing distinctly and clearly or otherwise; we _perceive_ it always with a certain degree of distinctness, and _observe it_ with a positive degree of minuteness: we _see_ the truth of a remark; we _perceive_ the force of an objection; we _observe_ the reluctance of a person. It is further to be remarked, however, that, when _see_ expresses a mental operation, it expresses what is purely mental; _perceive_ and _observe_ are applied to such objects as are seen by the senses as well as the mind. We see the light with our eyes, or we _see_ the truth of a proposition with our mind's eyes; but we _perceive_ the difference of climate, or we _perceive_ the difference in the comfort of our situation; we _observe_ the motions of the heavenly bodies.

####seed 
See [germ](entry://germ)

####seek 
**SEEK, SEARCH.**  
To _seek_ and _search_ (see [examine](entry://examine)) are both employed in the sense of looking after something that is not in sight: _seek_ applies to that which is near at hand and easily found; _search_, to that which is remote, hidden, or not to be found without difficulty: to _search_, therefore, is properly to _seek_ laboriously; we _seek_ a person by simply going to the place where he is supposed to be; _search_ is made from place to place when it is not known where he is: a school-boy _seeks_ birds' nests; the botanist _searches_ for plants.  
These terms may also be applied to moral objects with the same distinction: as to _seek_ peace, knowledge; to _search_ the thoughts, to _search_ into mysteries. 

####seem 
**SEEM, APPEAR.**  
The idea of coming to the view is expressed by both these terms; but the word _seem_ rises upon that of _appear. Seem_, from Anglo-Saxon _séman_, to satisfy, conciliate, signifies literally to _appear_ like, and is therefore a species of _appearance; appear_, from the Latin _ad_, to, and _parere_, to come in sight, signifies to be present or before the eye. Every object may _appear;_ but nothing _seems_, except that which the mind admits to _appear_ in any given form. To _seem_ requires some reflection and comparison of objects in the mind one with another; it is, therefore, peculiarly applicable to matters that may be different from what they _appear_, or of an indeterminate kind: that the sun _seems_ to move is a conclusion which we draw from the exercise of our senses and comparing this case with others of a similar nature; it is only by a further research into the operation of nature that we discover this to be no conclusive proof of its motion. To _appear_, on the contrary, is the express act of things themselves on us; it is, therefore, peculiarly applicable to such objects as make an impression on us: to _appear_ is the same as to present itself: the stars _appear_ in the firmament, but we do not say that they _seem;_ the sun _appears_ dark through the clouds.  
They are equally applicable to moral as well as natural objects with the above-mentioned distinction. _Seem_ is said of that which is dubious, contingent, or future; _appear_, of that which is actual, positive, and past. A thing _seems_ strange which we are led to conclude as strange from what we see of it: a thing _appears_ clear when we have a clear conception of it: a plan _seems_ practicable or impracticable; an author _appears_ to understand his subject or the contrary. It _seems_ as if all efforts to reform the bulk of mankind will be found inefficient; it _appears_, from the long catalogue of vices which are still very prevalent, that little progress has hitherto been made in the work of reformation.

####segregate 
**SEGREGATE, SEPARATE.**  
_Segregate_ and _separate_ both mean to divide from something, to set apart. But _segregate_, from Latin _se_, meaning apart, away, and _gregare_, from _gregem_, accusative, meaning flock, herd, signifies to set apart in a group by itself. It means not merely to _separate_ (see [separate](entry://separate)) but, after _separation_, to keep in a _separate_ group. It is therefore a word of more specific meaning and narrower application.

####self-will 
**SELF-WILL, SELF-CONCEIT, SELF-SUFFICIENCY.**  
_Self-will_ signifies the _will_ in one's self: _self-conceit, conceit_ of one's self: _self-sufficiency, sufficiency_ in one's self. As characteristics _they_ come very near to each other, but that disposition of the will which refuses to submit to every control either within or without is born with a person, and is among the earliest indications of character; in some it is less predominant than in others, but, if not early checked, it is that defect in our natures which will always prevail; _self-conceit_ is a vicious habit of the mind which is superinduced on the original character; it is that which determines in matters of judgment: a _self-willed_ person thinks nothing of right or wrong; whatever the impulse of the moment suggests is the motive to action: the _self-conceited_ person is always much concerned about right and wrong, but it is only that which he conceives to be right and wrong; _self-sufficiency_ is a species of _self-conceit_ applied to action: as a _self-conceited_ person thinks of no opinion but his own; a _self-sufficient_ person refuses the assistance of every one in whatever he is called upon to do. 

####semblance 
See [show](entry://show)

####senior 
**SENIOR, ELDER, OLDER.**  
These are all comparatives expressive of the same quality, and differ, therefore, less in sense than in application. _Senior_ is employed not only in regard to the extent of age, but also to duration either in office or any given situation: _elder_ is employed only in regard to age: an officer in the army is a _senior_ by virtue of having served longer than another; a boy is a _senior_ in a school either by virtue of his age, his standing in the school, or his situation in the class; when, therefore, age alone is to be expressed, _elder_ is more suitable than _senior;_ the _elder_ children or the _elder_ branches of a family are clearly understood to include those who have priority of age.  
_Senior_ and _elder_ are both employed as substantives, _older_ only as an adjective: hence we speak of the _seniors_ in a school, or the _elders_ in an assembly; but an _older_ inhabitant, an _older_ family. _Elder_ has only a partial use; _older_ is employed in general cases: in speaking of children in the same family we may say the _elder_ son is hen to the estate; he is _older_ than his brother by ten years.

####sense 
**SENSE, JUDGMENT.**  
_Sense_ (see **feeling** under [feel](entry://feel)) signifies in general the faculty of feeling corporeally or perceiving mentally; in the latter case it is synonymous with _judgment_, which is a special operation of the mind. The _sense_ is that primitive portion of the understanding which renders an account of things; and the _judgment_ that portion of the reason which selects or rejects from this account. The _sense_ is, so to speak, the reporter which collects the details and exposes the facts; the _judgment_ is the _judge_ that passes sentence upon them. According to the strict import of the terms, the _judgment_ depends upon the _sense_, and varies with it in degree. He who has no _sense_ has no _judgment;_ and he who loses _sense_ loses _judgment:_ since _sense_ supplies the knowledge of things, and _judgment_ pronounces upon them, it is evident that there must be _sense_ before there can be _judgment._  
On the other hand, sense may be so distinguished from _judgment_ that there may be _seme_ without _judgment_, and _judgment_ without _sense: sense_ is the faculty of perceiving in general; it is applied to abstract science as well as general knowledge: _judgment_ is the faculty of determining, that is, of determining mostly in matters of practice. By _sense_ the mind perceives by an immediate act, by the _judgment_ it arrives at conclusions by a process. It is the lot of many, therefore, to have _sense_ in matters of theory who have no _judgment_ in matters of practice; while others, on the contrary, who have nothing above common _sense_ will have a soundness of _judgment_ that is not to be surpassed. Nay, further, it is possible for a man to have good _sense_ and yet not solid _judgment:_ as they are both natural faculties, men are gifted with them as variously as with every other faculty. By good _sense_ a man is enabled to discern, as it were, intuitively, that which requires another of less sense to ponder over and study; by solid _judgment_ a man is enabled to avoid those errors in conduct which one of weak _judgment_ is always falling into. There is, however, this distinction between _sense_ and _judgment_, that the deficiencies of the former may be supplied by diligence and attention; but a defect in the latter is not so easily to be supplied by efforts of one's own. A man may improve his _sense_ in proportion as he has the means of information; but the _judgment_ once matured rarely makes any advances toward improvement afterward.  
The words _sense_ and _judgment_ are frequently employed without any epithets to denote a positively large share of these faculties.  
As epithets, _sensible_ and _judicious_ both denote the possession of these faculties in a high degree, but in their application they are distinguished as above. A writer or a speaker is said to be _sensible;_ a friend, or an adviser, to be _judicious. Sense_ displays itself in the conversation or the communication of one's ideas; _judgment_ in the propriety of one's actions. A _sensible_ man may be an entertaining companion, but a _judicious_ man in any post of command is an inestimable treasure. _Sensible_ remarks are always calculated to please and interest _sensible_ people; _judicious_ measures have a sterling value in themselves that is appreciated according to the importance of the object. Hence it is obvious that to be _sensible_ is a desirable thing, but to be _judicious_ is an indispensable requisite in those who have to act a part.  
See also **signification** under [sign](entry://sign)  
**SENSIBLE, SENSITIVE, SENTIENT.** — All these epithets, which are derived from the same source, have obviously a great sameness of meaning, though not of application. _Sensible_ and _sensitive_ both denote the capacity of being moved to feeling: _sentient_ implies the very act of feeling. _Sensible_ expresses either a habit of the body and mind or only a particular state referring to some particular object: a person may be _sensible_ of things in general, _or sensible_ of cold, _sensible_ of injuries, _sensible_ of the kindnesses which he has received from an individual. _Sensitive_ signifies always an habitual or permanent quality; it is the characteristic of objects: a _sensitive_ creature implies one whose _sense_ is quickly to be acted upon; a _sensitive_ plant is a peculiar species of plants, marked for the property of having _sense_ or being _sensible_ of the touch.  
_Sensible_ and _sensitive_ have always a reference to external objects; but _sentient_ expresses simply the possession of feeling or the power of feeling, and excludes the idea of the cause. Hence, the terms _sensible_ and _sensitive_ are applied only to persons or corporeal objects: but _sentient_, which conveys the most abstract meaning, is applicable to men and spirits; _sentient_ beings, taken absolutely, may include angels as well as men; it is restricted in its meaning by the context only.  
**SENSIBLE, PERCEPTIBLE.** — These epithets are here applied not to the persons capable of being impressed, but to the objects capable of impressing: in this case _sensible_ (see [feel](entry://feel)) applies to that which acts on the senses merely; _perceptible_ (see [see](entry://see)), to that which acts on the _senses_ in conjunction with the mind. All corporeal objects are naturally termed _sensible_, inasmuch as they are _sensible_ to the eye, the ear, the nose, the touch, and the taste; particular things are _perceptible_, inasmuch as they are to be _perceived_ or recognized by the mind. Sometimes _sensible_ signifies discernible by means of the _senses_, as when we speak of a _sensible_ difference in the atmosphere, and in this case it comes nearer to the meaning of _perceptible;_ but the latter always refers more to the operation of the mind than the former: the difference between colors is said to be scarcely _perceptible_ when they approach very near to each other, so likewise the growth of a body is said not to be _perceptible_ when it cannot be marked from one time to another by the difference of state.

####sensualist 
**SENSUALIST, VOLUPTUARY, EPICURE.**  
The _sensualist_ lives for the indulgence of his senses: the _voluptuary_ (from _voluptas_, pleasure) is devoted to lus pleasures, and as far as these pleasures are the pleasures of sense the _voluptuary_ is a _sensualist:_ the _epicure_, from _Epicurus_, is one who makes the pleasures of sense his god, and in this sense he is a _sensualist_ and a _voluptuary._ In the application of these terms, however, the _sensualist_ is one who is a slave to the grossest appetites; the _voluptuary_ is one who studies his pleasures so as to make them the most valuable to himself; the _epicure_ is a species of _voluptuary_ who practices more than ordinary refinement in the choice of his pleasures. 

####sentence 
**SENTENCE, PROPOSITION, PERIOD, PHRASE.**  
_Sentence_, in Latin _sententia_, is but a variation of _sentiment_ (see  
OPINION). _Proposition_ (see [proposal](entry://proposal)). _Period_, in Latin _periodus_, Greek περίοδος, from περί, about, and _οδός_, way, signifies the circuit or round of words which renders the sense complete. _Phrase_, from the Greek _φράζειν_, to speak, signifies the words uttered.  
The _sentence_ consists of any words which convey sentiment: the _proposition_ consists of the thing set before the mind, that is, either our own minds or the minds of others; hence the term _sentence_ has more special regard to the form of words, and the _proposition_ to the matter contained: they are both used technically or otherwise, the former in grammar and rhetoric, the latter in logic. The _sentence_ is simple and complex; the _proposition_ is universal or particular. _Period_ and _phrase_, like _sentence_, are forms of words, but they are solely so, whereas the _sentence_ depends on the connection of ideas by which it is formed: we speak of _sentences_ either as to their structure or their sentiment; hence the _sentence_ is either grammatical or moral: but the _period_ regards only the structure; it is either well or ill turned: the term _phrase_ denotes the character of the words; hence it is either vulgar or polite, idiomatic or general: the _sentence_ must consist of at least two words to make sense; the _phrase_ may be a single word or otherwise.  
See also **decision** under [decide](entry://decide)  
**SENTENCE, DOOM, CONDEMN.** — To _sentence_, or pass _sentence_, is to give a final opinion or decision which is to influence the fate of an object. _Condemn_, from _con_ for _cum_, wholly, and _damnare_, to harm or punish, is to pass such a _sentence_ as shall be to the hurt of an object. _Doom_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _dom_, a thing set or decided on, from the verb _don_, to do, Modern English _do._  
When these terms are taken in the judicial sense, to _sentence_ is indefinite as to the quantum of punishment, which may be great or small; a criminal may be _sentenced_ to a mild or severe punishment: to _condemn_ and _doom_ are always employed to denote a severe punishment, and the latter still severer than the former. A person is _condemned_ to the galleys, to transportation for life, or to death; he is _doomed_ to eternal misery. To _sentence_ is always the act of some conscious agent; but to _condemn_ and _doom_ may be the effect of circumstances or brought about by the nature of things. A person is always _sentenced_ by some one to suffer in consequence of his conduct; he is _condemned_ or _doomed_, either by his misfortune or his fault, to suffer whatever circumstances impose upon him; immoral writers are justly _condemned_ to oblivion or infamy; or persons may be _condemned_ by their hard lot to struggle through life for a bare living; and some are _doomed_ by a still harder lot to penury and wretchedness.  
To _sentence_ is to pass sentence in the judicial sense only; but the noun _sentence_ is taken in the sense of a judgment, and has likewise a moral as well as a judicial application, in which latter case it admits of a further comparison with _condemn_ or _condemnation._ The _sentence_ is a formal and the _condemnation_ an informal judgment: the _sentence_ may be favorable or unfavorable: the _condemnation_ is always unfavorable: critics pronounce their _sentence_ on the merits or demerits of a work; the public may _condemn_ a measure in any manner by which they make their sentiments known. To _doom_, which signifies only to determine the fate of a person, is not allied to the other terms in their moral application.  
**SENTENTIOUS, SENTIMENTAL.** — _Sententious_ signifies having or abounding in _sentences_ or judgments; _sentimental_, having _sentiment_ (see **opinion** under [opinionated](entry://opinionated)). Books and authors are termed _sententious;_ but travellers, society, intercourse, correspondence, and the like are characterized as _sentimental._ Moralists, whose works and conversation abound in moral _sentences_, like Dr. Johnson's, are termed _sententious;_ novelists and romance-writers, like Mrs. Radcliffe, are properly _sentimental. Sententious_ books always serve for improvement; _sentimental_ works, unless they are of a superior order, are in general hurtful. 

####sentient 
See **sensible** under [sense](entry://sense)

####sentiment 
**SENTIMENT, SENSATION, PERCEPTION.**  
_Sentiment_ and _sensation_ are obviously derived from the same source (see [feel](entry://feel)). _Perception_, from _perceive_ (see [see](entry://see)), expresses the act of _perceiving_ or the impressions produced by _perceiving._  
The impressions which objects make upon the person are designated by all these terms; but the _sentiment_ has its seat in the heart, the _sensation_ is confined to the senses, and the _perception_ rests in the understanding. _Sentiments_ are lively, _sensations_ are grateful, _perceptions_ are clear. Gratitude is a _sentiment_ most pleasing to the human mind: the _sensation_ produced by the action of electricity on the frame is generally unpleasant; a nice _perception_ of objects is one of the first requisites for perfection in any art.  
The _sentiment_ extends to manners and renders us alive to the happiness or misery of others as well as our own; it is that by which men are most nearly allied to each other: the _sensation_ is purely physical, and the effect of external objects upon either the body or the mind: _perceptions_ carry us into the district of science; they give us an interest in all the surrounding objects as intellectual observers. A man of spirit or courage receives marks of honor, or affronts, with very different _sentiments_ from the poltroon; he who bounds his happiness by the present fleeting existence must be careful to remove every painful _sensation:_ we judge of objects as complex or simple according to the number of _perceptions_ which they produce in us.

####separate 
**SEPARATE, SEVER, DISJOIN, DETACH.**  
To _separate_ (see [abstract](entry://abstract)) is the general term: whatever is united or joined in any way may be _separated_, be the junction natural or artificial; but to _sever_, which is but a variation of _separate_, is a mode of _separating_ natural bodies or bodies naturally joined: we may _separate_ in part or entirely; we _sever_ entirely: we _separate_ with or without violence; we _sever_ with violence only: we may _separate_ papers which have been pasted together or fruits which have grown together; but the _head_ is _severed_ from the body or a branch from the trunk.  
To _separate_ may be said of things which are only remotely connected; _disjoin_, signifying to destroy a junction, is said of that which is intimately connected so as to be joined: we _separate_ as convenience requires; we may _separate_ in a right or a wrong manner; we mostly _disjoin_ things which ought to remain joined: we _separate_ syllables in order to distinguish them; but they are sometimes _disjoined_ in writing by an accidental erasure. To _detach_, from Latin _de_, from, and French _tacher_, perhaps from a German word akin to the English tack or nail, signifying to take from a nail, has an intermediate sense between _separate_ and _disjoin_, applying to bodies which are neither so loosely connected as the former nor so closely as the latter: we _separate_ things that directly meet in no point; we _disjoin_ those which may meet in many points; we _detach_ those things which meet in one point only.  
_Separate, sever_, and _detach_ may be applied to mental as well as corporeal objects; persons may be _separated_ from each other by diversity of interests or opinions; they may be _severed_ from each other when their affections are estranged toward each other; they may be _detached_ from each other by circumstances after having been attached by any tie.

####sequel 
**SEQUEL, CLOSE.**  
_Sequel_ is a species of _close;_ it is that which follows by way of termination; but the _close_ is simply that which _closes_, or puts an end to anything. There cannot be a _sequel_ without a _close_, but there may be a _close_ without a _sequel._ A story may have either a _sequel_ or a _close;_ when the end is detached from the beginning so as to follow, it is a _sequel;_ if the beginning and end are uninterrupted, it is simply a _close._ When a work is published in distinct parts, those which follow at the end may be termed the _sequel;_ if it appears all at once, the concluding pages are the _close._

####serene 
See [calm](entry://calm)

####series 
**SERIES, COURSE.**  
A _series_, in Latin _series_, from _serere_, to bind or connect, is applied to things which are connected with each other simply in order of time or number. _Course_, in Latin _cursus_ from _currere_, to run, signifying the line formed or the direction taken in running, applies to things which are so connected as to form, as it were, a line; a _series_ of events are such as follow in order of time; a _series_ of numbers of any work are such as follow in numerical order; a _course_ of events is such as tends to the same end; a _course_ of lectures, such as is delivered on the same subject.

####servant 
**SERVANT, DOMESTIC, MENIAL, DRUDGE.**  
In the term _servant_ is included the idea of the service performed: in the term _domestic_, ultimately from _domus_, a house, is included the idea of one belonging to the house or family: in the word _menial_, from Old French _meisnee_ (from Low Latin _mansionata)_, a household (compare the title of Ruskin's book _Love's Meinie)_, there is a similar suggestion; _drudge_ comes from an Anglo-Saxon root signifying to endure, and is allied to _drudgery_, meaning hard and unpleasant work. We hire a _servant_ at a certain rate and for a particular service; we are attached to our _domestics_ according to their assiduity and attention to our wishes; we employ as a _menial_ one who is unfit for a higher employment; and a _drudge_ in any labor, however hard and disagreeable. 

####service 
See [benefit](entry://benefit); [utility](entry://utility)

####servitude 
**SERVITUDE, SLAVERY, BONDAGE.**  
_Servitude_ expresses less than _slavery_, and this less than _bondage. Servitude_, based on _servire_, conveys simply the idea of performing a service without specifying the principle upon which it is performed. Among the Romans, _servus_ signified a slave, because all who served were literally slaves, the power over the person being almost unlimited. The mild influence of Christianity has corrected men's notions with regard to their rights as well as their duties, and established _servitude_ on the just principle of a mutual compact, without any infraction of that most precious of all human gifts, personal liberty. _Slavery_, which marks a condition incompatible with the existence of this invaluable endowment, is a term odious to the modern ear: it had its origin in the grossest state of society, the word being derived from the Late Latin _sclavus_, from _Sclavi_ or _Slavi_ (cf. the Russian _slava_, glory), a fierce and intrepid people who made a long stand against the Germans, and, being at last defeated, were made _slaves. Slavery_, therefore, includes not only _servitude_, but also the odious circumstances of the entire subjection of one individual to another. _Bondage_ came through Anglo-French from the Scandinavian _bondi_, a tiller of the soil (compare _husband)_, but it has been associated in the popular mind with the verb _bind;_ it signifies _slavery_ in its most aggravated form, in which, to the loss of personal liberty, is added cruel treatment; the term is seldom applied in its proper sense to any persons but the Israelites in Egypt. In a figurative sense we speak of being a _slave_ to our passions, and under the _bondage_ of sin, in which cases the terms preserve precisely the same distinction.  
The same distinction exists between the epithets _servile_ and _slavish_, which are employed only in the moral application. He who is _servile_ has the mean character of a servant, but he is still a free agent; but ne who is _slavish_ is bound and fettered in every possible form.

####shade 
**SHADE, SHADOW.**  
_Shade_ and _shadow_ both come from Anglo-Saxon _scœd, sceadu_, a shadow. Both these terms express that darkness which is occasioned by the sun's rays being intercepted by anybody; but _shade_ simply expresses the absence of the light, and _shadow_ signifies also the figure of the body which thus intercepts the fight. Trees naturally produce a _shade_, by means of their branches and leaves: and wherever the image of the tree is reflected on the earth that forms its _shadow._ It is agreeable in the heat of summer to sit in the _shade;_ the constancy with which the _shadow_ follows the man has been proverbially adopted as a simile for one who clings close to another.  
In the moral application they are more widely distinguished in their signification. As a _shade_ implies darkness, so to be in the _shade_ is the same as to be in obscurity; as the _shadow_ is but a reflection or appearance, so, in the moral sense, the _shadow_ of a thing is that which is opposed to the substance. 

####shake 
**SHAKE, TREMBLE, SHUDDER, QUIVER, QUAKE.**  
_Shake_ is in Anglo-Saxon _sceacan;_ and _shudder_ is a frequentative verb based on Old Low German expressing a similar idea. _Quake_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _cwacian_, having the same meaning. _Quiver_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _cwifer_ in the adverb _cwifer-lice_, eagerly. _Tremble_ comes from Low Latin _tremulare_, from classical Latin _tremulus_, trembling.  
To _shake_ is a generic term, the rest are but modes of _shaking:_ to _tremble_ is to _shake_ from an inward cause or what appears to be so: in this manner a person _trembles_ from fear, from cold, or weakness; and a leaf which is imperceptibly agitated by the air is also said to _tremble:_ to _shudder_ is to _tremble_ violently: to _quiver_ and to _quake_ are both to _tremble_ quickly; but the former denotes rather a vibratory motion, as the point of a spear when thrown against wood: the latter a quick motion of the whole body, as in the case of bodies that have not sufficient consistency in themselves to remain still.  
**SHAKE, AGITATE, TOSS.** — _Shake_ (see above). _Agitate_, in Latin _agitare_, is a frequentative of _ago_, to drive, that is, to drive different ways. _Toss_ is probably contracted from _torsi_, perfect of _torqueo_, to whirl.  
A motion more or less violent is signified by all these terms, which differ both in the manner and the cause of the motion. _Shake_ is indefinite, it may differ in degree as to the violence; to _agitate_ and _toss_ rise in sense upon the word _shake:_ a breeze _shakes_ a leaf, a storm _agitates_ the sea, and the waves _toss_ a vessel to and fro: large and small bodies may be _shaken;_ large bodies are _agitated:_ a handkerchief may be _shaken;_ the earth is _agitated_ by an earthquake. What is _shaken_ and _agitated_ is not removed from its place; but what is _tossed_ is thrown from place to place. A house may frequently be _shaken_, while the foundation remains good; the waters are most _agitated_ while they remain within their bounds; but a ball is _tossed_ from hand to hand.  
To _shake_ and _toss_ are the acts either of persons or things; to _agitate_ is the act of tilings when taken in the active sense. A person _shakes_ the hand of another, or the motion of a carriage _shakes_ persons in general and _agitates_ those who are weak in frame: a child _tosses_ his food about; or the violent motion of a vessel _tosses_ everything about which is in it. To _shake_ arises from external or internal causes; we may be _shaken_ by others, or _shake_ ourselves from cold: to _agitate_ and toss arise from some external action, direct or indirect; the body may be _agitated_ by violent concussion from without, or from the action of perturbed feelings; the body may be _tossed_ by various circumstances, and the mind may be tossed to and fro by the violent action of the passions. Hence the propriety of using the terms in the moral application. The resolution is _shaken_, as the tree is by the wind; the _mind_ is _agitated_ like troubled waters; a person is tossed to and fro in the ocean of life, as the vessel is _tossed_ by the waves.

####sharp 
**SHARP, ACUTE, KEEN.**  
The general property expressed by these epithets is that of _sharpness_, or an ability to cut. The term _sharp_, in Anglo-Saxon _scearp_, to cut, is generic and indefinite; the two others are modes of _sharpness_ differing in the circumstance or the degree: the _acute_ is not only more than _sharp_ in the common sense, but signifies also _sharp-pointed:_ a knife may be _sharp_, but a needle is properly _acute._ Things are _sharp_ that have either a long or a pointed edge; but the _keen_ is applicable only to the long edge, and that in the highest degree of _sharpness:_ a common knife may be _sharp;_ but a razor or a lancet is properly said to be _keen._ These terms preserve the same distinction in their figurative use. Every pain is _sharp_ which may resemble that which is produced by cutting; it is _acute_ when it resembles that produced by piercing deep: words are said to be _sharp_ which have any power in them to wound; they are _keen_ when they cut deep and wide.

####sharp-shooter 
**SHARP-SHOOTER, MARKSMAN, SNIPER.**  
_Sharp-shooter_ is a compound of _sharp_, in Anglo-Saxon _scearp_, and English _shooter._ A _sharp-shooter_, as a _marksman_, is one skilled in shooting with a revolver or rifle at a target or other object. In warfare a _sharpshooter_ is an expert _marksman_ selected to pick off an enemy at long range or under unusual conditions, and his employment is considered legitimate.  
A _sniper_, on the contrary, is a sneaking soldier or other person, skilled in the use of a rifle, who fires from the roof or upper windows of a building on persons passing in the street below. On the occupation of Vera Cruz, Mexico, by United States forces in 1914, much annoyance was caused soldiers passing on the streets by shots from concealed _snipers._

####shibboleth 
**SHIBBOLETH, CRITERION, PASSWORD, TEST.**  
_Shibboleth_, in Hebrew _shibbóleth_, meaning an ear of corn, also a river, from _shábal_, to grow, to flow, signifies, specifically, the test-word or password used by the Gileadites, under Jephthah, after their victory over the Ephraimites, as recorded in Judges xii, 6. The latter were unable to pronounce the _sh_, and, in attempting to escape, gave the word as _sibbóleth_, by which they betrayed themselves, and were slaughtered mercilessly.  
Figuratively, the term is now used as a watchword, password, testword, or countersign of a political party, sect, or other organization, and, as such, it implies a _criterion_, a standard, law, principle, or fact by which the quality of anything may be estimated, or, as applied to persons, that by which they may be identified or have their accounts of themselves established. A _watchword, password_, or _testword_, in military, naval, political, and society usage, is a word or phrase given to persons entitled thereto by which they can prove themselves when questioned.  
For a critical comparison of _criterion_ and _standard_ see the article on the former term.

####shine 
**SHINE, GLITTER, GLARE, SPARKLE, RADIATE.**  
_Shine_ is in Anglo-Saxon _scinan. Glitter_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _glitinian_, to shine. _Glare_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _glœr_, a pellucid substance, amber, where the _r_ stands for an older _s;_ hence _glare_ is closely allied to _glass._ To _sparkle_ signifies to produce _sparks;_ and _spark_ is in Anglo-Saxon _spearca_, and refers to the crackling sound of the firebrand. To _radiate_ is to produce rays, from the Latin _radius_, a ray.  
The emission of light is the common idea conveyed by these terms. To _shine_ expresses simply this general idea: _glitter_ and the other verbs include some collateral idea in their signification. To _shine_ is a steady emission of light; to _glitter_ is an unsteady emission of light, occasioned by the reflection on transparent or bright bodies: the sun and moon _shine_ whenever they make their appearance; but a set of diamonds _glitters_ by the irregular reflection of the light on them; or the brazen spire of a steeple _glitters_ when the sun in the morning _shines_ upon it. This is the same in the improper as the proper application.  
_Shine_ specifies no degree of light; it may be barely sufficient to render itself visible, or it may be a very strong degree of light: _glare_, on the contrary, denotes the highest possible degree of light: the sun frequently _glares_ when it _shines_ only at intervals; and the eye also _glares._  
To _shine_ is to emit light in a full stream; but to _sparkle_ is to emit it in small portions, and to _radiate_ is to emit it in long Unes. The fire _sparkles_ in the burning of wood; or the light of the sun _sparkles_ when it strikes on knobs or small points; or the eye _sparkles:_ the sun _radiates_ when it seems to emit its light in rays.

####shock 
**SHOCK, CONCUSSION.**  
_Shock_ denotes a violent jolt or agitation; _concussion_, a shaking together. The _shock_ is often instantaneous, but does not necessarily extend beyond the act of the moment; the _concussion_ is permanent in its consequences, it tends to derange the system. Hence the different application of the terms: the _shock_ may affect either the body or the mind; the _concussion_ affects properly only the body or corporeal objects: a violent and sudden blow produces a _shock_ at the moment it is given, but it does not always produce a _concussion:_ the violence of a fall will, however, sometimes produce a _concussion_ in the brain, which in future affects the intellect.  
As _shock_ conveys no idea of separation, only of impression, it is equally applicable to the mind and the body. Sudden news of an exceedingly painful nature will often produce a _shock_ on the mind; but time mostly serves to wear away the effect which has been produced.

####shoot 
**SHOOT, DART.**  
To _shoot_ and _dart_, in the proper sense, are clearly distinguished from each other, as expressing different modes of sending bodies to a distance from a given point. From the circumstances of the actions arise their different application to other objects in the improper sense; as that which proceeds by _shooting_ goes forth from a body unexpectedly and with great rapidity: so, in the figurative sense, a plant _shoots_ up, or a star is said to _shoot_ in the sky which seems to move in a _shooting_ manner from one place to another. 

####short 
**SHORT, BRIEF, CONCISE, SUCCINCT, SUMMARY.**  
_Short_, Anglo-Saxon _sceort._ comes from a root meaning to cut; it is the generic, the rest are specific terms: everything which admits of dimensions may be _short_, as opposed to the long, that is, either naturally or artificially; the rest are species of artificial _shortness_, or that which is the work of art: hence it comes that material, as well as spiritual, objects may be termed _short:_ but _brief_, in Latin _brevis_, in Greek _βραχύς, concise_, from Latin _concisus_, signifying cut into a small body, _succinct_, in Latin _succinctus_, participle of _sub_, up, and _cingere_, to girdle, meaning to draw up the skirts under the girdle, and fasten that tightly, signifying therefore brought within a small compass, and _summary_ (see **abridgment** under [abridge](entry://abridge)) are intellectual or spiritual only. We may term a stick, a letter, or a discourse _short;_ but we speak of _brevity_ only in regard to the mode of speech; _conciseness_ and _succinctness_ as to the matter of speech; _summary_ as to the mode either of speaking or acting: the _brief_ is opposed to the lengthy or prolix; the _concise_ and _succinct_ to the diffuse; the _summary_ to the circumstantial or ceremonious. It is a matter of comparatively little importance whether a man's life be long or _short;_ but it deeply concerns him that every moment be well spent: _brevity_ of expression ought to be consulted by speakers, even more than by writers; _conciseness_ is of peculiar advantage in the formation of rules for young persons; and _succinctness_ is a requisite in every writer who has extensive materials to digest; a _summary_ mode of proceeding may have the advantage of saving time, but it has the disadvantage of incorrectness and often of injustice.

####show 
**SHOW, POINT OUT, MARK, INDICATE.**  
_Show_, Anglo-Saxon _scéawian_, to see, then to make to see, is here the general term, and the others specific: the common idea included in the signification of them all is that of making a thing visible to another. To _show_ is an indefinite term; one _shows_ by simply setting a thing before the eyes of another: to _point out_, to fix a _point_ upon a thing, is specific; it is to _show_ some particular _point_ by a direct and immediate application to it: we _show_ a person a book when we put it into his hands; but we _point out_ the beauties of its contents by making a _point_ upon them or accompanying the action with some particular movement which shall direct the attention of the observer in a specific manner. Many things, therefore, may be _shown_ which cannot be _pointed out:_ a person _shows_ himself, but he does not _point_ himself _out;_ towns, houses, gardens, and the like are _shown;_ but single things of any description are _pointed out._  
To _show_ and _point out_ are direct personal acts; to _mark, i.e._, to put a_ mark_ on, is an indirect means of making a thing visible or observable: a tradesman _marks_ the prices of the articles which he sets forth in his shop.  
_Show_ and _mark_ denote the acts of conscious or unconscious agents; _point out_, that of conscious agents only: _indicate_ (see [mark](entry://mark)) that of unconscious agents only; in this case, what _shows_ serves as an evidence or proof; what _marks_ serves to direct or guide; what _indicates_ serves as an index to _point out._ That _shows_ the fallacy of forming schemes for the future; it _marks_ the progress of time; it _indicates_ decay.  
In an extended moral application they preserve the same distinction; to _show_ is to prove in a general way that a thing is or will be; to _indicate_ is to _show_ or _point out_ in a particular manner that a thing is.  
**SHOW, EXHIBIT, DISPLAY.** — To _show_ is here, as before, the generic term; to _exhibit_ (see [give](entry://give)) and _display_, from Old French _despleier_, derived from Latin _dis_, apart, and _plicare_, to fold, signifying to unfold or set forth to view, are specific: they may all designate the acts either of persons or things: the first, however, does this either in the proper or the improper sense; the latter two rather in the improper sense. To _show_ is an indefinite action applied to every object: things are _shown_ for purposes of convenience; as one _shows_ a book to a friend: _exhibit_ is applied to matters that are extraordinary or unusual; things are _exhibited_ to attract notice, as to _exhibit_ flowers or animals: we _show_ to one or many; we _exhibit_ or _display_ in as public a manner, and to as great numbers, as possible; as to _show_ the marks to the by-standers; to _exhibit_ a figure upon a pole; to _display_ one's finery.  
They admit of the same distinction when applied to moral objects: we may _show_ courage, dislike, or any other emotion: _exhibit_ skill, prowess, etc., in the field of battle; _display_ heroism, and whatever may shine forth.  
When said of things, they differ principally in the manner or degree of clearness with which the thing appears to present itself to view: to _show_ is, as before, altogether indefinite, and implies simply to bring to view; _exhibit_ implies to bring inherent properties to light, that is, apparently by a process; to _display_ is to set forth so as to strike the eye: the windows on a frosty morning will _show_ the state of the weather; experiments with the air-pump _exhibit_ the many wonderful and interesting properties of air; the beauties of the creation are peculiarly _displayed_ in the spring season. See also [unveil](entry://unveil)  
**SHOW, EXHIBITION, REPRESENTATION, SIGHT, SPECTACLE.** — _Show_ signifies the thing shown; _exhibition_ signifies the thing exhibited; _representation_, the thing represented; _sight_, the thing to be seen; and _spectacle_, from the Latin _spectaculum_, based on _spectare_, stands for the thing to be beheld.  
_Show_ is here, as in the former article, the most general term. Everything set forth to view is _shown;_ and, if set forth for the amusement of others, it is a _show._ This is the common idea included in the terms _exhibition_ and _representation:_ but _show_ is a term of vulgar meaning and application; the others have a higher use and signification. The _show_ consists of that which merely pleases the eye; it is not a matter either of taste or art, but merely of curiosity: an _exhibition_, on the contrary, presents some effort of talent or some work of genius; and a _representation_ sets forth the image or imitation of something by the power of art: hence we speak of a _show_ of wild beasts, an _exhibition_ of paintings, and a theatrical _representation._ The conjurer makes a _show_ of his tricks at a fair, to the wonder of the gazing multitude; the artist makes an _exhibition_ of his works; _representations_ of men and manners are given on the stage.  
_Shows, exhibitions_, and _representations_ are presented by some one to the view of others; _sights_ and _spectacles_ present themselves to view. _Sight_, like _show_, is a vulgar term, and _spectacle_ the nobler term. Whatever is to be seen to excite notice is a _sight_, in which general sense it would comprehend every _show_, but in its particular sense it includes only that which casually offers itself to view; a _spectacle_, on the contrary, is that species of _sight_ which has something in it to interest either the heart or the head of the observer: processions, reviews, sports, and the like are _sights;_ but battles, bull-fights, or public games of any description are _spectacles_, which interest and stimulate the feelings.  
**SHOW, OUTSIDE, APPEARANCE, SEMBLANCE.** — Where there is _show_ there must be _outside_ and _appearance;_ but there may be the last without the former. The term _show_ always denotes an action, and refers to some person or thing as agent; but the _outside_ may be merely the passive quality of something. We speak, therefore, of a thing as mere _show_, to signify that what is shown is all that exists; and in this sense it may be termed mere _outside_, as consisting only of what is on the _outside._ In describing a house, however, we speak of its _outside_, and not of its _show;_ as also of the _outside_ of a book, and not of the _show. Appearance_ denotes an action as well as _show;_ but the former is the act of an unconscious agent, the latter of one that is conscious and voluntary: the _appearance_ presents itself to the view; the _show_ is purposely presented to view. A person makes a _show_ so as to be seen by others; his _appearance_ is that which shows itself in him. To look only to _show_, or to be concerned for _show_ only, signifies to be concerned for that only which will attract notice; to look only to the _outside_ signifies to be concerned only for that which may be seen in a thing, to the disregard of that which is not seen: to look only to _appearances_ signifies the same as the former, except that _outside_ is said in the proper sense of that which literally strikes the eye; but _appearances_ extend to a man's conduct and whatever may affect his reputation.  
_Semblance_, from Old French _semblance_, formed with suffix _ance_ from Latin _-antia_, on Old French _sembler_, from Latin _simulare_, to make like, always conveys the idea of an unreal, _appearance_, or at least is contrasted with that which is real; he who wears only the _semblance_ of friendship would be ill deserving the confidence of a friend.  
**SHOW, PARADE, OSTENTATION.** — These terms are synonymous when they imply abstract actions: _show_ is here, as in the preceding article, taken in the vulgar sense; _ostentation_ and _parade_ include the idea of something particular. _Show_ consists simply in letting that be seen which a person might, if he pleased, keep out of view; _parade_ is a studious effort to show, which serves to attract notice: in this manner a person may make a _show_ of his equipage or furniture who sets it out to be seen; he makes a _parade_ of his wealth if he sets it forth with any artifice or formality so as to make it more striking. _Ostentation_ is, like _parade_, a studied show, but it refers rather to the intention of the person than to the method by which the _show_ is made. _Show_ and _parade_ may, therefore, according to the circumstances, serve the purpose of _ostentation._ A person makes a _show_ of his liberality, or a _parade_ of his gifts, and thus he gratines his _ostentation._  
When taken in reference to things, the _show_ is opposed to the reality; it is that which shows itself: the _parade_ and _ostentation_ is that which is ceremonious and artificial: the former in respect to what strikes the eye, and the latter in respect to what strikes the mind.  
**SHOWY, GAUDY, GAY.** — _Showy_, having or being full of _show_, is mostly an epithet of dispraise; that which is _showy_ has seldom anything to deserve notice beyond that which catches the eye: _gaudy_, from Latin _gaudere_, to rejoice, signifies literally full of joy, and is applied figuratively to the exterior of objects, but with the annexed bad idea of being striking to an excess: _gay_, Old French _gai_, Old High German _wàhi_, fine, beautiful, is used in the same sense as an epithet of praise: it is in this sense that the _gay_ science of the Provençal troubadours was taken. Some things may be _showy_, and in their nature properly so; thus the tail of a peacock is _showy:_ artificial objects may likewise be _showy_, but they will not be preferred by persons of taste: that which is _gaudy_ is always artificial, and is always chosen by the vain, the vulgar, and the ignorant; a maid-servant will bedizen herself with _gaudy_-colored ribbons. That which is _gay_ is either nature itself or nature imitated in the best manner: spring is a _gay_ season, and flowers are its _gayest_ accompaniments.

####sick 
**SICK, SICKLY, DISEASED, MORBID.**  
_Sick_ denotes a partial state, _sickly_ a permanent state, of the body, a proneness to be _sick:_ he who is _sick_ may be made well; but he who is _sickly_ is seldom really well: all persons are liable to be _sick_, though few have the misfortune to be _sickly:_ a person may be _sick_ from the effects of cold, violent exercise, and the like; but he is _sickly_ only from constitution.  
_Sickly_ expresses a permanent state of indisposition unless otherwise qualified; but _diseased_ expresses a violent state of derangement without specifying its duration; it may be for a time only or for a permanency: the person or his constitution is _sickly;_ the person or his frame, or particular parts, as his lungs, his stomach, his brain, and the like, may be _diseased. Sick, sickly_, and _diseased_ may all be used in a moral application; _morbid_ is used in no other except in a technical sense. _Sick_ denotes a partial state, as before, namely, a state of disgust, and is always associated with the object of the _sickness;_ we are _sick_ of turbulent enjoyments, and seek for tranquillity: _sickly_ and _morbid_ are applied to the habitual state of the feelings or character; a _sickly_ sentimentality, a _morbid_ sensibility: _diseased_ is applied in general to individuals or communities, to persons or to things; a person's mind is in a _diseased_ state when it is under the influence of corrupt passions or principles; society is in a _diseased_ state when it is overgrown with wealth and luxury.  
**SICKNESS, ILLNESS, INDISPOSITION.** — _Sickness_ denotes the state of being _sick; illness_ that of being _ill_ (see [evil](entry://evil)): _indisposition_ that of being physically not well disposed. _Sickness_ denotes the state generally or particularly; _illness_ denotes it particularly: we speak of _sickness_ as opposed to good health; in _sickness_ or in health; but of the _illness_ of a particular person: when _sickness_ is said of the individual, it designates a protracted state: a person may be said to have much _sickness_ in his family. _Illness_ denotes only a particular or partial _sickness:_ a person is said to have had an _illness_ at this or that time, in this or that place, for this or that period. _Indisposition_ is a slight _illness_, such a one as is capable of disturbing him either in his enjoyments or in his business; colds are the ordinary causes of _indisposition._

####sign 
**SIGN, SIGNAL.**  
_Sign_ and _signal_ are both derived from the same source (see [mark](entry://mark)), and the latter is but a species of the former. The _sign_ enables us to recognize an object; it is, therefore, sometimes natural: _signal_ serves to give warning; it is always arbitrary. The changes which are visible in the countenance are commonly the _signs_ of what passes in the heart; the beat of the drum is the _signal_ for soldiers to repair to their post. We converse with those who are present by _signs;_ we make ourselves understood by those who are at a distance by means of _signals._  
See also [wait](entry://wait)  
**SIGNAL, MEMORABLE.** — _Signal_ signifies serving as a sign, _memorable_ signifies worthy to be remembered. They both express the idea of extraordinary, or being distinguished from every other thing: whatever is _signal_ deserves to be stamped on the mind and to serve as a sign of some property or characteristic; whatever is _memorable_ impresses upon the memory and refuses to be forgotten: the former applies to the moral character, the latter to events and times: the Scriptures furnish us with many _signal_ instances of God's vengeance against impenitent sinners, as also of His favor toward those who obey His will; the Reformation is a _memorable_ event in the annals of ecclesiastical history.  
**SIGNALIZE, DISTINGUISH.** — To _signalize_, or make one's self a sign of anything, is a much stronger term than simply to _distinguish;_ it is in the power of many to do the latter, but few only have the power of accomplishing the former: the English have always _signalized_ themselves for their unconquerable valor in battle; there is no nation that has not _distinguished_ itself, at some period or another, in war.  
**SIGNIFICANT, EXPRESSIVE.** — The _significant_ is that which serves as a sign; the _expressive_ is that which speaks out or declares; the latter is, therefore, a stronger term than the former: a look is _significant_ when it is made to _express_ an idea that passes in the mind; but it is _expressive_ when it is made to _express_ a feeling of the whole mind or heart: looks are but occasionally _significant_, but the countenance may be habitually _expressive. Significant_ is applied in an indifferent sense, according to the nature of the thing signified; but _expressive_ is always applied to that which is good: a _significant_ look may convey a very bad idea, but an _expressive_ countenance always _expresses_ good feeling.  
The distinction between these words is the same when applied to things as to persons: a word is _significant_ of whatever it is made to signify, but a word is _expressive_ according to the force with which it conveys an idea. The term _significant_, in this case, simply explains the nature, but the epithet _expressive_ characterizes it as something good: technical terms are _significant_ only of the precise ideas which belong to the art; most languages have some terms which are peculiarly _expressive_, and consequently adapted for poetry.  
**SIGNIFICATION, MEANING, IMPORT, SENSE.** — The _signification_ (see [express](entry://express)) is that which is signified to another; the _meaning_ is that which the person means to express: this latter word, therefore, is properly used in connection with the person _meaning._  
The _signification_ of a word is that which it is made to signify, and the _meaning_ is that which it is meant to express: in this sense, therefore, we may indifferently say the proper, improper, metaphorical, or general _signification_ or _meaning_ of words; but, in reference to individuals, _meaning_ is more proper than _signification_, as to convey a _meaning_, to attach a _meaning_ to a word, and not to convey or attach a _signification._  
On the other hand, it is more appropriate to say a literal _signification_ than a literal _meaning._ There is also this further distinction between _signify_ and _mean_ that the latter is applied in its proper sense to things as well as words. _Import_, from _in_ and _portare_, to carry, signifying that which is carried or conveyed to the understanding, is most allied to _signification_, inasmuch as it is applied to single words. The _signification_ may include the whole or any part of what is understood by a word; the _import_ is the whole that is comprehended under a word. The _signification_ of words may be learned by definition, but their full _import_ can be collected only from examples.  
_Sense_ (see **feeling** under [feel](entry://feel)), signifying that which is perceived by the senses, is most nearly allied to the word _meaning_, inasmuch as they both refer to the mind of the individual; but the _sense_ being that which is rational and consistent with _sense_, is that which is taken or admitted abstractedly.  
**SIGNIFY, IMPLY.** — _Signify_ (see [express](entry://express)). _Imply_, a coined word ultimately from the Latin _implicare_, to fold in, signifies to fold or involve an idea in any object.  
These terms may be employed either as respects actions or words. In the first case _signify_ is the act of the person malting known by means of a _sign_, as we _signify_ our approbation by a look; _imply_ marks the value or force of the action; our assent is _implied_ in our silence. When applied to words or marks, _signify_ denotes the positive and established act of the thing; _imply_ is its relative act: a word _signifies_ whatever it is made literally to stand for; it _implies_ that which it stands for figuratively or morally. The term house _signifies_ that which is constructed for a dwelling; the term residence _implies_ something superior to a house. A cross, thus +, _signifies_ addition in arithmetic or algebra; a long stroke, thus _—_ —, with a break in the text of a work, _implies_ that the whole sentence is not completed. It frequently happens that words which _signify_ nothing particular in themselves may be made to _imply_ a great deal by the tone, the manner, and the connection.  
**SIGNIFY, AVAIL.** — _Signify_ is here employed with regard to events of life and their relative importance. _Avail_ (see [avail](entry://avail)) is never used otherwise. That which a thing _signifies_ is what it contains; if it _signifies_ nothing, it contains nothing and is worth nothing; if it _signifies_ much, it contains much or is worth much. That which _avails_ produces; if it _avails_ nothing, it produces nothing, is of no use; if it _avails_ much, it produces or is worth much. We consider the end as to its _signification_ and the means as to their _avail._ Although it is of little or no _signification_ to a man what becomes of his remains, yet no one can be reconciled to the idea of leaving them to be exposed to contempt; words are but too often of little _avail_ to curb the unruly wills of children.

####silence 
**SILENCE, TACITURNITY.**  
The Latins have the two verbs _silere_ and _tacere:_ the former of which is interpreted by some as signifying to cease to speak, and the latter not to begin to speak; others maintain the direct contrary. According to the present use of the words, _silence_ expresses less than _taciturnity:_ the _silent_ man seldom speaks, the _taciturn_ man will not speak at all. The Latins designated the most profound _silence_ by the epithet of _taciturna silentia. Taciturnity_ is always of some duration, arising either from necessity or from a particular frame of mind.  
_Silence_ always supposes something occasional that is adopted to suit the convenience of the party.  
**SILENT, TACIT.** — _Silent_ characterizes either the person or the thing: a person is _silent_ as opposed to one that talks; a place is _silent_ as opposed to one that is noisy. _Tacit_ characterizes only the act of the person; a person gives a _tacit_ consent, or there was a _tacit_ agreement between the parties.  
**SILENT, DUMB, MUTE, SPEECHLESS.** — Not speaking is the common idea included in the signification of these terms, which differ either in the cause or the circumstance: _silent_ is altogether an indefinite and general term, expressing little more than the common idea. We may be _silent_ because we will not speak or we may be _silent_ because we cannot speak; but in distinction from the other terms it is always employed in the former case. _Dumb_, Anglo-Saxon _dumb_, Old High German _tump_, stupid or idiotic, denotes a physical incapacity to speak: hence persons are said to be born _dumb;_ they may likewise be _dumb_ from temporary physical causes, as from grief, shame, and the like; a person may be struck _dumb._ It is in the Old High German sense, which is that of the Modern German _dumm_, that the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch employ incorrectly the English _dumb. Mute_, in Latin _mutas_, dumb, signifies a temporary disability to speak from arbitrary and incidental causes: hence the office of _mutes_, or of persons who engage not to speak for a certain time; and, in like manner, persons are said to be _mute_ who dare not give utterance to their thoughts.  
_Speechless_, or void of speech, denotes a physical incapacity to speak from incidental causes; as when a person falls down _speechless_ in an apoplectic fit or in consequence of a violent concussion.  
The terms _silent, mute_, and _dumb_ are also applied to things as well as persons, the former two in the sense of not sending forth a sound; as the _silent_ grove, a _mute_ tongue, or a _mute_ letter: _dumb_, in the sense of being without words, as _dumb_ show. 

####silly

####similarity 
See [likeness](entry://likeness)

####simile 
**SIMILE, SIMILITUDE, COMPARISON.**  
_Simile_ and _similitude_ are both drawn from the Latin _similis_, like, the former signifying the thing that is like, the latter either the thing that is like or the quality of being like: in the former sense only it is to be compared with _simile_, when employed as a figure of speech or thought; everything is a _simile_ which associates objects on account of any real or supposed likeness between them; but a _similitude_ signifies a prolonged or continued _simile._ The latter may be expressed in a few words, as when we say the godlike Achilles; but the former enters into minute circumstances of _comparison_, as when Homer _compares_ any of his heroes fighting and defending themselves against multitudes to lions who are attacked by dogs and men. Every _simile_ is more or less a _comparison_, but every _comparison_ is not a _simile:_ the latter _compares_ things only as far as they are alike, but the former extends to those things which are different: in this manner, there may be a _comparison_ between large things and small, although there can be no good _simile._  
See also [likeness](entry://likeness)

####simple 
**SIMPLE, SINGLE, SINGULAR.**  
_Simple_, in Latin _simplex_, from a root _sim_, meaning the same one (appearing in _singuli, single_, etc.), and _plicare_, to fold, signifying composed of one and the same fold, is opposed to the complex, which has many folds, or to the compound, which has several parts involved or connected with each other. _Single_ and _singular_ (see [one](entry://one)) are opposed, one to double and the other to multifarious: but the latter is generally used in the sense of odd, unusual, or eccentric. We may speak of a _simple_ circumstance as independent of anything; of a _single_ instance or circumstance as unaccompanied by any other; and a _singular_ instance as one that rarely has its like. In the moral application to the person, _simplicity_, as far as it is opposed to duplicity in the heart, can never be excessive: but when it lies in the head it is a mental defect. _Singleness_ of heart and intention is that species of _simplicity_ which is altogether to be admired: _singularity_ may be either good or bad, according to circumstances; to be _singular_ in virtue is to be truly good; but to be _singular_ in manner is affectation, which is at variance with genuine _simplicity_, if not directly opposed to it.  
**SIMPLE, SILLY, FOOLISH.** — The _simple_, when applied to the understanding, implies such a contracted power as is incapable of combination; _silly_, which originally meant "timely, " hence lucky, blessed, innocent, and finally simple or foolish, and _foolish, i.e._, like a _fool_, rise in sense upon the former, signifying either the perversion or the total deficiency of understanding; the behavior of a person may be _silly_ who from any excess of feeling loses his sense of propriety; the conduct of a person will be _foolish_ who has not judgment to direct himself. Country people may be _simple_, owing to their want of knowledge; children will be _silly_ in company if they have too much liberty given to them; there are some persons who never acquire wisdom enough to prevent them from committing _foolish_ errors.  
See also NAÏVE. 

####simulation 
**SIMULATION, DISSIMULATION.**  
_Simulation_, ultimately from _similis_, is the making one's self like what one is not; and _dissimulation_, from _dissimilis_, unlike, is the making one's self appear unlike what one really is. The hypocrite affects the _simulation_ of virtue to recommend himself to the virtuous; the dissembler resorts to _dissimulation_ to conceal his vices when he wants to gain the simple or ignorant to his side.

####sincere 
**SINCERE, HONEST, TRUE, PLAIN.**  
_Sincere_ (see [candid](entry://candid)) is here the most comprehensive term: _honest_ (see [honesty](entry://honesty)), _true_, and _plain_ (see [even](entry://even)) are but modes of _sincerity. Sincerity_ is a fundamental characteristic of the person; _honesty_ is but a part of _sincerity;_ it denotes simply the absence of intentional or fraudulent concealment; we look for a _sincere_ friend to tell us everything; we look for an _honest_ companion who will speak without disguise; truth is a characteristic of _sincerity_, for a _sincere_ friend is a _true_ friend; but _sincerity_ is, properly speaking, only a mode of truth. _Sincere_ and _honest_ are personal characteristics; _true_ is a characteristic of the thing, as a _sincere_ man, an _honest_ confession, a _true_ statement.  
A _sincere_ man must needs be _plain_, because _plainness_ consists in an unvarnished style; and the _sincere_ man will always adopt that mode of speech which expresses his sentiments most truly; but a person may be occasionally _plain_ in his speech who is not so from _sincerity._ The _plain_, whether it respects the language or the conduct, is that which is divested of everything extraneous or artificial, and so far _plainness_ is an auxiliary to _truth_ by enabling the _truth_ to be better seen.

####situation 
**SITUATION, CONDITION, STATE, PREDICAMENT, FLIGHT, CASE.**  
_Situation_ (see [place](entry://place)) is said generally of objects as they concern others; _condition_, as they are concerned themselves: our _situation_ consists of those external circumstances in respect of property, honor, liberty, and the like which affect our standing in society generally. Whatever affects our person immediately is our _condition:_ a person who is unable to pay a sum of money to save himself from a prison is in a bad _situation:_ a traveller who is left in a ditch robbed and wounded is in a bad _condition. Situation_ and _condition_ are said of that which is contingent and changeable, the latter still more so than the former; _state_, from the past participle of _stare_, to stand, signifying that position in which one stands, is said of that which is comparatively stable or established. A tradesman is in a good _situation_ who is in the way of carrying on a good trade: his affairs are in a good _state_ if he is enabled to answer every demand and to keep up his credit. Hence it is that we speak of the _state_ of health and the _state_ of the mind, not the _situation_ or _condition_, because the body and mind are considered as to their general frame, and not as to any relative or particular circumstances, as the passing _condition_ of one's health or transient disposition of one's mentality, so likewise a _state_ of infancy, a _state_ of guilt, a _state_ of innocence.  
When speaking of bodies, there is the same distinction in the terms as in regard to individuals. An army may be either in a _situation_, a _condition_, or a _state._ An army that is on service may be in a critical _situation_ with respect to the enemy and its own comparative weakness; it may be in a deplorable _condition_ if it stand in need of provisions and necessaries: an army that is at home will be in a good or bad _state_ according to the regulations of the commander-in-chief. Of a prince who is threatened with invasion from foreign enemies and with rebellion from his subjects we should not say that his _condition_, but his _situation_, was critical. Of a prince, however, who like Alfred was obliged to fly and to seek safety in disguise and poverty, we should speak of his hard _condition:_ the _state_ of a prince cannot be spoken of, but the _state_ of his affairs and government may: hence, likewise, _state_ may with most propriety be said of a nation: but _situation_ seldom, unless in respect to other nations, and _condition_ never. On the other hand, when speaking of the poor, we seldom employ the term _situation_, because they are seldom considered as a body in relation to other bodies: we mostly speak of their _condition_ as better or worse, according as they have more or less of the comforts of life; and of their _state_ as regards their moral habits.  
These terms may likewise be applied to inanimate objects; and, upon the same grounds, a house is in a good _situation_ as respects the surrounding objects; it is in a good or bad _condition_ as respects the painting and exterior altogether; it is in a bad _state_ as respects the beams, plaster, roof, and interior structure altogether. The hand of a watch is in a different _situation_ every hour; the watch itself may be in a bad _condition_ if the wheels are clogged with dirt, but in a good _state_ if the works are altogether sound and fit for service.  
_Situation_ and _condition_ are either permanent or temporary. The _predicament_, originally a term in logic signifying one of the most general classes into which things can be divided, from Latin _prœdicare_, to assert or declare, signifies that which is predicated or asserted; a class or kind described by definite marks, originally it had no unfavorable connotation, but in modern parlance, when applied to circumstances, it expresses a temporary embarrassed _situation_ conceivably but not necessarily occasioned by an act of one's own: hence we speak of being in or bringing ourselves into a _predicament. Plight_, in the sense of peril, is derived from Anglo-Saxon _pliht_, risk, danger, hence also a promise involving risk or peril: it has no connection with the English _plight_ in the sense of fold, which is derived from the Latin _plicatus_, participle of _plicare_, to fold. It signifies any circumstance in which one is disagreeably entangled. _Case_ signifies anything which may befall us or into which we fall, from _casus_, past participle of _cadere_, to fall, mostly, though not necessarily, contrary to our inclination. Those latter two terms, therefore, denote a species of temporary _condition_, for they both express that which happens to the object itself, without reference to any other. A person is in an unpleasant _situation_ who is shut up in a railway compartment with disagreeable company. He is in an awkward _predicament_ when, in attempting to please one friend, he displeases another. He may be in a wretched _plight_ if he is overturned in a car at night and at a distance from any habitation. He will be in evil case if he is compelled to put up with a spare and poor diet.

####size 
**SIZE, MAGNITUDE, GREATNESS, BULK.**  
_Size_ is short for _assize_, from _assise_, the feminine past participle of the French verb _asseoir_, to sit: from its meaning of the sitting of judges came the tax by them established, hence a fixed amount, and thence it developed the meaning of quantity or size in general; it is a general term including all manner of dimension or measurement; _magnitude_, from the Latin _magnitude_, from _magnus_, great, answering, literally, to the English word _greatness_, is employed in science or in an abstract sense to denote some specific measurement; _greatness_ is an unscientific term applied in the same sense to objects in general: _size_ is indefinite, it never characterizes anything either as large or small; but _magnitude_ and _greatness_ always suppose something _great;_ and _bulk_ denotes a considerable degree of _greatness:_ things which are diminutive in _size_ will often have an extraordinary degree of beauty or some other adventitious perfection to compensate the deficiency; astronomers have classed the stars according to their different _magnitudes; greatness_ has been considered as one source of the sublime; _bulk_ is that species of _greatness_ which destroys the symmetry, and consequently the beauty, of objects. 

####sketch 
**SKETCH, OUTLINES.**  
A _sketch_ may form a whole; _outlines_ are but a part: the _sketch_ may comprehend the _outlines_ and some of the particulars; _outlines_, as the term bespeaks, comprehend only the line on the exterior: the _sketch_, in drawing, may serve as a landscape, as it presents some of the features of a country; but the _outlines_ serve only as bounding lines, within which the _sketch_ may be formed. So in the moral application, we speak of the _sketches_ of countries, characters, manners, and the like, which serve as a description; but of the _outlines_ of a plan, of a work, a project, and the like which serve as a basis on which the subordinate parts are to be formed: barbarous nations present us with rude _sketches_ of nature; an abridgment is little more than the _outlines_ of a larger work.

####skin 
**SKIN, HIDE, PEEL, RIND.**  
_Skin_, a Scandinavian word, is the term in most general use; it is applicable both to human creatures and to animals: _hide_, Anglo-Saxon _hýd_, allied to Latin _cutis_, skin (whence _cuticle)_, is used only for the _skins_ of large animals: we speak of the _skins_ of birds or insects, but of the _hides_ of oxen or horses and other animals, which are to be separated from the body and converted into leather. _Skin_ is equally applied to the inanimate and the animate world, but _peel_, Latin _pellis_, a skin, and _rind_, Anglo-Saxon _rinde_, the bark of a tree, possibly allied to _rim_, signifying that which goes round and envelops, belong only to inanimate objects: the _skin_ is generally said of that which is interior, in distinction from the exterior, which is the _peel:_ an orange has both its _peel_ and its thin _skin_ underneath; an apple, a pear, and the like has a _peel._ The _peel_ is a soft substance on the outside; the _rind_ is generally interior and of a harder substance: in regard to a stick, we speak of its _peel_ and its inner _skin;_ in regard to a tree, we speak of its bark and its _rind:_ hence, likewise, the term _rind_ is applied to cheese and other incrusted substances that envelop bodies. 

####slack 
**SLACK, LOOSE.**  
_Slack_, Anglo-Saxon _sleac_, meant originally fluid. _Loose_ is a Scandinavian word allied to the verb _lose._ These two words differ more in application than in sense: they are both opposed to that which is close bound; but _slack_ is said only of that which is tied or that with which anything is tied; while _hose_ is said of any substances the parts of which do not adhere closely: a rope is _slack_ in contrast with the tight rope, which is stretched to its full extent; and in general cords or strings are said to be _slack_ which fail in the requisite degree of tightness; but they are said to be _loose_ in an indefinite manner, without conveying any collateral idea: thus the string of an instrument is denominated _slack_ rather than _loose;_ on the other hand, _loose_ is said of many bodies to which the word _slack_ cannot be applied: a garment is _loose_, but not _slack;_ the leg of a table is _hose_, but not _slack._  
In the moral application, that which admits of additional activity is denominated _slack_, and that which fails in consistency and close adherence is _hose:_ trade is _slack_, or a person's zeal, etc., becomes _slack_ (hence the term of reproach _slacker_, which arose during the European war to denote persons unwilling to work to help the allied countries to victory); but an engagement is _loose_ and principles are _loose._

####slant 
**SLANT, SLOPE.**  
_Slant_ is a Scandinavian word, meaning to slope or glide, and _slope_, from the root found in the verb _slip_, are both expressive of a sideward movement or direction: they are the same in sense, but different in application: _slant_ is said of small bodies only; _slope_ is said indifferently of all bodies, large and small: a book may be made to _slant_ by lying in part on another book on a desk or a table, but a piece of ground is said to _slope._

####sleep 
**SLEEP, SLUMBER, DOZE, DROWSE, NAP.**  
_Sleep_ is in Anglo-Saxon _slœpan. Slumber_ comes through Middle English _slumeren_, from a Teutonic root meaning to be silent. _Doze_ is a Scandinavian word allied to _dizzy_ and to _daze. Drowse_ comes from the Anglo-Saxon _drúsian_, to be sluggish. _Nap_ is in Anglo-Saxon _hnœppian_, to doze.  
_Sleep_ is the general term, which designates in an indefinite manner that state of the body to which all animated beings are subject at certain seasons in the course of nature; to _slumber_ is to _sleep_ lightly and softly; to _doze_ is to incline to _sleep_ or to begin _sleeping;_ to _nap_ is to _sleep_ for a time: every one who is not indisposed _sleeps_ during the night; those who are accustomed to wake at a certain hour of the morning commonly _slumber_ only after that time; there are many who, though they cannot _sleep_ in a carriage, will yet be obliged to _doze_ if they travel in the night; in hot climates the middle of the day is commonly chosen for a _nap._  
**SLEEPY, DROWSY, LETHARGIC.** — _Sleepy_ expresses either a temporary or a permanent state. _Drowsy_ expresses mostly a temporary state; _lethargic_, from _lethargy_, in Latin _lethargia_, Greek _ληθαργία_, compounded of _λήθη_, forgetfulness, signifying a proneness to forgetfulness or _sleep_, describes a permanent or habitual state.  
_Sleepy_, as a temporary state, expresses also what is natural or seasonable; _drowsiness_ expresses an inclination to _sleep_ at unseasonable hours; it is natural to be _sleepy_ at the hour when we are accustomed to retire to rest; it is common to be _drowsy_ when sitting still after dinner. _Sleepiness_, as a permanent state, is an infirmity to which some persons are subject constitutionally; _lethargy_ is a disease with which people otherwise the most wakeful may be occasionally attacked.

####slip 
**SLIP, SLIDE, GLIDE.**  
_Slip_, from _slipan_, and _slide_, from _slidan_, and _glide_, from _glidan_, are all Anglo-Saxon words.  
To _slip_ is an involuntary, and _slide_ a voluntary, motion: those who go on the ice in fear will _slip;_ boys _slide_ on the ice by way of amusement. To _slip_ and _slide_ are lateral movements of the feet, but to _glide_ is the movement of the whole body and just that easy motion which is made by _slipping, sliding_, flying, or swimming: a person _glides_ along the surface of the ice when he _slides;_ a vessel _glides_ through the water.  
In the moral and figurative application, a person _slips_ who commits unintentional errors; he who wittingly, and yet without difficulty, falls into the practice and habits which are recommended _slides_ into a certain course of life: he _glides_ through life if he pursues his course smoothly and without interruption.

####slow 
**SLOW, DILATORY, TARDY, TEDIOUS.**  
_Slow_, in Anglo-Saxon _sláw_, may be allied to _lœves_, in Latin signifying the left hand, the left hand being slow of movement. _Dilatory_, of the same derivation as the English _dilate_, comes from Latin _di-dis_, apart, and _latus_, carried, the past participle of _ferre, i.e., ΑΤΙ_ action which is put off and brought over from the time of its conception or requirement. It means lengthening out the time required for any performance. _Tardy_, from the Latin _tardus_, signifies, literally, slow. _Tedious_, from the Latin _tœdium_, weariness, signifies causing weariness.  
_Slow_ is a general and unqualified term applicable to the motion of any object or to the motions and actions of persons in particular, and to their dispositions also; _dilatory_ relates to the disposition only of persons: we are _slow_ in what we are about; we are _dilatory_ in setting about a thing. _Slow_ is applied to corporeal or mental actions; a person may be _slow_ in walking or _slow_ in conceiving: _tardy_ is applicable to mental actions; we are _tardy_ in our proceedings or our progress; we are _tardy_ in making up accounts or in concluding a treaty. We may be _slow_ with propriety or not, to our own inconvenience or that of others; when we are _tedious_ we are always so improperly: "To be _slow_ and sure" is a vulgar proverb, but a great truth; by this we do ourselves good and inconvenience no one; but he who is _tedious_ is _slow_ to the annoyance of others: a prolix writer must always be _tedious_, for he keeps the reader long in suspense before he comes to the conclusion of a period.

####smear 
**SMEAR, DAUB.**  
_Smear_ is allied to Anglo-Saxon _smerien_, a weak verb from the substantive _smeru_ fat or grease, and originally signified to cover with fat or grease. _Daub_ comes from Old French _dauber_, to plaster, from Latin _de_, down, and _albare_, to whiten.  
To _smear_ in the literal sense is applied to such substances as may be rubbed like grease over a body; if said of grease itself, it may be. proper; as coachmen _smear_ the coach-wheels with tar or grease; but if said of anything else, it is an improper action, and tends to disfigure, as children _smear_ their hands with ink or _smear_ their clothes with dirt. To _smear_ and _daub_ are both actions which tend to disfigure; but we _smear_ by means of _rubbing_ over; we _daub_ by rubbing, throwing, or any way covering over: thus a child _smears_ the window with his finger or he _daubs_ the wall with dirt.  
By a figurative application _smear_ is applied to bad writing or whatever is soiled or contaminated, and _daub_ to bad painting or to whatever is executed coarsely or clumsily: indifferent writers who wish to excel are fond of retouching their letters until they make their performance a sad _smear;_ bad artists, who are injudicious in the use of their brush, load their paintings with color and convert them into _daubs._

####smell 
**SMELL, SCENT, ODOR, PERFUME, FRAGRANCE.**  
_Smell_, Middle English _smel_, is allied to _smoulder. Scent_, changed from _sent_, comes from the Latin _sentire_, to perceive or feel. _Odor_, in Latin _odor_, allied with Greek _όζειν_, to smell. _Perfume_, compounded of _per_ and _fumus_, a smoke or vapor, that is, the vapor that issues forth. _Fragrance_, in Latin _fragrantia_, comes from _fragrare_, to emit an odor; hence, in Latin, _fragum_, a strawberry.  
_Smell_ and _scent_ are said either of that which receives or that which gives the _smell;_ the _odor_, the _perfume_, and _fragrance_, of that which communicates the _smell._ In the first case, _smell_ is said generally of all living things without distinction; _scent_ is said only of such animals as have this peculiar faculty of tracing objects by their _smell:_ some persons have a much quicker _smell_ than others, and some have an acuter _smell_ of particular objects than they have of things in general: dogs are remarkable for their quickness of _scent_, by which they can trace their masters and other objects at an immense distance; other animals are gifted with this faculty to a surprising degree, which serves them as a means of defence against their enemies.  
In the second case, _smell_ and _scent_ are compared with _odor, perfume_, and _fragrance_ either as respects the objects communicating the _smell_ or the nature of the _smell_ which is communicated. _Smell_ is indefinite in its sense and universal in its application; _scent, odor, perfume_, and _fragrance_ are species of _smell:_ every object is said to _smell_ which acts on the olfactory nerves; flowers, fruits, woods, earth, water, and the like have a _smell; scent_ is most commonly applied to the _smell_ which proceeds from animal bodies; the _odor_ is said of that which is artificial or extraneous; the _perfume_ and _fragrance_ of that which is natural: the burning of things produces an _odor;_ the _perfume_ and _fragrance_ arises from flowers or _sweet-smelling_ herbs, spices, and the like. The terms _smell_ and _odor_ do not specify the exact nature of that which issues from bodies; they may both be either pleasant or unpleasant; but _smell_, if taken in certain connections, signifies a bad _smell_, and _odor_ signifies that which is sweet: meat which is kept too long will have a _smell_, that is, of course, a bad _smell;_ the _odors_ from a sacrifice are acceptable, that is, the sweet odors ascend to heaven. _Perfume_ is properly a wide-spreading _smell_, and when taken without any epithet never signifies anything but what is good; it is the sweetest and most powerful _perfume:_ the _perfume_ from flowers and shrubs is as grateful to one sense as then colors and conformation are to the other; the _fragrance_ from groves of myrtle and orange trees surpasses the beauty of their fruit or foliage.

####snub 
**SNUB, CUT, SLIGHT.**  
These words all signify to treat another with contempt. _Slight_ means to treat as if of _slight_ importance. We may _slight_ a friend indirectly by failing to invite him to a social entertainment or to consult his wishes in some matter in which he feels that he has a right to an opinion. _Snub, the_ original meaning of which is to cut off, something short, indicates a more crude and direct action. We _snub_ another by obviously disregarding him or treating him with contempt. To _cut_ is to _cut_ a friend or acquaintance out of the circle of our interests entirely. We may _slight_ an acquaintance by treating him with less consideration than he expects. We _snub_ him by treating him with a positive lack of respect or consideration. We _cut_ him by disregarding him altogether, by failing to recognize his existence at all.

####soak 
**SOAK, DRENCH, STEEP.**  
_Soak_, from Anglo-Saxon _socian_, is related to _suck. Steep_ is a Scandinavian word meaning to make to _sloop_, to overturn, hence to pour water over grain by turning the receptacle upside down. _Drench_ is a variation of drink; it means, literally, to cause to drink.  
The idea of communicating or receiving a liquid is common to these terms. A person's clothes are _soaked_ in rain when the water has penetrated every thread; he himself is _drenched_ in the rain when it has penetrated, as it were, his very body; _drench_, therefore, in this case only expresses the idea of _soak_ in a stronger manner. To _steep_ is a species of _soaking_ employed as an artificial process; to _soak_ is, however, a permanent action by which hard things are rendered soft; to _steep_ is a temporary action by which soft bodies become penetrated with a liquid: thus salt meat requires to be _soaked;_ fruits are _steeped_ in brandy. 

####sober 
**SOBER, GRAVE.**  
(_Sober_ (see **abstinent** under [abstain](entry://abstain)) expresses the absence of all exhilaration of spirits: _grave_ (see that word) expresses a weight in the intellectual operations which makes them proceed slowly. _Sobriety_ is therefore a more natural and ordinary state for the human mind than _gravity:_ it behooves every man to be sober in all situations; but those who fill the most important stations of life must be _grave._ Even in our pleasures we may observe _sobriety_, which keeps us from any excessive ebullition of mirth; but on particular occasions, where the importance of the subject ought to weigh on the mind, it becomes us to be _grave._ At a feast we have need of _sobriety;_ at a funeral we have need of _gravity. Sobriety_ extends to many more objects than _gravity;_ we must be _sober_ in our thoughts and opinions, as well as in our outward conduct and behavior; but we can be _grave_, properly speaking, only in our looks and our outward deportment.

####social 
**SOCIAL, SOCIABLE.**  
_Social_, from _socius_, a companion, signifies belonging or allied to a companion, having the disposition of a companion; _sociable_, from the same, signifies able or fit to be a companion; the former is an active, the latter a passive, quality: _social_ people seek others; _sociable_ people are sought for by others. It is possible for a man to be _social_ and not _sociable;_ to be _sociable_ and not _social:_ he who draws his pleasures from society without communicating his share to the common stock of entertainments is _social_, but not _sociable;_ men of a taciturn disposition are often in this case; they receive more than they give: he, on the contrary, who has talents to please company, but not the inclination to go into company, may be _sociable_, but is seldom _social;_ of this description are humorists who go into company to gratify their pride and stay away to indulge their humor.  
_Social_ and _sociable_ are likewise applicable to things, with a similar distinction; _social_ intercourse is that intercourse which men have together for the purposes of society; _social_ pleasures are what they enjoy by associating together: a family is _sociable;_ fellow-travellers are _sociable:_ a church gives a _sociable._

####socialism 
**SOCIALISM, COMMUNISM.**  
Both of these words indicate a theory of government which holds that necessities of life should not be wholly in the control of the individuals strong enough to take possession of them, but should be equitably distributed by some central authority acting in accordance with the will of the whole community. But _communism_, from Latin _communis_, common, holds that all goods should be held in common, that the possessions or earnings of each individual should go into a common fund to be redistributed in accordance with the needs of all the members composing the community. This system has been carried out in some special social groups — in the monasteries, for example — and, to some extent, in the organization of the Russian _Zemstva_, and it obtains today in many families, especially those of the working classes. But it has never been successfully extended to the large and various community composing a state. _Socialism_, on the other hand, simply provides that all that is necessary to support life — _i.e._, land and the machinery of production — shall be under the control of the community as a whole, so that no individual shall have it in his power to buy up any of the crops, like wheat, which are necessary to support life, and to control the selling price, or to keep in his possession large tracts of land not under cultivation, etc. _Socialists_ differ in their ideas concerning the character and extent of the communal control; and _socialism_ is often associated with doctrines of _pacifism_, etc., which bring it into disrepute. But, as a matter of fact, in moments of crisis, when national existence is threatened, the _socialistic_ principle of the control of that which is necessary for the welfare of the whole community by the whole community, is promptly applied — as in the food-control regulations in the warring countries during the European war, and the regulation of conscription in the United States.

####society 
**SOCIETY, COMPANY.**  
_Society_ and _company_ (for both see **association** under [associate](entry://associate)) here express either the persons associating, the act of associating, or the state of being associated. In either case _society_ is a general and _company_ a particular term; as respects persons associating, _society_ comprehends either all the associated part of mankind, as when we speak of the laws of _society_, the well-being of _society;_ or it is said only of a particular number of individuals associated, in which latter case it comes nearest to _company_, and differs from it only as to the purpose of the association. A _society_ is always formed for some solid purpose, as the Humane _Society;_ and a _company_ is always brought together for pleasure or profit, as has already been observed. Good sense teaches us the necessity of conforming to the rules of the _society_ to which we belong: good-breeding prescribes to us to render ourselves agreeable to the _company_ of which we form a part.  
When expressing the abstract action of associating, the term _society_ is even more general and indefinite than before; it expresses that which is common to mankind, and _company_ that which is peculiar to individuals. The love of _society_ is inherent in our nature; it is weakened or destroyed only by the defect of our disposition or by some mental or psychological derangement: every one naturally likes the _company_ of his own friends and connections in preference to that of strangers. _Society_ is a permanent and habitual act; _company_ is only a particular act suited to the occasion: it behooves us to shun the _society_ of those from whom we can learn no good, although we may sometimes be obliged to be in their _company._ The _society_ of intelligent men is desirable for those who are entering life; the _company_ of facetious men is agreeable in travelling.

####soft 
**SOFT, MILD, GENTLE, MEEK.**  
_Soft_ and _mild_ have the same form and application in Anglo-Saxon as in Modern English. _Gentle_ (see that word). _Meek_ is a Scandinavian word.  
All these terms denote the absence of an unpleasant action, sometimes also a positively pleasant action, and sometimes a positive readiness to yield to the action of other bodies. _Soft_ is taken in these different senses, as a _soft_ pressure or tread which is not easily felt or heard, and a _soft_ substance that yields readily to the touch or pressure. _Mild_ and _gentle_ are mostly taken in the sense of not acting with an unpleasant force; as _mild_ cheese, or _mild_ fruits, _gentle_ motion. _Meek_ is taken in the passive sense of not resisting force by force. The first three terms have a physical and moral application; the last only a moral application. _Soft_ is applied to such objects as act pleasantly in point of strength on the ear or the eye, as a _soft_ voice, a _soft_ light; or pleasantly, in point of smoothness, on the feeling, as a _soft_ cushion, a _soft_ skin. _Mild_ and _gentle_ are applied to objects that act not unpleasantly on the senses; as _mild_ beer, not too strong either for the palate or the body; _mild_ air, that is, not unpleasantly cold; _gentle_ exercise, _gentle_ motion, not violent or excessive in degree: so a _gentle_ stream and a _gentle_ rain. These terms are, agreeably to this distinction, applied to the same objects; a _soft_ voice, _soft_ music, as that which is positively pleasant; a _gentle_ voice is one not loud.  
A _soft_ air or climate is positively pleasant; a _mild_ air or climate is simply without any undue cold; a _gentle_ wind is opposed to one that is boisterous.  
_Soft_ is sometimes applied to motion in the purely negative sense; as a _soft_ step, _i.e._, one made without great pressure of the foot; a _gentle_ motion is one that is made slowly, not quick. It is necessary to tread _softly_ when no noise is to be made, and to move _gently_ when one is ill.  
So likewise when these terms are applied to objects that act on the moral feelings, they admit of a similar distinction. Words are either _soft, mild_, or _gentle; soft_ words are calculated to soften or dimmish the angry feeling of others. The proverb says, "A _soft_ answer turneth away wrath. " A reproof is _mild_, inasmuch as it does not wound the feelings; a censure, or admonition, or reproach, is _gentle_, inasmuch as it is free from asperity. So likewise punishments are _mild_ that inflict little pain; means of coercion are _gentle_ that are not violent. Manners are _soft, mild_, and _gentle_, but _softness_ in this case is not always commendable. Too much _softness_ in the manners of a man is inconsistent with manly firmness. _Mildness_ and _gentleness_ are more generally commendable. _Mild_ manners are peculiarly becoming in superiors or those who have the power of controlling others, provided they do not interfere with good order. _Gentle_ manners are becoming in all persons who take a part in social life. _Softness_ of manner may likewise be assumed, but _mildness_ and. _gentleness_ are always genuine, the former arising from the temper, the latter either from the temper or from good-breeding, of which it is the greatest mark.  
When these terms are employed as characteristics of the person or his disposition, they are comparable with _meek_, which is used only in this sense. _Soft_, as far as it denotes a susceptibility of _soft_ or tender emotions, may and ought to exist in both sexes; but it ought to be the peculiar characteristic of the female sex; _mildness_, as a natural gift, may disqualify a man for command, unless it be tempered by firmness and discretion. _Gentleness_, as a part of the character, is not so much to be recommended as _gentleness_ from habit.  
_Meekness_ denotes the forbearance to use force, even in cases of peculiar provocation: in those who are called upon to direct or command it may be carried to an excess.  
_Gentle, mild_, and _meek_ are likewise applied to animals, the former to designate that easy flow of spirits which fits them for being guided in their movements, and the latter to mark that passive temper that submits to every kind of treatment, however harsh, without an indication even of displeasure. A horse is _gentle, as_ opposed to one that is spirited; the former is devoid of that impetus in himself to move which renders the other ungovernable: the lamb is a pattern of _meekness_, and yields to the knife of the butcher without a struggle or a groan.

Solicitation_ itself is that which gives trouble to a certain extent, but it is not always unreasonable: there may be cases in which we may yield to the _solicitations_ of friends, to do that which we have no objection to be obliged to do; but _importunity_ is that _solicitation_ which never ceases to apply for that which it is not agreeable to give. We may sometimes be urgent in our _solicitations_ of a friend to accept some proffered honor; the _solicitation_, however, in this case, although it may even be troublesome, yet is sweetened by the motive of the action: the _importunity_ of beggars is often a deliberate means of extorting money from the traveller.

####solitary 
**SOLITARY, SOLE, ONLY, SINGLE.**  
All these terms are more or less opposed to several or many. _Solitary_ and _sole_, both derived from _solus_, alone or whole, signify a thing left by itself; the former mostly in application to particular sensible objects, the latter in regard mostly to moral objects: a _solitary_ shrub expresses not only one shrub, but one that has been left to itself: the _sole_ cause or reason signifies that reason or cause which stands unsupported by anything else. _Only_, that is, _onely_, signifying the quality of unity, does not include the idea of desertion or deprivation, but it comprehends that of want or deficiency: he who has _only_ one shilling in his pocket means to imply that he wants more or ought to have more. _Single_, which is an abbreviation of _singular_ (see [simple](entry://simple)), signifies simply one or more detached from others, without conveying any other collateral idea: a _single_ sheet of paper may be sometimes more convenient than a double one; a _single_ shilling may be all that is necessary for the present purpose: there may be _single_ ones, as well as a _single_ one; but the other terms exclude the idea of there being anything else. A _solitary_ act of generosity is not sufficient to characterize a man as generous: with most criminals the _sole_ ground of their defence rests upon their not having learned to know and do better: harsh language and severe looks are not the _only_ means of correcting the faults of others: _single_ instances of extraordinary talents now and then present themselves in the course of an age.  
In the adverbial form, _solely_, only, and _singly_ are employed with a similar distinction. The disasters which attend an unsuccessful military enterprise are seldom to be attributed _solely_ to the incapacity of the general: there are many circumstances both in the natural and moral world which are to be accounted for _only_ by admitting a Providence as presented to us in Divine revelation: there are many things which men could not effect _singly_ that might be effected by them conjointly.

**SOLITARY, DESERT, DESOLATE.** - _Solitary_ (see above). _Desert_ is the same as _deserted_, from Latin _desertus, de_, privative, and the past participle of _serere_, to join, meaning disjoined, abandoned, forsaken. _Desolate_, in Latin _desolatus_, signifies made _solitary._  
All these epithets are applied to places, but with different modifications of the common idea of solitude which belongs to them. _Solitary_ simply denotes the absence of all beings of the same kind: thus a place is _solitary_ to a man where there is no human being but himself; and it is _solitary_ to a brute when there are no brutes with which it can hold society. _Desert_ conveys the idea of a place made _solitary_ by being shunned, from its unfitness as a place of residence. All _deserts_ are places of such wildness as seem to frighten away almost all inhabitants. _Desolate_ conveys the idea of a place made _solitary_, or bare of inhabitants, and all traces of habitation, by violent means: _desolation_ is solitude coupled with wretchedness; every country may become _desolate_ which is exposed to the inroads of a ravaging army, and a person may be _desolate_ who feels himself unable to associate with others. 

####solve 
**SOLVE, RESOLVE.**  
_Solve_ and _resolve_ both come from the Latin _solvere_, to loosen.  
Between _solve_ and _resolve_ there is no considerable difference either in sense or application: the former seems merely to speak of unfolding in a general manner that which is wrapped up in obscurity; to _resolve_ is rather to unfold it by the particular method of carrying one _back (re-)_ to first principles; we _solve_ a problem and _resolve_ a difficulty. 

####some 
**SOME, ANY.**  
_Some_, Anglo-Saxon _sum_, allied to _same_, is altogether restrictive in its sense: _any_, Anglo-Saxon _œnig (an_, one, with suffix _ig)_, signifying _a one_, is altogether universal and indefinite. _Some_ applies to one particular part in distinction from the rest: _any_ to every individual part without distinction. _Some_ think this and others that: _any_ person might believe if he would; _any_ one can conquer his passions if he uses his will-power. In consequence of this distinction in sense, _some_ can be used only in particular affirmative propositions; but _any_, which is equivalent to all, may be either in negative, interrogative, or hypothetical propositions: _some_ say so: does _any_ one believe it? He will not give to _any._

####soon 
**SOON, ΕABLY, BETIMES. **  
All these words are expressive of time; but _soon_ respects some future period in general; _early_, or _ere_, before, and _betimes_, or by the time, before a given time, respect some particular period at no great distance. A person may come _soon_ or _early;_ in the former case he may not be long in coming from the time that the words are spoken; in the latter case he comes before the time appointed. He who rises _soon_ does nothing extraordinary; but he who rises _early_ or _betimes_ exceeds the usual hour considerably. _Soon_ is said mostly of particular acts, and is always dated from the time of the person speaking, if not otherwise expressed; come _soon_ signifies after the present moment: _early_ and _betimes_, if not otherwise expressed, have always respect to some specific time appointed; come _early_ will signify a visit, a meeting, and the like; do it _betimes_ will signify before the thing to be done is wanted: in this manner, both are employed for the actions of youth. An _early_ attention to duties will render them habitual and pleasing; we must begin _betimes_ to bring the stubborn will into subjection.

####sophistry 
**SOPHISTRY, FALLACY.**  
_Sophistry_ comes from Greek _σοφιστής_, a teacher of arts and sciences for money; a pretended lover of wisdom. It derives its name from the so-called _sophists_, the teachers of rhetoric, who travelled from city to city imparting the secrets of plausible and convincing speech, making "the worse appear the better cause. " _Sophistry_ applies to an argument or reason which has a deceptive appearance of rationality and truth; _fallacy_, from Latin _fallax_, deceitful, to a general statement which seems to be true partly because it has been generally accepted without question. _Sophistry is_ often founded on a _fallacy_, that is, it is a chain of argument that is deceptive, beginning with a general statement, a _fallacy_, which seems to be true, but is not.

####sorrow 
See **affliction** under [afflict](entry://afflict)

####sorry 
**SORRY, GRIEVED, HURT.**  
_Sorry_ and _grieved_ are epithets somewhat differing from their primitives _sorrow_ and _grief_ (see **affliction** under [afflict](entry://afflict)), inasmuch as they are applied to ordinary subjects. We speak of being _sorry_ for anything, however trivial, which concerns ourselves; but we are commonly _grieved_ for that which concerns others. I am _sorry_ that I was not at home when a person called upon me; I am _grieved_ that it is not in my power to serve a friend who stands in need. Both these terms connote only that which we do ourselves: _hurt_ (see [displease ](entry://displease )and INJURY) that which is done to us, denoting painful feeling from _hurt_ or wounded feelings; we are _hurt_ at being treated with disrespect. 

####sort 
See [kind](entry://kind)

####soul 
**SOUL, MIND.**  
These terms, or the equivalents to them, have been employed by all civilized nations to designate that part of human nature which is presumed to be distinct from matter. The _soul_, however, from Anglo-Saxon _sáwel_, is probably from a Sanskrit root meaning _light._ Like the _anima_ of the Latin, which comes from the Greek _άνεμος_, wind or breath, it is represented to our minds by the subtlest or most ethereal of sensible objects, namely, breath or spirit, and denotes properly the quickening or vital principle. _Mind_, on the contrary, from Anglo-Saxon _gemynd_, is that sort of power which is closely allied to, and in a great measure dependent upon, corporeal organization: the former is, therefore, the immortal, and the latter the mortal, part of us; the former connects us with spirits, the latter with brutes; in the former we distinguish consciousness and will, which is possessed by no other created being that we know of; in the latter we distinguish nothing but the power of receiving impressions from external objects, which we call ideas, and which we have in common with the brutes. Poets and philosophers speak of the _soul_ in the same strain, as the active and living principle.  
The ancients, though unaided by the light of Divine revelation, yet represented the _soul_ as a distinct principle. The Psyche of the Greeks, which was the name they gave to the human _soul_, was feigned to be one of their incorporeal or celestial beings. The _anima_ of the Latins was taken precisely in the modern sense of the _soul_, by which it was distinguished from the _animus_ or mind. Thus the Emperor Hadrian is said on his dying bed to have addressed his soul in words which clearly denote what he thought of its independent existence.  
The _mind_, being considered as an attribute to the _soul_, is taken sometimes for one faculty and sometimes for another; as for the understanding, when we say a person is not in his right _mind:_ sometimes for the intellectual power; or for the intellectual capacity; or for the imagination or conception.  
Sometimes the word _mind_ is employed to denote the operations of the thinking faculty, the thoughts or opinions; or the will, choice, determination, as in the colloquial phrase, to have a _mind_ to do a thing.  
Sometimes it stands for the memory, as in the familiar expressions to call to _mind_, put in _mind_, etc.  
Lastly, the _mind_ is considered as the seat of all the faculties, and also of the passions or affections.  
The _soul_, being the better part of a man, is taken for the man's self; as Horace says, in allusion to his friend Virgil, "et serves animai dimidium meæ"; hence the term is figuratively extended, in its application, to denote a human being, or the individual in general. Also, what is excellent, the essential or principal part of a thing, the spirit. 

####sound 
**SOUND, SANE, HEALTHY.**  
_Sound_ is the Anglo-Saxon word, _sund_, corresponding to Latin _sanus_, whence _sane_ is derived. _Healthy_ (see that word).  
_Sound_ is extended in its application to all things that are in the state in which they ought to be, so as to preserve their vitality; thus animals and vegetables are said to be _sound_ when in the former there is nothing amiss in their breath, and in the latter in their root. By a figurative application, wood and other things may be said to be _sound_ when they are entirely free from any symptom of decay; _sane_ is applicable to human beings, in the same sense, but with reference to the mind; a _sane_ person is opposed to one that is insane. The mind is also said to be _sound_ when it is in a perfect state to form right opinions.  
_Healthy_ expresses more than either _sound_ or _sane;_ we are _healthy_ in every part, but we are _sound_ in that which is essential for life; he who is _sound_ may live, but he who is _healthy_ enjoys life. _Sound_, in the sense of noise, comes from Latin _sonus_, a sound; _tone_, from Latin _tonum_, Greek _τόνος_, a thing stretched, the string of a musical instrument, the sound made by the vibrating of the string.  
_Sound_ is that which issues from any body, so as to become audible; _tone_ is a species of _sound_ which is produced from particular bodies: a _sound_ may be accidental; we may hear the _sounds_ of waters or leaves, of animals or men: _tones_ are those particular _sounds_ or modulations of _sound_ which are made either to express a particular feeling or to produce harmony; a sheep will cry for its lost young in a _tone_ of distress; an organ is so formed as to send forth the most solemn _tones._

####space 
**SPACE, ROOM.**  
For the derivation of _space_ see _spacious_ under AMPLE. _Room_, Anglo-Saxon _rum_, meant originally a wide space, and is allied to Latin _rus_ (whence _rural_, etc.), meaning wide open country.  
These are both abstract terms, expressive of that portion of the universe which is supposed not to be occupied by any solid body: _space_ is a general term which includes within itself that which infinitely surpasses our comprehension; _room_ is a limited term which comprehends those portions of _space_ which are artificially formed: _space_ is either extended or bounded; _room_ is always a bounded _space:_ the _space_ between two objects is either natural, incidental, or designedly formed; the _room_ is that which is the fruit of design, to suit the convenience of persons: there is a sufficient _space_ between the heavenly bodies to admit of their moving without confusion; the value of a house essentially depends upon the quantity of _room_ which it affords: in a row of trees there must always be vacant _spaces_ between each tree; in a car there will be _room_ only for a given number of persons.  
_Space_ is taken only in the natural sense; _room_ is also employed in the moral application; in every person there is ample _room_ for amendment or improvement.

####speak 
**SPEAK, SAY, TELL.**  
_Speak_ and _say_ are Anglo-Saxon words whose meaning has not altered from the beginning — _speak_ being derived from later Anglo-Saxon _specan_, and _say_ from _secgan;_ compare German _sprechen_ and _sagen. Tell_, Anglo-Saxon _tellan_, is allied to Anglo-Saxon _talu_, a number, a narrative — modern English _tale._  
To _speak_ may simply consist in uttering an articulate sound; but to _say_ is to communicate some idea by means of words: a child begins to _speak_ the moment it opens its hps to utter any acknowledged sound; but it will be some time before it can _say_ anything: a person is said to _speak_ high or low, distinctly or indistinctly; but he _says_ that which is true or false, right or wrong: a dumb man cannot _speak;_ a fool cannot _say_ anything that is worth hearing: we _speak_ languages, we_ speak_ sense or nonsense, we _speak_ intelligibly or unintelligibly; but we _say_ what we think at the time.  
In an extended sense, _speak_ may refer as much to sense as to sound, but then it applies only to general cases, and _say_ to particular and passing circumstances of life: it is a great abuse of the gift of speech not to _speak_ the truth; it is very culpable in a person to _say_ that he will do a thing and not to do it.  
To _say_ and _tell_ are both the ordinary actions of men in their daily intercourse; but _say_ is very partial, it may comprehend single unconnected sentences or even single words: we may _say_ yes or no, but we _tell_ that which is connected and which forms more or less of a narrative. To _say_ is to communicate that which passes in our own minds, to express our ideas and feelings as they rise; to _tell_ is to communicate events or circumstances respecting ourselves or others: it is not good to let children _say_ foolish things for the sake of talking: it is still worse for them to be encouraged in _telling_ everything they hear: when every one is allowed to _say_ what he likes and what he thinks, there will commonly be more _speakers_ than hearers; those who accustom themselves to _tell_ long stories impose a burden upon others which is not repaid by the pleasure of their company.  
See also [utter](entry://utter)  
**SPEAK, TALK, CONVERSE, DISCOURSE.** — The idea of communicating with, or communicating to, another, by means of signs, is common in the signification of all these terms: to _speak_ is an indefinite term specifying no circumstance of the action; we may _speak_ only one word or many; but _talk_, which is but a variation of _tell_, is a mode of _speaking_, namely, for a continuance: we may _speak_ from various motives; we _talk_ for pleasure; we _converse_ for improvement or intellectual gratification: we _speak_ with or to a person: we _talk_ commonly to others; we _converse_ with others. _Speaking_ a language is quite distinct from writing it: those who think least _talk_ most: _conversation is_ the rational employment of social beings, who seek by an interchange of ideas to purify the feelings and improve the understanding.  
_Conversation_ is the act of many together; _discourse_, in Latin _discursus_, expressing properly an examining or deliberating upon, like _talk_, may be the act of one addressing himself to others; parents and teachers _discourse_ with young people on moral duties. 

####special 
**SPECIAL, SPECIFIC, PARTICULAR.**  
_Special_, in Latin _specialis_, signifies belonging to the species; _specific_, in Latin _specificus_, from _speci-_, for _species_, a species, and a weakened form of _facere_, to make, signifies making a species; _particular_, belonging to a particle or small part. The _special_ is that which comes under the general; the _particular_ is that which comes under the _special:_ hence we speak of a _special_ rule; but a _particular_ case. _Particular_ and _specific_ are both applied to the properties of individuals; but _particular_ is said of the contingent circumstances of things, _specific_ of their inherent properties: every plant has something _particular_ in itself different from others, it is either longer or shorter, weaker or stronger; but its _specific_ property is that which it has in common with its species: _particular_ is, therefore, the term adapted to loose discourse; _specific_ is a scientific term which describes things minutely.  
The same may be said of _particularize_ and _specify:_ we _particularize_ for the sake of information; we _specify_ for the sake of instruction: in describing a man's person and dress we _particularize_ if we mention everything singly which can be said about it; in delineating a plan it is necessary to _specify_ time, place, distance, materials, and everything else which may be connected with the carrying it into execution.

####spellbound 
**SPELLBOUND, BEWITCHED.**  
These words have a similar meaning. Both are of Anglo-Saxon origin, and bear their original meaning on their face, as it were. _Spellbound_ means bound by a _spell_, a _spell_ being originally a narrative myth or fable, hence the absorption of one who listens to such narration; thence by extension an utterance or incantation, by which superhuman spirits were called upon to take the victim under their power. _Bewitched_ means under the influence of a witch. _Spellbound_ and _bewitched_ are both used figuratively — _spellbound_ to indicate a state of rapt attention in which all motion is suspended; _bewitched_ to signify under a powerful influence, which seems in some way abnormal. _Bewitched_ often describes absorbing and exclusive admiration of or devotion to a person or an idea. 

####spend 
**SPEND, EXHAUST, DRAIN.**  
_Spend_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _spendan_, to spend, shortened from Latin _dispendere_, from _dis_, out, and _pendere_, to weigh, meaning to weigh out money. _Exhaust_, from the Latin _ex_, out, and _haustus_, past participle of _haurire_, to draw water. _Drain_, in Anglo-Saxon _drenian_, originally meant to become _dry_, and is allied to _dry._  
The idea of taking from the substance of anything is common to these terms; but to _spend_ is to deprive it in a less degree than to _exhaust_, and that in a less degree than to _drain:_ every one who exerts himself in that degree _spends_ his strength; if the exertions are violent he _exhausts_ himself; a country which is _drained_ of men is supposed to have no more left. To _spend_ may be applied to that which is either external or inherent in a body; _exhaust_ to that which is inherent; _drain_ to that which is external of the body in which it is contained: we may speak of _spending_ our wealth, our resources, our time, and the like; but of _exhausting_ our strength, our vigor, our voice, and the like; of _draining_, in the proper application, a vessel of its liquid, or in the improper application, _draining_ a treasury of its contents: hence arises this further distinction, that to _spend_ and to _exhaust_ may tend, more or less, to the injury of a body; but to _drain_ may be to its advantage. Inasmuch as what is _spent_ or _exhausted_ may be more or less essential to the soundness of a body, it cannot be parted with without diminishing its value or even destroying its existence; as when a fortune is _spent_ it is gone, or when a person's strength is _exhausted_ he is no longer able to move: on the other hand, to _drain_, though a more complete evacuation, is not always injurious, but sometimes even useful to a body, as when the land is _drained_ of a superabundance of water.  
**SPEND, EXPEND, WASTE, DISSIPATE, SQUANDER.** — _Spend_ and _expend_ both come ultimately from Latin _pendere_, to weigh — _spend_ indirectly through Anglo-Saxon, _expend_ directly from Latin _ex_, out, and _pendere_, to weigh; but _spend_ implies simply to turn to some purpose or make use of; to _expend_ carries with it likewise the idea of exhausting; and _waste_, moreover, comprehends the idea of exhausting to no good purpose: we _spend_ money when we purchase anything with it; we expend it when we lay it out in large quantities so as essentially to diminish its quantity: individuals _spend_ what they have; government _expends_ vast sums in conducting the affairs of a nation; all persons _waste_ their property who have not sufficient discretion to use it well: we _spend_ our time, or our lives, in any employment; we _expend_ our strength and faculties upon some arduous undertaking; we _waste_ our time and talents in trifles.  
_Dissipate_, in Latin _dissipatus_, from _dissipare_, means to disperse, to throw in all directions. _Squander_ meant originally to scatter abroad, and is a nasalized form allied to Lowland Scotch _squatter_, to splash about, scatter. Both these terms, therefore, denote modes of _wasting;_ but the former seems peculiarly applicable to that which is _wasted_ in detail upon different objects, and by a distraction of the mind; the latter respects rather the act of _wasting_ in the gross, in large quantities, by planless profusion: young men are apt to _dissipate_ their property in pleasure; the open, generous, and thoughtless are apt to _squander_ their property.

####spirituous 
**SPIRITUOUS, SPIRITED, SPIRITUAL, GHOSTLY.**  
_Spirituous_ signifies having _spirit_ as a physical property, after the manner of _spirituous_ liquors: _spirited_ is applicable to the animal _spirits_ of either men or brutes; a person or a horse may be _spirited._  
What is _spiritual_ is after the manner of a _spirit_, and what is _ghostly_ is like a _ghost:_ although originally the same in meaning, the former being derived from the Latin _spiritus_, and the latter from the Anglo-Saxon _gast_, German _geist_, and both signifying what is not corporeal, yet they have acquired a difference of application. _Spiritual_ objects are mostly distinguished from those of sense. Hence it is that the _spiritual_ is opposed to the temporal.  
_Ghostly_ is more immediately opposed to the carnal or the secular, and is a term, therefore, of more solemn import.

####spread 
**SPREAD, SCATTER, DISPERSE.**  
_Spread_ applies equally to divisible or indivisible bodies; we _spread_ our money on the table, or we may _spread_ a cloth on the table; but _scatter_, like _shatter_, is a frequentative of _shake_, and is applicable to divisible bodies only; we _scatter_ corn on the ground. To _spread_ may be an act of design or otherwise, but mostly the former; as when we _spread_ books or papers before us: _scatter_ is mostly an act without design; a child _scatters_ the papers on the floor. When taken, however, as an act of design, it is done without order; but _spread_ is an act done in order; thus hay is _spread_ out to dry, but corn is _scattered_ over the land.  
Things may _spread_ in one direction, or at least without separation; but they _disperse_ (see [dispel](entry://dispel)) in many directions, so as to destroy the continuity of bodies: a leaf _spreads_ as it opens in all its parts, and a tree also _spreads_ as its branches increase; but a multitude _disperses_, an army _disperses._ Between _scatter_ and _disperse_ there is no other difference than that one is immethodical and often involuntary, the other systematic and intentional: flowers are _scattered_ along a path which accidentally fall from the hand; a mob is _dispersed_ by an act of authority: sheep are _scattered_ along the hills; religious tracts are _dispersed_ among the poor: the disciples were _scattered_ as sheep without a shepherd after the delivery of our Saviour into the hands of the Jews; they _dispersed_ themselves, after his ascension, over every part of the world.  
To _spread_ is the general, the other two are particular terms. To _spread_ may be said of anything which occupies more space than before, whether by a direct separation of its parts or by an accession to the substance; but to _expand_, from Latin _expandere_, is to _spread_ by means of extending or unfolding the parts; a mist _spreads_ over the earth; a flower _expands_ its leaves: a tree _spreads_ by the growth of its branches; the opening bud _expands_ when it feels the genial warmth of the sun. _Diffusion_ is that process of _spreading_ which consists literally in pouring out in different ways.  
_Spread_ and _expand_ are used likewise in a moral application; _diffuse_ is seldom used in any other application: _spread is_ here, as before, equally indefinite as to the mode of the action; everything _spreads_, and it _spreads_ in any way; but _expansion_ is that gradual process by which an object opens or unfolds itself after the manner of a flower. Evils _spread_, and reports _spread;_ the mind _expands_, and prospects _expand;_ knowledge _diffuses_ itself, or cheerfulness is _diffused_ throughout a company.  
**SPREAD, CIRCULATE, PROPAGATE, DISSEMINATE.** — To _spread_ is said of any object material or spiritual; the rest are mostly employed in the moral application. To _spread_ is to extend to an indefinite width; to _circulate_ is to spread within a circle: thus news _spreads_ through a country; but a story _circulates_ in a village or from house to house, or a report is _circulated_ in a neighborhood.  
_Spread_ and _circulate_ are the acts of persons or things; _propagate_ and _disseminate_ are the acts of persons only. The thing _spreads_ and _circulates_, or it is _spread_ and _circulated_ by some one; it is always _propagated_ and _disseminated_ by some one. _Propagate_, from the Latin _propagare_, to increase by layers, from _propages_, a layer, from stem contained in _compages_ (compare English _compact)_, a fastening together, and _disseminate_, from _dis_, apart, and _semen_, a seed, are here figuratively employed as modes of _spreading_, according to the natural operations of increasing the quantity of anything which is implied in the first two terms. What is _propagated_ is supposed to secure new adherents, as when doctrines, either good or bad, are _propagated_ among the people so as to make them converts: what is _disseminated_ is supposed to be sown in different parts; thus principles are _disseminated_ among youth. 

####sprightly

####spring 
**SPRING, FOUNTAIN, SOURCE.**  
_Spring_ denotes that which _springs;_ the word, therefore, carries us back to the point from which the water issues. _Fountain_, through French from Low Latin _fontana_, based on classical _fons_, a fountain, signifies that from which anything is poured, and comprehends in it a collection or certain quantity of water, both natural and artificial: and _source_ is from Old French _sorse_, the feminine past participle of the verb _sourdre_ (with intercalated _d)_, from _surgere_, to rise, and carries us back to the place whence the water takes its rise. _Springs_ are to be found by digging a sufficient depth in all parts of the earth: in mountainous countries, and also in the East, we read of _fountains_ which form themselves, and supply the surrounding parts with refreshing streams: the _sources_ of rivers are mostly to be traced to some mountain. These terms are all used in a figurative sense: _spring_ is taken for that which is always flowing; _fountain_ for that which contains an abundant supply for a stream, and _source_ for the channel through which from the commencement any event comes to pass.  
**SPRING, START, STARTLE, SHRINK.** — The idea of a sudden motion is expressed by all these terms, but the circumstances and mode differ in all; _spring_ is indefinite in these respects, and is therefore the most general term. To _spring_ and _start_, Middle English _sterten_, to move suddenly, may be either voluntary or involuntary movements, but the former is mostly voluntary and the latter involuntary; a person _springs_ out of bed, or one animal _springs_ upon another; a person or animal _starts_ from a certain point to begin running, or _starts_ with fright from one side to the other. To _startle_, which is a frequentative of _start_, is always an involuntary action; a horse _starts_ by suddenly flying from the point on which he stands; but if he _startles_ he seems to fly back on himself and stops his course; to _spring_ and _start_, therefore, always carry a person farther from a given point; but _startle_ and _shrink_ are movements within one's self; _startling_ is a sudden convulsion of the frame which makes a person stand in hesitation whether to proceed or not; _shrinking_, from Anglo-Saxon _scrincan_, is allied to _shrug, shrimp_, etc., and means a contraction of the frame within itself; any sudden and unexpected sound makes a person _startle;_ the approach of any frightful object makes him _shrink_ back; _spring_ and _start_ are mostly employed only in the proper sense of corporeal movements; _startle_ and _shrink_ are employed in regard to the movements of the mind as well as the body. See also [arise](entry://arise)  
**SPRINKLE, BEDEW.** — _Sprinkle_ is from _sprenkle_, the frequentative form of Middle English _sprengen_, allied to  
Dutch _sprenkelen, to_ sprinkle; it denotes either an act of nature or design: to _bedew_ is to cover with _dew_, which is an operation of nature. By _sprinkling_, a liquid falls in visible drops upon the earth; by _bedewing_, it covers by imperceptible drops: rain _besprinkles_ the earth; dew _bedews_ it.  
So likewise, figuratively, things are _sprinkled_ with flour; the cheeks are _bedewed_ with tears.

####sprout 
**SPROUT, BUD.**  
_Sprout_ is in Anglo-Saxon _sprutan_, meaning to germinate, allied to _spout. Bud_ is a word of uncertain but probably Teutonic origin which does not appear in Anglo-Saxon, but is found in Middle English as _bud-den, to bud._ Cf. Dutch _bot_, a bud. To _bud_ is to put forth _buds;_ the noun _bud_ is a variation from button, which it resembles in form. (Cf. the French _bouton_, which means both _bud_ and button.) To _sprout_ is to come forth from the stem; to _bud_, to put forth in _buds._

####spurious 
**SPURIOUS, SUPPOSITITIOUS, COUNTERFEIT.**  
Spurious comes from Latin _spuries_, false, of illegitimate birth. _Supposititious_ is derived from Latin _suppositicius_, from the stem of _supponere_, suppose or substitute, and signifies to be supposed or conjectured, something not real but substituted, in distinction from being positively known. _Counterfeit_ (see [imitate](entry://imitate)).  
All these terms are modes of the false; the former two indirectly, the latter directly; whatever is uncertain that might be certain, and whatever is conjectured that might be conclusive, are by implication false; that which is made in imitation of another thing, so as to pass for it as the true one, is positively false. Hence, the distinction between these terms and the ground of their applications. An illegitimate offspring is said to be _spurious_ in the literal sense of the word, the father in this case being always uncertain; and any offspring which is termed _spurious_ falls necessarily under the imputation of not being the offspring of the person whose name it bears. In the same manner an edition of a work is termed _spurious_ which comes out under a false name or a name different from that on the title page; _supposititious_ expresses more or less of falsehood, according to the nature of the thing. A _supposititious_ parent implies little less than a directly false parent; but in speaking of the origin of any person in remote periods of antiquity, it may be merely _supposititious_ or conjectural from the want of information. _Counterfeit_ respects rather works of art which are exposed to imitation: coin is _counterfeit_ which bears a false stamp, and every invention which comes out under the sanction of the inventor's name is likewise a _counterfeit_ if not made by himself or by his consent. 

####spurt 
**SPURT, SPOUT.**  
To _spurt_ meant originally to germinate and is the same word as _sprout;_ Middle English _spruten. Spout._ Middle English _spouten_, to spurt out — the word has probably no relation to the English _spit;_ they both express the idea of sending forth liquid in small quantities from a cavity; the former, however, does not always include the idea of the cavity, but simply that of springing up; the latter is, however, confined to the circumstances of issuing forth from some place; dirt may be _spurted_ in the face by means of kicking it up, or blood may be _spurted_ out of a vein when it is opened, water out of the mouth, and the like; but a liquid _spouts_ out from a pipe. To _spurt_ is a sudden action arising from a momentary impetus given to a liquid either intentionally or incidentally; the beer will _spurt_ from a barrel when the vent-peg is removed: to _spout_ is a continued action produced by a perpetual impetus which the liquid receives equally from design or accident; the water _spouts_ out from a pipe which is denominated a _spout_, or it will _spout_ out from any cavity in the earth, or in a rock which may resemble a _spout;_ a person may likewise _spout_ water in a stream from his mouth.  
Hence the figurative application of these terms; any sudden conceit which compels a person to an eccentric action is a _spurt_, particularly if it springs from ill-humor or caprice; a woman will sometimes take a _spurt_ and treat her intimate friends very coldly, either from a fancied offence or a fancied superiority; to _spout_, on the other hand, is to send forth a stream of words in imitation of the stream of liquid, and is applied to those who affect to be speakers or who recite in an affected manner. 

####spy 
**SPY, SCOUT.**  
For the derivation of _spy_ see [emissary](entry://emissary). _Scout_ is derived from Old French _escouter_, to listen, Latin _auscultare._ A _spy_ and a _scout_ are both agents sent out to gain information, but _spy_ suggests secrecy and disguise; _scout_ active and watchful movement. A _spy_, in times of war, enters directly into the camp of the enemy and gains what information he can by pretending to espouse the enemy's cause. A _scout_, on the other hand, is a kind of watchman, as it were, sent out to explore a territory and find out what he can without being caught. He depends upon quickness of movement, skill, and observation rather than upon deceit. 

####squalid 
**SQUALID, DIRTY, FOUL.**  
_Squalid, dirty_, and _foul_ all indicate a condition of uncleanness. _Dirty_ signifies merely that which is not clean, that which is covered with dirt. _Foul_, Anglo-Saxon _ful_, adds to the idea of uncleanness the suggestion of something loathsome, offensive. _Squalid_, from Latin _squalidus_, adds to the idea of uncleanness the suggestion of misery and poverty. A palace may be _dirty_ or _foul;_ but it will not be _squalid._ A peasant's hut may be spoken of as _squalid._

####staff 
**STAFF, STAY, PROP, SUPPORT.**  
From _staff_ in the literal sense comes _staff_ in the figurative application: anything may be denominated a _staff_ which holds up after the manner of a _staff_, particularly as it respects persons; bread is said to be the _staff_ of life; one person may serve as a _staff_ to another.  
The _staff_ serves in a state of motion; the _slay_ and _prop_ are employed for objects in a state of rest: the _stay_ makes a thing _stay_ for the time being, it keeps it in its place; it is equally applied to persons and things: we may be a _stay_ to a person who is falling by letting his body rest against us; in the same manner buttresses against a wall, and shores against a building, serve the purpose of _stays_ while they are repairing. For the same reason that part of a woman's dress which serves as a _stay_ to the body is denominated _stays:_ the _prop_ keeps a thing up as a permanency; every pillar on which a building rests is a _prop;_ whatever, therefore, requires to be raised from the ground and kept in that state may be set upon _props. Support_ (see [hold](entry://hold)) is a general term, and in its most general sense comprehends all the others as species: whatever _supports_, that is, bears the weight of an object, is a _support_, whether in a state of motion like a _staff_ or in a state of rest like a _stay_ or _prop. Staff, stay_, and _prop_ are applied figuratively in the sense of a _support_, with a similar distinction between them.  
_Support_, is applied in the proper sense to moral as well as tangible objects: hope is the _support_ of the mind under the most trying circumstances; religion, as the foundation of all our hopes, is the best and surest _support_ under affliction.  
**STAFF, STICK, CRUTCH.** — _Staff_ is in Anglo-Saxon _stœf. Stick_ is Anglo-Saxon _sticca_, something that could _stick_ or pierce into another object. _Crutch_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _cricc_, developing to _crick_ (cf. _cricket)_, and through _critch_ to _crutch_, a bent stick, and hence a _crutch_ or _staff._  
The ruling idea in a _staff_ is that of firmness and fixedness; it is employed for leaning upon; the ruling idea in the _stick_ is that of sharpness with which it can penetrate; it is used for walking and ordinary purposes: the ruling idea in the _crutch_ is its form, which serves the specific purpose of support in case of lameness; a _staff_ can never be small, but a _stick_ may be large; a _crutch_ is in size more of a _staff_ than a common _stick._

####stagger 
**STAGGER, REEL, TOTTER.**  
_Stagger is_ a Scandinavian word from a root signifying to push allied to _stake._ To _reel_ signifies to go around like a _reel_, a small spindle for winding yarn. _Totter_ is for _toiler_, a frequentative of _tilt._  
All these terms designate an involuntary and an unsteady motion; they vary both in the cause and the mode of the action; _staggering_ and _reeling_ are occasioned either by drunkenness or sickness; _tottering_ is purely the effect of weakness, particularly the weakness of old age: a drunken man always _staggers_ as he walks; one who is giddy _reels_ from one part to another: to _stagger_ is a much less degree of unsteadiness than to _reel;_ for he who _staggers_ is only thrown a little out of the straight path, but he who _reels_ altogether loses his equilibrium; _reeling_ is commonly succeeded by falling. To _stagger_ and _reel_ are said as to the carriage of the whole body; but _totter_ has particular reference to the limbs; the knees and the legs _totter_, and consequently the footsteps become _tottering._ In an extended application, the mountains may be said to _stagger_ and to _reel_ in an earthquake: the houses may _totter_ from their very bases. In a figurative application, the faith or the resolution of a person _staggers_ when its hold on the mind is shaken and begins to give way; a nation or a government will _totter_ when it is torn by internal convulsions. 

####stagnate 
See [stand](entry://stand)

####stain 
**STAIN, SOIL, SULLY, TARNISH.**  
_Stain_ (see [blemish](entry://blemish)). _Soil_ comes through French from Latin _suillus_, a pig; from _sus_, a sow, and signifies to wallow as a sow. _Sully_, Anglo-Saxon _sylian_, means to bemire, from Teutonic _sol_, mud, Modern English _soil;_ but its meaning may be influenced by the verb to _soil. Tarnish_ comes through French from Old High German _tarnen_, to obscure, darken.  
All these terms imply the act of diminishing the brightness of an object; but the term _stain_ denotes something grosser than the other terms and is applied to inferior objects: things which are not remarkable for purity or brightness may bo _stained._ as hands when _stained_ with blood or a wall _stained_ with chalk; nothing is _sullied_ or _tarnished_ but what has some intrinsic value; a fine picture or piece of writing may be easily _soiled_ by a touch of the finger; the finest glass is the soonest _tarnished:_ hence, in the moral application, a man's life may be _stained_ by some gross immorality: his honor may be _sullied_ or his glory _tarnished._

####stalwart 
**STALWART, ATHLETIC, BRAWNY.**  
_Stalwart_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _stœpol-wyrde_, literally, foundation-worthy, capable of being used as a foundation, hence strong, steadfast. _Athletic_, from Greek _αθλητής_, one who contends for a prize, means characteristic of one trained for physical contests. _Brawny_ means having brawn, from Old French _braon_, a slice of flesh, German _braton_, flesh for roasting, brawn referring especially to the fleshy, muscular portions of the arms or legs. All these words signify "in possession of physical strength. " In the case of _stalwart_ the idea of physical endurance and courage is added to that of strength; in the case of _athletic_ the idea of a special training rendering the body flexible and self-controlled as well as strong is added; in the case of _brawny_ the specific suggestion of large muscles and hardened flesh is added to the idea common to all three words.

####stand 
**STAND, STOP, REST, STAGNATE.**  
To _stand_, in Middle English _standen_, cognate with German _stehen_, Russian _stat'_ or _stayat'_, Latin _stare_, Greek _ίστημι_, to stand, Hebrew _sut_, to settle. _Stop_, in Saxon _stoppan_, etc., conveys the ideas of pressing, thickening, as in the Low Latin _stupare_, to stop up with food, from the classical _stupa_, meaning _tow_, and the Greek _στύπη_, whence it has been made in English to express immovability. _Rest_ (see [ease](entry://ease)). _Stagnate_, in Latin _stagnatus_, participle of _stagnare_, comes from _stagnum_, a pool, and that either from _stare_, to stand, because waters _stand_ perpetually in a pool, or from the Greek _στεγνός_, an enclosure, because a pool is an enclosure for waters.  
The absence of motion is expressed by all these terms; stand is the most general of all the terms; to _stand_ is simply not to move; to _stop_ is to cease to move: we _stand_ either for want or inclination or power to move; but we _stop_ from a disinclination to go on: to _rest_ is to _stop_ from an express dislike to motion; we may _stop_ for purposes of convenience or because we have no farther to go, but we rest from fatigue.  
To _stagnate_ is only a species of _standing_ as respects liquids; water may both _stand_ and _stagnate:_ but the former is a temporary, the latter a permanent, _stand:_ water _stands_ in a puddle, but it _stagnates_ in a pond or in any confined space.  
All these terms admit of an extended application; business _stands_ still, or there is a _stand_ to business; a mercantile house _stops_, or _stops_ payment; an affair _rests_ undecided, or _rests_ in the hands of a person; trade _stagnates._

####state 
**STATE, REALM, COMMONWEALTH.**  
The _state_ is that consolidated part of a nation in which lie its power and greatness. The _realm_, from Old French _realme_, Modern _royaume_, a kingdom, both based on a hypothetical Low Latin _regalimen_, is any state whose government is monarchial. The _commonwealth_ is the grand body of a nation, consisting both of the government and people, which forms the _commonwealth, welfare_, or _wealth._  
The ruling idea in the sense and application of the word _state_ is that of government in its most abstract sense; affairs of _state_ may either concern the internal regulations of a country or the arrangements of different _states_ with each other. The term _realm_ is employed for the nation at large, but confined to such nations as are monarchial and aristocratical; peers of the _realm_ sit in the English Parliament by their own right. The term _commonwealth_ refers rather to the aggregate body of men and their possessions than to the government of a country: it is the business of the minister to consult the interests of the _commonwealth._  
Its political components constitute the _commonwealth_ of Australia, and its counties the _commonwealth_ of Massachusetts.

####stick 
**STICK, CLEAVE, ADHERE.**  
_Stick_ is in Anglo-Saxon _stecan_, Low German _steken_, Latin _stigare_, Greek _στίζειν_, to prick, Hebrew _stock, to_ press. _Cleave_, in Anglo-Saxon _cleofian_, Low German _kliven_ Danish _klaebe_, is connected with our words _glue_ and _lime_, in Latin _gluten_, Greek _κόλλα_, glue. _Adhere_ (see [attach](entry://attach)).  
These terms all express the being joined to a body so as not to part from it without an effort. _Stick_, which is the general and familiar expression, denotes a junction more or less close: things may _stick_ very slightly, so as to come off with the smallest touch, or things may be made to _stick_ together so fast that they cannot be separated; wet paper may _stick_ for a time, and by means of glue may _stick_ firmly.  
What _sticks_ may _stick_ in any manner, but what _adheres_, when said of natural bodies, _adheres_ by the _sticking_ on the outer surface: a foot _sticks_ in the mud: wax _adheres to_ the fingers. _Adhesion_, denoting a property of matter, is a scientific term.  
_Cleave_ is seldomer used than either of the other terms, but always implies a close _adhesion_ produced by some particular cause.  
_Stick_ and _adhere_ may also be applied figuratively, with the like distinction.  
As the act of conscious agents, _stick_ is, as before, the familiar expression, whether applied to material or spiritual objects; a person may _stick_ with his body or his mind to anything: in both cases it is an act of determination or perseverance.  
A person _cleaves_ or _adheres to_ an object, in the former case out of feeling, in the latter case from principle: a drowning man will _cleave to_ anything by which he can be saved; a conscientious man _adheres to_ the truth.

####stifle 
**STIFLE, SUPPRESS, SMOTHER.**  
_Stifle_ is a Scandinavian word, allied to Icelandic _stifla, to_ dam up, make stiff, and to English _stiff. Suppress_ (see [repress](entry://repress)). _Smother_ comes from Middle English _smorther_, a suffocating smoke, and means to have the effect of a suffocating smoke.  
_Stifle_ and _smother_ in their literal sense will be more properly considered under the article on SUFFOCATE; they are here taken in a moral application. The leading idea in all these terms is that of keeping out of view: _stifle_ is applicable to the feelings only; _suppress to_ the feelings or to outward circumstances; _smother_ to outward circumstances only: we _stifle_ resentment; we _suppress_ anger: the former is an act of some continuance; the latter is the act of the moment: we _stifle_ our resentment by abstaining to take any measures of retaliation; we _suppress_ the rising emotion of anger, so as not to give it utterance or even the expression of a look. It requires time and powerful motives to _stifle_, but only a single effort to _suppress;_ nothing but a long course of vice can enable a man to _stifle_ the admonitions and reproaches of conscience; a sense of prudence may sometimes lead a man to _suppress_ the joy which an occurrence produces in his mind. In regard to outward circumstances, we say that a book is _suppressed_ by the authority of government; that vice is _suppressed_ by the exertions of those who have power: an affair is _smothered_ so that it shall not become generally known, or the fire is _smothered_ under the embers.

####stir 
**STIR, MOVE.**  
_Stir_ is in Anglo-Saxon _styrian_, to move. _Move_ (see [motion](entry://motion)).  
_Stir_ is here a specific, _move_ a generic, term: we may _move_ in any manner, but to _stir_ is to _move_ so as to disturb the rest and composure either of the body or mind; the term _stir_ is therefore mostly employed in cases where any motion, however small, is a disturbance: a soldier must not _stir_ from the post which he has to defend; atrocious criminals or persons raving mad are bound hand and foot, that they may not _stir._

####stir up 
See [awaken](entry://awaken)

####stock 
**STOCK, STORE.**  
_Stock_ meant originally a stump remaining in the ground — a significance which it still retains: hence it developed the meaning of something fixed. The ideas of wealth and stability being naturally allied, it is not surprising that _stock_, which expresses the latter idea, should also be put for the former, particularly as the abundance here referred to serves as a foundation, in the same manner as _stock_ in the literal sense does to a tree. _Store_ likewise implies a quantity; but it implies an accumulated quantity. Any quantity of materials which is in hand may serve as a _stock_ for a given purpose; thus a few shillings with some persons may be their _stock_-in-trade: any quantity of materials brought together for a given purpose may serve as a _store;_ thus the industrious ant collects a _store_ of grain for the winter. The _stock_ is that which must increase of itself; it is the source and foundation of industry; the store is that which we must add to occasionally; it is that from which we draw in time of need. By a _stock_ we gain riches; by a _store_ we guard against want.  
The same distinction exists between these words in their moral application; he who wishes to speak a foreign language must have a _stock_ of familiar words; _stores_ of learning are frequently lost to the world for want of means and opportunity to bring them forth to public view.  
As verbs, to stock and to _store_ both signify to provide; but the former is a provision for the present use and the latter for some future purpose: a tradesman _stocks_ himself with such articles as are most salable; a fortress or a ship is _stored:_ a person _stocks_ himself with patience or _stores_ his memory with knowledge.

####story 
**STORY, TALE.**  
The _story_ (see [anecdote](entry://anecdote)) is either an actual fact or something feigned; the _tale_ (see [fable](entry://fable)) is always feigned: _stories_ are circulated respecting the accidents and occurrences which happen to persons in the same place; _tales_ of distress are told by many merely to excite compassion. When both are taken for that which is fictitious, the _story_ is either an untruth or falsifying of some fact or it is altogether an invention; the _tale_ is always an invention. As an untruth, the _story_ is commonly told by children; and as a fiction, the _story_ is commonly made for children: the _tale_ is of deeper invention, formed by men of mature understanding, and adapted for persons of mature years. 

####stout 
See **corpulent** under [corporal](entry://corporal)

####straight 
**STRAIGHT, RIGHT, DIRECT.**  
_Straight_ is the Middle English past participle of the verb which is now _stretch_, and meant literally _stretched. Straight_ is applied, therefore, in its proper sense, to corporeal objects; a path which is _straight_ is kept within a shorter space than if it were curved. _Right_ and _direct_, from the _rectus_, the past participle of Latin _regere_ (to rule, guide), meaning here regulated or made as it ought, are said of that which is made by the force of the understanding, or by an actual effort, what one wishes it to be: hence, the mathematician speaks of a _right_ line, as the line which lies most justly between two points, and has been made the basis of mathematical figures; and the moralist speaks of the _right_ opinion, as that which has been formed by the best rule of the understanding; and, on the same ground, we speak of a _direct_ answer as that which has been framed so as to bring one soonest and easiest to the point desired. 

####strain 
**STRAIN, SPRAIN, STRESS, FORCE.**  
_Strain_ is derived through Old French _estraindre_, from Latin _stringere_, to pull tight, related to Anglo-Saxon _streccan_, to stretch: _sprain_ comes from Old French _espreindre_, to press or wring, from Latin _exprimere_, to press out. To _strain_ is to extend beyond its ordinary length by some extraordinary effort; to _sprain_ is to _strain_ so as to put out of its place or extend to an injurious length: the ankle and the wrist are liable to be _sprained_ by a sudden wrenching; the back and other parts of the body may be _strained_ by overexertion.  
_Strain_ and _stress_ are kindred terms, as being both variations of stretch and _stringere;_ but they differ now very considerably in their application: figuratively we speak of _straining_ a nerve, or _straining_ a point, to express making great exertions, even beyond our ordinary powers; and morally we speak of laying a _stress_ upon any particular measure or mode of action, signifying to give a thing importance: the _strain_ (see [stress](entry://stress)) may be put for the course of sentiment which we express and the manner of expressing it; the _stress_ may be put for the efforts of the voice in uttering a word or syllable: a writer may proceed in a _strain_ of panegyric or invective; a speaker or a reader lays a _stress_ on certain words by way of distinguishing them from others. To _strain_ is properly a species of _forcing;_ we may _force_ in a variety of ways, that is, by the exercise of _force_ upon different bodies and in different directions; but to _strain_ is to exercise _force_ by stretching or prolonging bodies; thus to _strain_ a cord is to pull it to its full extent; but we may speak of _forcing_ any hard substance in, or _forcing_ it out, or _forcing_ it through, or _forcing_ it from a body: a door or a lock may be _forced_ by violently breaking it; but a door or a lock may be _strained_ by putting the hinges or the spring out of their place. So, likewise, a person may be said to _force_ himself to speak when by a violent exertion he gives utterance to his words; but he _strains_ his throat or his voice when he exercises the _force_ on the throat or lungs so as to extend them. _Force_ and _stress_, as nouns, are in like manner comparable when they are applied to the mode of utterance; we must use a certain _force_ in the pronunciation of every word; this, therefore, is indefinite and general; but the _stress_ is that particular and strong degree of _force_ which is exerted in the pronunciation of certain words. 

####strait 
**STRAIT, NARROW.**  
_Strait_ is derived through French from Latin _strictus_, participle of _stringere_, to bind close, and signifies bound tight, that is, brought into a small compass: _narrow_, from Anglo-Saxon _nearu_, closely drawn, expresses a mode of nearness or closeness. _Strait_ is a particular term; _narrow_ is general: _straitness_ is an artificial mode of _narrowness;_ a coat is _strait_ which is made to compress a body within a small compass: _narrow_ is either the artificial or the natural property of a body, as a _narrow_ ribbon or a _narrow_ leaf. That which is _strait_ is so by the means of other bodies, as a piece of water confined close on each side by land is called a _strait:_ whatever is bounded by sides that are near each other is _narrow;_ thus a piece of land whose prolonged sides are at a small distance from each other is _narrow._ The same distinction applies to these terms in their moral or extended use. 

####strange 
See [particular](entry://particular)

####stranger 
**STRANGER, FOREIGNER, ALIEN.**  
_Stranger_, in Old French _estrangier_, from Latin _extraneus_, based on the preposition _extra_, in Greek _έξ_, signifies out of, that is, out of another country: _foreigner_, from Old French _forain_, derived from Low Latin _foranens_, from classical _foras_, out of doors, and _alien_, from _alienus_, another's, have obviously the same original meaning: they have, however, deviated in their acceptations.  
_Stranger_ is a general term and applies to one not known or not an inhabitant, whether of the same or another country; _foreigner_ is applied only to _strangers_ of another country, and _alien_ to one who has no political or natural tie. Ulysses, after his return from the Trojan war, was a _stranger_ in his own house; the French are _foreigners_ in England, and the English in France; neither can enjoy, as _aliens_, the same privileges in a _foreign_ country as they do in their own: the laws of hospitality require us to treat _strangers_ with more ceremony than we do members of the same family or very intimate friends: the lower orders of the English are apt to treat _foreigners_ with an undeserved contempt; every _alien_ is obliged, in time of war, to have a license for residing in a foreign country.  
_Stranger_ is sometimes taken for one not acquainted with an object or not experienced in its effects: _foreigner_ is used only in the proper sense; but the epithet _foreign_ sometimes signifies not belonging to an object: _alien_ is applied in its natural sense to that which is unconnected by any tie.

####stream 
**STREAM, CURRENT, TIDE.**  
A fluid body in a progressive motion is the object described in common by these terms: _stream_ is the most general, the other two are but modes of the _stream: stream_, in Anglo-Saxon _stream_, in German _strom_, comes from a root meaning to flow; a _current_, from _currere_, to run, is a _stream_ running in a particular direction; and a _tide_, Anglo-Saxon _tid_, time, in German _zeit_, time, is a periodical _stream_ or _current._ All rivers are _streams_, which are more or less gentle according to the nature of the ground through which they pass; the force of the _current_ is very much increased by the confinement of any water, between rocks, or by means of artificial impediments: the _tide_ is high or low, strong or weak, at different hours of the day; when the _tide_ is high, the _current_ is strongest.  
From knowing the proper application of these terms, their figurative and moral application becomes obvious: a _stream_ of air or a _stream_ of light is a prolonged moving body of air or light: so a _stream_ of charity, bounty, and the like is that which flows in a stream: a _current_ of air is a particular _stream_ of air passing through or between other bodies, as the _current_ of air in a house; so the _current_ of men's minds or opinions, that is, the running in a particular line: the _tide_ being a temporary _stream;_ fashion, or the ruling propensity of the day, may be denominated a _tide:_ it is sometimes vain to attempt to stem the _tide_ of folly, it is therefore wiser to get out of its reach.

####strength

####strengthen 
**STRENGTHEN, FORTIFY, INVIGORATE.**  
_Strengthen_, from _strength_, and _fortify_, from _fortis_ and a weakened form of _facere_, signify to make strong: _invigorate_ signifies to put in vigor (see [energy](entry://energy)).  
Whatever adds to the _strength_, be it in ever so small a degree, _strengthens;_ exercise _strengthens_ either body or mind; whatever gives _strength_ for a particular emergency _fortifies;_ religion _fortifies_ the mind against adversity: whatever adds to the _strength_, so as to give a positive degree of _strength, invigorates;_ morning exercise in fine weather _invigorates._

####strenuous 
**STRENUOUS, BOLD.**  
_Strenuous_, in Latin _strenuus_, from the Greek _στρηνής_, strong, undaunted, untamed, expresses much more than _bold; boldness_ is a prominent idea, but it is only one idea which enters into the signification of _strenuousness;_ this combines likewise fearlessness, activity, and ardor. An advocate in a cause may be _strenuous_ or merely _bold:_ in the former case he omits nothing that can be either said or done in favor of the cause, he is always on the alert, he heeds no difficulties or danger; but in the latter case he displays his spirit only in the undisguised declaration of his sentiments. _Strenuous_ supporters of any opinion are always strongly convinced of the truth of that which they support, and deeply impressed with a sense of its importance; but the _bold_ supporter of an opinion may be impelled rather by the desire of showing his _boldness_ than maintaining his point. 

####stress 
**STRESS, STRAIN, EMPHASIS, ACCENT.**  
_Stress_ and _strain_ (for both see [strain](entry://strain)) are general both in sense and application; the former (from Old French _estrecir_, based on a hypothetical derivative of Latin _strictus_, tightened) still more than the latter: _emphasis_, from the Greek _ΐμφασις_, composed of _έv_, in, and _φάσις_, an appearance, signifying making to appear, and _accent_, in Latin _accentus_, from _ad_, to, and _cantus_, a song, signifying to suit the tune or tone of the voice, are modes of the _stress. Stress_ is applicable to all bodies the powers of which may be tried by exertion, as the _stress_ upon a rope, upon a shaft of a carriage, a wheel or spring in a machine: the _strain_ is an excessive _stress_, by which a thing is thrown out of its course; there may be a _strain_ in most cases where there is a _stress:_ but _stress_ and _strain_ are to be compared with _emphasis_ and _accent_, particularly in the exertion of the voice, in which case the _stress_ is a strong and special exertion of the voice on one word, or one part of a word, so as to distinguish it from another; but the _strain_ is the undue exertion of the voice beyond its usual pitch, in the utterance of one or more words: we lay a _stress_ for the convenience of others; but when we _strain_ the voice it is as much to the annoyance of others as it is hurtful to ourselves. The _stress_ may consist in an elevation of voice or a prolonged utterance; the _emphasis_ is that species of _stress_ which is employed to distinguish one word or syllable from another: the _stress_ may be accidental; but the _emphasis_ is an intentional _stress:_ ignorant people and children are often led to lay the stress on small and unimportant words in a sentence; speakers sometimes find it convenient to mark particular words, to which they attach a value, by the _emphasis_ with which they utter them. The _stress_ may be casual or regular, on words or syllables; the _accent_ is that kind of regulated _stress_ which is laid on one syllable to distinguish it from another: there are many words in our own language, such as subject, object, present, and the like, where, to distinguish the verb from the noun, the _accent_ falls on the last syllable for the former and on the first syllable for the latter.  
In reference to the use of words, these terms may admit of a. further distinction; for we may lay a _stress_ or _emphasis_ on a particular point of our reasoning, in the first case, by enlarging upon it longer than on other points; or, in the second case, by the use of stronger expressions or epithets. The _strain_ or _accent_ may be employed to designate the tone or manner in which we express ourselves, that is, the spirit of our discourse: in familiar language, we talk of a person's proceeding in a _strain_ of panegyric or of censure; but, in poetry, persons are said to pour forth their complaints of love in tender _accents._

####stretch 
See [extend](entry://extend)

####strict 
**STRICT, SEVERE.**  
_Strict_, from _strictus_, bound or confined, characterizes the thing which binds or keeps in control: _severe_ (see [austere](entry://austere)) characterizes in the proper sense the disposition of the person to inflict pain, and in an extended application the thing which inflicts pain. The term _strict_ is, therefore, taken always in the good sense; _severe_ is good or bad, according to circumstances: he who has authority over others must be _strict_ in enforcing obedience, in keeping good order, and in requiring a proper attention to their duties; but it is possible to be very _severe_ in punishing those who are under us and yet very lax in all matters that our duty demands of us.  
_Strict_ may with propriety be applied to one's self as well as others: _severe_ is applied to one's self only to denote self-mortification. 

####stricture 
See [animadversion](entry://animadversion)

####strife 
**STRIFE, CONTENTION.**  
(_Strife_ and _contention_, derived from the verbs _strive_ and _contend_ (see [strive](entry://strive)), have this further distinction, that they are both taken in the bad sense for acts of anger or passion; in this case _strife_ is mostly used for verbal _strife_, where each party _strives_ against the other by the use of contemptuous or provoking expressions; _contention_ is used for an angry _striving_ with others, either in respect to matters of opinion or matters of claim, in which each party seeks to get the better of the other. _Strife_ is the result of a quarrelsome humor; _contention_, of a restless, selfish, and greedy humor: _strife_ is most commonly to be found in private life; _contention_ but too frequently mingles itself in all the affairs of men. See also [discord](entry://discord)

####strike 
**STRIKE, HIT, KNOCK, SMITE, RAP, CUFF, SLAP.**  
These words all signify to give a blow to something, but they differ in respect to the kind of blow indicated. _Strike_, from Anglo-Saxon _strican_, to go, proceed, allied to German _streichen_, to stroke, means to give a smooth, swift blow in which the length of something hits another thing. _Hit_, on the other hand, is a Scandinavian word meaning to light on — to touch quickly and sharply with a point of something. The arrow _hits_ the mark; the peasant _strikes_ his horse with a stick. These distinctions are not generally observed, but they are certainly implied in the use of the two words. To _knock_, Anglo-Saxon _cnucian_, is to strike one thing against another so as to make a sound; it implies the use of something hard and knobby. To _rap_, from Danish _rap_, is to knock lightly. To _smite_, from Anglo-Saxon _smitan_, meant originally to smear or to rub, and was a sarcastic expression for _strike._ It implies the use of the flat surface of something in delivering the blow. It is a slightly archaic word in English, with a Biblical flavor, and is the strongest and most energetic of these terms. It implies the overcoming of another with blows. To _slap_, perhaps an onomatopoeic word, is to strike with the flat surface of the hand. To _cuff_, from the Scandinavian, is to strike with the doubled fist, or perhaps with the palm of the hand, implying random, sidelong blows. The distinctions here suggested are not absolute distinctions carefully observed. The words are in many circumstances well-nigh interchangeable, and the meaning of one readily merges into another; but the differences mentioned seem to be implied in the general use of the several terms when they are used most carefully.

####strive 
**STRIVE, CONTEND, VIE.**  
_Strive_ comes through Old French _estriver_, from the Scandinavian. For _contend_ see [contend](entry://contend). _Vie_ is derived from Old French _envier_, Latin _invitare_, meaning to invite to a game, hence to contend in a game.  
To _strive_ is the act of individuals without regard to others; as when a person _strives_ to get a living or to improve himself; to _contend_ and _vie_ both denote the act of an individual in reference to others; as to _contend_ in a lawsuit, to _vie_ in dress. To _strive_ may sometimes be applied where there is more than one party, as to _strive_ for the mastery; but in this case the efforts of the individual are more distinctly considered than when we speak of _contending_ for a prize; for this reason these words may be applied in precisely the same connection, but still with this distinction.  
_Striving_ consists always of some active effort, as when persons _strive_ at the oar; _contending_ may proceed verbally, as when men _contend_ for their opinions; and _vying_ may be indicated by any expression of the wish to put one's self in a state of competition with another; as persons _vie_ with each other in the grandeur of their houses or equipages.  
_Contend_ may be used in a moral application, as to _contend_ with difficulties: and _vie_ may be used figuratively, as one flower may be said to _vie_ with another in the beauty of its colors.

####strong 
**STRONG, ROBUST, STURDY.**  
_Strong_ is in Anglo-Saxon _Strang_, answering to German _streng. Robust_, in Latin _robustus_, from _robur_, signifies, literally, having the strength of oak. _Sturdy_ comes through Middle English _sturdi_, from Old French _estourdi_, amazed, of unknown origin. It meant rash, hence the physical frame of one capable of an adventurous deed.  
_Strong_ is here the generic term; the others are specific, or specify strength under different circumstances; _robust_ is a positive and high degree of strength arising from a peculiar bodily make: a man may be _strong_ from the strength of his constitution, from the power which is inherent in his frame; but a _robust_ man has strength from both the size and texture of his body, in bone and nerve he is endowed with great power. A little man may be _strong_, although not _robust;_ a tall, stout man, in full health, may be termed _robust._ A man may be _strong_ in one part of his body and not in another; he may be _stronger_ at one time, from particular circumstances, than he is at another: but a _robust_ man is _strong_ in his whole body; and, as he is _robust_ by nature, he will cease to be so only from disease.  
_Sturdiness_ lies both in the make of the body and the temper of the mind: a _sturdy_ man is capable of making resistance, and ready to make it; he must be naturally _strong_, and not of slender make, but he need not be _robust:_ a _sturdy_ peasant presents us with a man who, both by nature and habit, is formed for withstanding the inroads of an enemy.  
Things as well as persons may be said to be _strong_, as opposed to the weak; as a _strong_ rope, a _strong_ staff: _robust_ and _sturdy_ are said only of persons or things personal; as a _robust_ make, a _robust_ habit; a _sturdy_ air, a _sturdy_ stroke.

####stupid 
**STUPID, DULL.**  
_Stupid_, in Latin _stupidus_, from _stupere_, to be amazed or bewildered, expresses an amazement which is equivalent to a deprivation of understanding: _dull_, Anglo-Saxon _dol_, foolish, is connected with the German _toll_, and denotes a simple deficiency. _Stupidity_ in its proper sense is natural to a man, although a particular circumstance may have a similar effect upon the understanding; he who is questioned in the presence of others may appear very _stupid_ in that which is otherwise very familiar to him. _Dull_ is an incidental quality, arising principally from the state of the animal spirits: a writer may sometimes be _dull_ in a large circle, while he is very lively in private intercourse.

####suavity 
**SUAVITY, URBANITY.**  
_Suavity_ is, literally, sweetness; and _urbanity_ the refinement of the city, in distinction from the country: inasmuch, therefore, as a polite education tends to soften the mind and the manners, it produces _suavity;_ but _suavity_ may sometimes arise from natural temper, and exist, therefore, without _urbanity;_ although there cannot be _urbanity_ without _suavity._ By the _suavity_ of our manners we gain the love of those around us; by the _urbanity_ of our manners we render ourselves agreeable companions: hence also arises another distinction, that the term _suavity_ may be applied to other things, as the voice or the style; but _urbanity_ to manners only. 

####subdue 
See [conquer](entry://conquer); [overbear](entry://overbear); [quell](entry://quell); [subject](entry://subject)

####subject 
**SUBJECT, LIABLE, LIKELY, EXPOSED, OBNOXIOUS.**  
_Subject_, in Latin _subjectus_, participle of _subicere_, to cast under, signifies thrown underneath. _Liable_ is compounded with the suffix _able_, from Old French _lier_, to tie, Latin _ligare. Exposed_ is the participle of the verb _expose_, from Latin _ex_, and French _poser_, for the derivation of which see [compose](entry://compose). _Obnoxious_, in Latin _obnoxius_, compounded of _ob_, on account of, and _noxius_, hurtful, signifies in the way of hurting.  
All these terms are applied to those circumstances in human life by which we are affected independently of our own choice. Direct necessity is included in the term _subject;_ whatever we are obliged to suffer, that we are _subject_ to; we may apply remedies to remove the evil, but often in vain: _liable_ conveys more the idea of casualties; and _likely_ that of mere probability; we are _likely_ to encounter good fortune, but are _liable_ to incur disasters: we may suffer that which we are _liable_ to, but we may also escape the evil if we are careful: _exposed_ conveys the idea of a passive state, into which we may be brought either through our own means or through the instrumentality of others; we are _exposed_ to that which we are not in a condition to keep off from ourselves; it is frequently not in our power to guard against the evil: _obnoxious_ signifies properly _exposed_ to the harm of anything; as _obnoxious_ to the multitude, that is, _exposed_ to their resentment: a person may avoid bringing himself into this state, but he cannot avoid the consequences which will ensue from being thus involved. We are _subject_ to disease or _subject_ to death; this is the irrevocable law of our nature: delicate people are _liable_ to catch cold; all persons are _liable_ to make mistakes: a person is _exposed_ to insults who provokes the anger of a low-bred man: a minister sometimes renders himself _obnoxious_ to the people.  
_Subject, liable_, and _exposed_ may be applied to things as well as persons, with a similar distinction: things are _subject_ by nature, as _subject_ to decay; _liable_ by accident, as _liable_ to be broken; _exposed_ by situation, or for want of protection, as _exposed_ to the cutting winds. _Obnoxious_ is said only of persons or that which is personal.  
To _subject_ and _expose_, as verbs, are taken in the same sense: a person _subjects_ himself to impertinent freedom by descending to unseemly familiarities with his inferiors; he _exposes_ himself to the derision of his equals by an affectation of superiority.  
**SUBJECT, SUBORDINATE, INFERIOR, SUBSERVIENT.** — _Subject_ (see above). _Subordinate_, compounded of _sub_ and _ordinem_, signifies to be in an order that is under others. _Inferior_, in Latin _inferior_, is the comparative of _inferus_, low, which has no relation to _infero_, to cast into. _Subservient_, compounded of _sub_ and _servio_, signifies serving under something else.  
These terms may express either the relation of persons to persons or things or of things to things. _Subject_ in the first case respects the exercise of power; _subordinate_ is said of the station and office; _inferior_, either of a man's outward circumstances or of his merits and qualifications; _subservient_, of one's relative services to another, but always in a bad sense. According to the law of nature, a child should be _subject_ to his parents: according to the law of a realm, he must be _subject_ to his prince: the good order of society cannot be rightly maintained unless there be some to act in a _subordinate_ capacity: men of _inferior_ talent have a part to act which, in the aggregate, is of no less importance than that which is sustained by men of the highest endowments: men of no principle or character will be most _subservient_ to the base purposes of those who pay them best. It is the part of the ruler to protect the _subject_, and of the _subject_ to love and honor the ruler: it is the part of the exalted to treat the _subordinate_ with indulgence, and of the latter to show respect to those under whom they are placed: it is the part of the superior to instruct, assist, and encourage the _inferior;_ it is the part of the latter to be willing to learn, ready to obey, and prompt to execute. It is not necessary for any one to act the degrading part of being _subservient_ to another.  
In the second instance _subject_ has the same sense as in the preceding article, when taken in the relation of things to things; _subordinate_ designates the degree of relative importance between things: _inferior_ designates every circumstance which can render things comparatively higher or lower; _subservient_ designates the relative utility of things under certain circumstances, but not always in the bad sense. All things in this world are _subject_ to change: matters of _subordinate_ consideration ought to be entirely eliminated when any great object is to be attained: things of _inferior_ value must necessarily sell for an _inferior_ price: there is nothing so insignificant that it may not be made _subservient_ to some purpose.  
** SUBJECT, SUBJUGATE, SUBDUE.** — _Subject_ signifies to make subject. _Subjugate_, from _jugum_, a yoke, signifies to bring under the yoke. _Subdue_ (see [conquer](entry://conquer)).  
_Subject_ is here the generic the two other specific terms: we may s_ubject_ either individuals or nations; but we _subjugate_ only nations. We _subject_ ourselves to reproof, to inconvenience, or to the influence of our passions; one nation _subjugates_ another: _subjugate_ and _subdue_ are both employed with regard to nations that are compelled to submit to the conqueror: but _subjugate_ expresses even more than _subdue_, for it implies to bring into a state of permanent submission; whereas to _subdue_ may be only a nominal and temporary subjection: Caesar _subjugated_ the Gauls, for he made them _subjects_ of the Roman Empire: but Alexander _subdued_ the Indian nations, who revolted after his departure.

####submarine 
**SUBMARINE, SUBMERSIBLE, U-BOAT.**  
These words do not differ in meaning, but there is a slight variation in their usage and application. They all indicate a boat propelled entirely under water. In the hands of the Germans, in the European war, the _submarine_ became an exceedingly dangerous and lawless mode of offence, and the source of an infinite complication of international relations which eventually brought the United States into the war and necessitated a reconsideration of all the laws of honorable warfare and international usage. _Submarine_ is the most general term. It means, literally, "under-sea" craft, from Latin _sub_, under, and _mare_, sea. _Submersible_ is a descriptive term sometimes substituted for _submarine_, especially by newspaper reporters anxiously in search of something to break the monotony of the endless repetition of a term to which the war gave such a general currency. It means a boat that _submerges_ or dips under the water, from Latin _sub_, under, and _mergere_, to dip. _U-boat_, a semi-transcription, semi-translation of the German _U_ or _Unterseeboote_, was originally applied to German submarines of the type of the U-53 which visited the shores of the United States in the autumn of 1916, and attacked ships of the Allies lying just beyond the three-mile line. In popular usage it was soon applied to all German submarines armed to attack the ships of the Allies.

####subside 
**SUBSIDE, ABATE, INTERMIT.**  
_Sub-aide_, from the Latin _sub_ and _sedeo_, signifies to settle to the bottom. _Abate_ (see that word). _Intermit_, from the Latin _inter_ and _mitto_, signifies to leave a space or interval between.  
A settlement after agitation is the peculiar meaning of _subside._ That which has been put into commotion subsides: heavy particles _subside_ in a fluid that is at rest, and tumults are said to _subside:_ a diminution of strength characterizes the meaning of _abate;_ that which has been high in action may _abate;_ the rain _abates_ after it has been heavy, and a man's anger _abates:_ alternate action and rest is implied in the word _intermit;_ whatever is in action may sometimes cease from action; labor without _intermission_ is out of the power of man. 

####subsist

####subsistence

####substantial 
**SUBSTANTIAL, SOLID.**  
_Substantial_, based on _sub_, under and _stare_, to stand, signifies to be present, to exist, and hence having a substance: _solid_, from Latin _solidus_, based on _solum_, the ground (which meant originally that which is whole, entire), signifies having a firm foundation. The _substantial_ is opposed to that which is thin and has no consistency: the _solid_ is opposed to the liquid or that which is of loose consistency. All objects which admit of being handled are in their nature _substantial;_ those which are of so hard a texture as to require to be cut are _solid. Substantial_ food is that which has a consistency in itself and is capable of giving fulness to the empty stomach: _solid_ food is meat in distinction from drink: so _substantial_ beings are such as consist of flesh and blood, and may be touched, in distinction from those which are airy or spiritual: the earth is _solid_ which is so hardened as not to yield to pressure.  
So in the moral application, the _substantial_ is opposed to that which exists in the mind only and which is frequently fictitious; as a _substantial_ benefit, as distinguished from that which gratifies the mind: the _solid_ is that which rests on reason and has the properties of durability and reality, as a _solid_ reputation.

####succession 
**SUCCESSION, SERIES, ORDER.**  
_Succession_, signifying the act or state of _succeeding_ (see [follow](entry://follow)), is a matter of necessity or casualty: things _succeed_ each other, or they are taken in _succession_ either arbitrarily or by design: the _series_ (see that word) is a connected _succession;_ the _order_ (see [place](entry://place)), the _ordered_ or arranged _succession._ We observe the _succession_ of events as a matter of curiosity; we trace the _series_ of events as a matter of intelligence; we follow the _order_ which the historian has pursued as a matter of judgment; the _succession_ may be slow or quick; the _series_ may be long or short; the _order_ may be correct or incorrect. The present age has afforded a quick _succession_ of events, and presented us with a series of atrocious attempts to disturb the peace of society under the pretence of self-protection. The historian of these times needs only pursue the _order_ which the events themselves point out.  
**SUCCESSIVE, ALTERNATE.** — What is successive follows directly; what is _alternate_ follows indirectly. A minister preaches _successively_ who preaches every Sunday uninterruptedly at the same hour; but he preaches _alternately_ if he preaches every other Sunday, or on one Sunday in the morning and the other Sunday in the afternoon, at the same place. The _successive_ may be accidental or intentional; the _alternate_ is always intentional; it may rain for three _successive_ days or a fair may be held for three _successive_ days: trees are placed sometimes in _alternate_ order when every other tree is of the same size and kind.

####sudden 
**SUDDEN, ABRUPT, PRECIPITATE.**  
_Sudden_, from Old French _sodain_, Low Latin _subitanus_ (for _subitaneus)_, Latin _subitus_, is derived ultimately from Latin _subire_, past participle _subitus_, meaning to come upon one by stealth, to arrive or go unexpectedly. It denotes that which happens quickly and unexpectedly. _Abrupt_ and _precipitate_ express the same idea under a metaphor. _Abrupt_ (see [abrupt](entry://abrupt)) means literally "broken off" — something so unrelated to other things that it seems like something suddenly broken off. An _abrupt_ movement is a _sudden_ movement with a certain sharpness and decisiveness in the _suddenness. Precipitate_, from Latin _pros_, before, and _cipiti_, the stem of _prœceps_, based on _caput_, head, means literally head-foremost. It refers to something that is not merely _sudden_, but is a little ahead of time.

####suffocate 
**SUFFOCATE, STIFLE, SMOTHER, CHOKE.**  
_Suffocate_, in Latin _suffocatus_, participle of _suffocare_, compounded of _sub_ and _faux_, throat, signifies to constrain or tighten the throat. For _stifle_ and _smother_ see [stifle](entry://stifle). _Choke_, from Middle English _choken_, is allied to Icelandic _koka_, to gulp, and _kok_, the throat.  
These terms express the act of stopping the breath, but under various circumstances and by various means; _suffocation_ is produced by every kind of means, external or internal, and is therefore the most general of these terms; _stifling_ proceeds by internal means, that is, by the admission of foreign bodies into the passages which lead to the respiratory organs: we may be _suffocated_ by excluding the air externally, as by gagging, confining closely, or pressing violently: we may be _suffocated_ or _stifled_ by means of vapors, close air, or smoke. To _smother_ is to _suffocate_ by the exclusion of air externally, as by means of any substance with which one is covered or surrounded, as smoke, dust, and the like: to _choke_ is a mode of _stifling_ by means of large bodies, as by a piece of food lodging in the throat.  
To _choke_, in an extended and figurative sense, is to interrupt the action of any body by the intervention of any foreign substance, as a garden is _choked_ with weeds; to _stifle_ is altogether to put a stop or end to a thing by keeping it down, as to _stifle_ resentment, sighs, etc.: to _smother_ is to _choke_ or prevent free action by covering or surrounding, as good resolutions are _smothered_ by unruly desires or appetites.

####superb 
**SUPERB, AUGUST, STATELY.**  
These words have in common the idea of pride and dignity and external splendor. _Superb_, from Latin _superbus_, proud, is often used simply as a general superlative. It means excellent, with a special emphasis upon that which is externally striking and complete. _August_ is derived from the name of the Roman Cæsars, _Augustus._ It denotes that which is impressive and awe-inspiring in the last degree — a union of dignity and power both unlimited. In this sense we speak of the _august_ power of God, etc. _Stately_ means full of _state_, something full of dignity, with special emphasis upon the idea of stability and endurance. It does not denote the complete and striking impression produced by that which is _superb_ nor the awe inspired by that which is _august_, but lays a greater emphasis upon the single impression of external and stable dignity. 

####superficial 
**SUPERFICIAL, SHALLOW, FLIMSY.**  
The _superficial_ is that which lies only at the surface; it is therefore by implication the same as the _shallow_, which has nothing underneath. Hence a person may be called either _superficial_ or _shallow_ to indicate that he has not a profundity of knowledge; but, otherwise, _superficiality_ is applied to the exercise of the thinking faculty and _shallowness_ to its extent. Men of freely expressed sentiments may be _superficial_ thinkers, although they may not have understandings more _shallow_ than others. _Superficial_ and _shallow_ are applicable to things as well as persons: _flimsy_ is applicable to things only. _Flimsy_ (from Welsh _llymsi?_ cf. the American dialect word _limsy;_ or perhaps connected with _film)_ is a modern word. In the proper sense we may speak of giving a _superficial_ covering of paint or color to a body; of a river or piece of water being _shallow;_ of cotton or cloth being _flimsy._  
In the improper sense, a survey or a glance may be _superficial_ which does not extend beyond the _superficies_ of things; a conversation or a discourse may be _shallow_ which does not contain a basis of sentiment; and a work or performance may be _flimsy_ which has nothing solid in it to engage the attention.

####supreme 
**SUPREME, PREDOMINANT, PREEMINENT.**  
All these words mean surpassing in power or in importance. _Predominant_, from Latin _prœ_, above, before, and _dominari_, to rule, meant ruling over others. _Pre-eminent_, from Latin _prœ_, and _eminere_, to project, means projecting beyond others. _Preeminent_ indicates a state of being, _predominant_ one of action. At the same time _pre-eminent_ is a stronger word than _predominant._ That which is _predominant_ asserts its power over others, that which is _pre-eminent_ stands out so that all see and recognize the superiority. _Pre-eminent_ implies a more lasting superiority than _predominant_, which implies a state of struggle in which the first place may be yielded to another. _Supreme_, from Latin _supremus_, means holding the first place of all, beyond rivalry and comparison, possessing neither a superior nor an equal. It expresses the highest possible degree of _pre-eminence._

####surface 
**SURFACE, SUPERFICIES.**  
_Surface_, compounded of French _sur_, for _super_, and _face_, from _faciem_, is a variation of the Latin term _superficies;_ and yet they have acquired this distinction, that the former is the current and the latter the scientific term; of course the former has a more indefinite and general application than the latter. A _surface_ is either even or uneven, smooth or rough; but the mathematician always conceives of a plane _superficies_ on which he founds his operations.  
_Surface_, in its moral application, is extended to whatever presents itself first to the mind of the observer.  
_Superficies_ may be applied in its proper and definite sense to other objects than those which relate to science.

####surround 
**SURROUND, ENCOMPASS, ENVIRON, ENCIRCLE.**  
_Surround_, from Old French _suronder_, meant originally to overflow, from _super_, over, and _unda_, a wave. _Encompass_ is compounded of French _en_, in, and _compas_, from Low Latin _compassus_, a circle or circuit, and meaning a going around in a circle till the last step ends where the first began. To _encompass_ is to enclose in a circle. _Environ_ comes from Old French _en_, in, and _virer_, to turn, whence _veer_ is derived. _Encircle_ means to enclose within a circle. _Blockade_ is formed, with the suffix _ode_, from _block_, derived through Old French, from Dutch. It now means a blocking of the coasts of a hostile country by encompassing it with ships which prevent merchant-vessels from getting through with supplies; but it has been used to signify any blocking up of all exit or entrance by surrounding troops or fortifications.  
_Surround_ is the most literal and general of all these terms, which signify to enclose any object either directly or indirectly. We may _surround_ an object by standing at certain distances all round it; in this manner a person may be _surrounded_ by other persons, and a house _surrounded_ with trees, or an object may be _surrounded_ by enclosing it in every direction and at every point; in this manner a garden is _surrounded_ by a wall. To _encompass_ is to _surround_ in the latter sense, and applies to objects of a great or indefinite extent: the earth is _encompassed_ by the air, which we term the atmosphere; towns are _encompassed_ by walls. To _surround_ is to go round an object of any form, whether square or circular, long or short; but to _environ_ and to _encircle_ carry with them the idea of forming a circle round an object; thus a town or valley may be _environed_ by hills, a basin of water may be _encircled_ by trees, or the head may be _encircled_ by a wreath of flowers.  
In an extended or moral sense we are said to be _surrounded_ by objects which are in great numbers and in different directions about us: thus a person living in a particular spot where he has many friends may say he is _surrounded_ by his friends, or _environed_ by objects in such manner that he cannot escape from them; so likewise a particular person may say that he is _surrounded_ by dangers and difficulties: but, in speaking of man in a general sense, we should rather say he is _encompassed_ by dangers, which expresses in a much stronger manner our peculiarly exposed condition. _Blockade_ may be figuratively applied to any cutting off of supplies.

####sustain 
**SUSTAIN, SUPPORT, MAINTAIN.**  
_Sustain_, from Old French _sustenir_, compounded of _sus_ or _sub_ and _tenere_, to hold, signifies to hold or keep up. _Support_ (see [countenance](entry://countenance)). _Maintain (see_ ASSERT).  
The idea of keeping up or preventing from falling is common to these terms, which vary either in the mode or object of the action. To _sustain_ and _support_ are frequently passive, _maintain_ is always active. To _sustain_ and _support_ both imply the bearing or receiving the weight of any object, the former in reference to any great weight, the latter to any weight however small.  
_Sustain_ and _support_ may also imply an active exercise of power or means which brings them still nearer to _maintain;_ in this case _sustain_ is an act of the highest power, _support_ of any ordinary power.  
So in bearing up against any opposing force; but _support_ is here an act for the benefit of others; _maintain_ is an act for one's own benefit, as to _sustain_ a shock, to _support_ one another in battle; to _maintain_ one's self in a contest.  
Existence is said to be _sustained_ under circumstances of weakness or pressure; it is _supported_ by natural means, as the milk of the mother supporte the babe; or indirectly by what supplies the means, as to _support_ one's family by labor: what is _maintained_ is upheld by pecuniary means, as to _maintain_ a family, a fleet, etc.  
In the moral application, what presses on the mind is _sustained_, or _supported_, with the like distinction: grievous losses or injuries are _sustained;_ afflictions and disappointments _supported._  
Things are _supported_ and _maintained_ voluntarily; the former in respect to what is foreign to us, as to _support_ an assumed character, the latter in respect to what belongs to us, as to _maintain_ one's own character.

####swear 
**SWEAR, TAKE OATH, TESTIFY.**  
_Swear_, from Anglo-Saxon _swerian_, originally meant simply to speak loudly; it is the stem found in _answer._ It now means to affirm by an appeal to the powers recognized as holy, to assert in the name of God. To _take oath_ (from Anglo-Saxon _ath)_ means to _swear_ formally by going through the ceremony of taking an oath or making an appeal to God. To _lake oath_ is a somewhat more exact and specific term than _swear_, but it means the same thing. To _testify_, from Latin _testes_, a witness, and a weakened form of _facere_, to make, means literally to make, or bear witness. It is associated with _swear_ and _take oath_ through the fact that a formal bearing of witness is preceded by an oath.

####syllabus 
**SYLLABUS, SYNOPSIS.**  
A _syllabus_, from Late Latin _syllabus_, Late Greek _σύλλαβος_, a list, allied to _συλλαβή_, a syllable, literally "that which holds together, " from Greek _συν_, together, and the aorist stem of _λαμβάνειν_, to take, is an outline or summary of the main points of a subject, course, lecture, or treatise. A _synopsis_, from Greek _σύν_, together, _όψις_, sight, is a complete view of the subject in a brief space. The two words have almost the same meaning, but _synopsis_ emphasizes the summing up, the inclusion of everything in a little space, and _syllabus_ emphasizes the outlining of the points to be made. A _syllabus_ of a course of lectures, for example, is the outline distributed beforehand. The _synopsis_ of a lecture may be given in the newspaper afterward. But _synopsis_ is often used interchangeably with _syllabus_, though _syllabus_ cannot always take the place of _synopsis._

####symbol 
See [figure](entry://figure)

####symmetry 
**SYMMETRY, PROPORTION.**  
_Symmetry_, in Latin _symmetria_, Greek _συμμετρία_, from _σύν_ and _μέτρον_, signifies a measure that accords. _Proportion_, in Latin _proportio_, compounded of _pro_, as regards or in relation to, and _portio_, a part, signifies every portion or part according with the other or with the whole.  
The signification of these terms is obviously the same, namely, a due admeasurement of the parts to each other and to the whole: but _symmetry_ has now acquired but a partial application to the human body or to things nicely fitting each other; and _proportion_ is applied to everything which admits of dimensions and an adaptation of the parts: hence we speak of _symmetry_ of feature; but _proportion_ of limbs, the _proportion_ of the head to the body. 

####sympathy 
**SYMPATHY, COMPASSION, COMMISERATION, CONDOLENCE.**  
_Sympathy_, from the Greek _σύμ_ for _σύν_, with, and _πάθεια_, feeling, has the literal meaning of fellow-feeling, that is, a kindred or like feeling or feeling in company with another. _Compassion_ (see **pity** under [piteous](entry://piteous)); _commiseration_, from the Latin _cum_, with, and _miserari_, to pity; _condolence_, from the Latin _con_ and _dolere_, to grieve, signify a like suffering or a suffering in company. Hence it is obvious that, according to the derivation of the words, the _sympathy_ may be said either of pleasure or pain, the rest only of that which is painful. _Sympathy_ preserves its original meaning in its application, for we laugh or cry by _sympathy;_ this may, however, be a merely physical operation.  
_Compassion_ is altogether a moral feeling which makes us enter into the distresses of others: we may, therefore, _sympathize_ with others, without essentially serving them; but if we feel _compassion_ we naturally turn our thoughts toward relieving them  
_Sympathy_, indeed, may sometimes be taken for a secret alliance or kindred feeling between two objects.  
_Compassion_ is awakened by various kinds of suffering, but particularly by those which are attributable to our misfortunes; _commiseration_ is awakened by suffering arising from our faults; _condolence_ is awakened by the troubles of life, to which all are equally liable. Poverty and want excite our _compassion;_ we endeavor to relieve them: a poor criminal suffering the penalty of the law excites our _commiseration;_ we endeavor, if possible, to mitigate his punishment: the loss which a friend sustains produces _condolence;_ we take the best means of testifying it to him.  
_Compassion_ is the sentiment of one mortal toward another; _commiseration_ is represented as the feeling which our wretchedness excites in the Supreme Being. _Compassion_ may be awakened in persons of any condition; _commiseration_ is awakened toward those who are in an abject state of misery; _condolence_ supposes an entire equality and is often produced by some common calamity. 

####symptom

####synchronous 
**SYNCHRONOUS, SIMULTANEOUS, CONTEMPORANEOUS.**  
These words all mean occurring at the same time. _Simultaneous_, from Late Latin _simultim_, at the same time, contaminated by Latin _momentaneous_, means occurring at exactly the same instant. _Synchronous_, from Greek _σύν_, together, and _κρόνος_, time, means happening within the same period of time, but not necessarily at exactly the same instant. _Synchronous_ and _simultaneous_ are applied to occurrences; _contemporaneous_ to both events and people. _Contemporaneous_ comes from Latin _con_, for _cum_, together, and _tempus_, time; it means living or happening within the same period, the period being thought of not merely as a division of time, as in the case of _synchronous_, but as an age, a generation, a period marked by certain characteristics distinguishing it from other periods. 

####synod 
See **assembly** under [assemble](entry://assemble)

####synthetic 
**SYNTHETIC, CONSTRUCTIVE.**  
_Synthetic_, from Greek _σύν_, with, and _θετικός_, skilled in putting together, from _συνθέτης_, a putter-together, and _constructive_, from Latin _con_, together, and _structus_, the past participle of _struere_, a heaping up, both mean putting together. _Synthetic_ is opposed to _analytic_, and _constructive_ to _destructive. Synthetic_ refers merely to an intellectual process, _constructive_ to moral attitude and practical building up. _Synthetic_ is more limited in its application, but more exact within its own field. It means putting together the constituent elements of a conception in such a way as to form an intellectual whole, a single idea. _Constructive_ means in general building up. _Constructive_ criticism is that which not merely destroys an old method or standard, but builds up a new one. _Constructive_ social work is that which builds up a new order of society instead of merely destroying what was bad in the old régime. It implies active creation, which is not necessarily purely intellectual, and is often consciously opposed to the idea of _destructive._

####system 
**SYSTEM, METHOD.**  
_System_, in Latin _systema_, Greek _σύστημα_, from _ανστημι_, or _σύν_ and _ίστημι_, to stand together, signifies that which is put together so as to form a whole. _Method_, in Latin _methodus_, is from the Greek _μεθ'_, for, _μετά_, after, and _οδός_, a way, the literal sense thus being a way after, or a way by which anything is effected.  
_System_ expresses more than _method_, which is but a part of _system: system_ is an arrangement of many single or individual objects according to some given rule, so as to make them coalesce; _method is_ the manner of this arrangement, or the principle upon which this arrangement takes place. The term _system_, however, applies to a complexity of objects, but arrangement, and consequently _method_, may be. applied to everything that is to be put into execution. All sciences must be reduced to _system;_ and without _system_ there is no science: all business requires _method;_ and without _method_ little can be done to any good purpose.

####tactics 
**TACTICS, GENERALSHIP, MANŒUVRING, STRATEGY.**  
_Tactics_, from Greek τακτικός, fit for arranging, means the art of handling troops on the field of battle. _Strategy_, from Greek _στρατηγία_, signifies the art of projecting and planning a military movement. _Strategy_ represents an intellectual achievement; _tactics_, a practical carrying out of that which has been directed by strategy. _Manœuvring_, through French, from Late Latin _man(u)opera_, a working with the hand _(manus_, hand, and _opera_, work), means the making of adroit or artful moves on the field of battle, the control of the troops in such a way as to bring about a desired result. It differs from _tactics_ in emphasizing simply skilful movement.

####take 
**TAKE, RECEIVE, ACCEPT.**  
_Take_, Middle English _taken_, is a Scandinavian word signifying to lay hold of. _Receive_, in Old French _recever_, Latin _recipere_, from _re_, back, and a weakened form of _capere_, to take, signifies to take back; and _accept_, from _accipere_, of a similar derivation _(ac_ = ad, for), signifies to _take_ for a special purpose.  
To _take_ is the general term, _receive_ and _accept_ are modes of taking. To _take_ is an unqualified action; we _take_ whatever comes in the way; we _receive_ only that which is offered or sent: we _take_ a book from a table; we _receive_ a parcel which has been sent; we _take_ either with or without consent; we _receive_ with the consent, or according to the wishes, of another: a robber _takes_ money from a traveller; a person _receives_ a letter from a friend.  
To _receive_ is frequently a passive act; whatever is offered or done to another is _received;_ but to _accept_ is an act of choice: many things, therefore, may be _received_ which cannot be _accepted;_ as a person _receives_ a blow or an insult: so in an engagement one may be said to _receive_ the enemy, who is ready to _receive_ his attack; on the other hand, we _accept_ apologies.  
Some things are both _received_ and _accepted_, but with the same distinction. What is given as a present may be both _received_ and _accepted_, but the inferior _receives_ and the superior _accepts._ What is _received_ comes to a person either by indirect means or, if by direct means, it comes as a matter of right; but what is _accepted_ is a matter of favor either on the part of the giver or receiver. Rent in law may be both _received_ and _accepted;_ it is _received_ when it is due from the tenant after he has broken his contract with his landlord. A challenge may be _received_ contrary to the wishes of the _receiver_, but it rests with himself whether he will _accept_ it or not.  
Animals and things, as well as persons, may _take;_ things may _receive;_ but persons only _accept._ An animal may _take_ what is offered to it; things _take_ whatever attaches to them, but they _receive_ that which by an express effort is given to them. The chameleon is said to _take_ its hue from the surrounding objects; marble _receives_ its polish from the hands of the workman.

####talkative 
**TALKATIVE, LOQUACIOUS, GARRULOUS.**  
_Talkative_, ready or prone to _talk_, from Middle English _talken_, to talk, from _talen_, to tell tales, Anglo-Saxon _talian_, to reckon or compute. _Loquacious_, from _loquari_, to speak or talk, has the same original meaning. _Garrulous_, in Latin _garrulus_, from _garrire_, to blab, signifies prone to tell or make known.  
These reproachful epithets differ principally in the degree. To _talk_ is allowable, and consequently it is not altogether so unbecoming to be occasionally _talkative;_ but _loquacity_, which implies an immoderate propensity to _talk_, is always bad, whether springing from affection or an idle temper: and _garrulity_, which arises from the excessive desire of communicating, is a failing that is pardonable only in the aged, who have generally much to tell.

####tally 
**TALLY, MATCH.**  
A _tally_ was originally a piece of wood (Low Latin _talea_, French _taille)_ on which notches were cut to indicate number; it was a way of keeping a reckoning. _Match_ comes from the stem found in Anglo-Saxon _gemœcca_, a companion. To _tally_ means to correspond exactly with something that serves as a standard of measurement. To _match_ is to be like another thing, to fit something so that the result is a harmonious whole. It is therefore less specific than _tally. Tally_ indicates an exact correspondence, one that satisfies the desire for accurate knowledge. _Match_ may refer to a correspondence that merely satisfies the taste. 

####tame

####tangible 
**TANGIBLE, OBVIOUS, REAL.**  
_Tangible_ means literally _touchable_, that which can be handled, from Latin _tangere_, to touch. _Obvious_, from Latin _ob_, opposite, and _via_, way, means lying in the way of. A _tangible_ object is not necessarily _obvious_ nor an _obvious_ one _tangible_, but the two words have in common the idea of easily perceived. In the one case the means of perception is the sense of touch; in the other case it may be any of the senses, but especially the sense of sight. _Tangible_ is used figuratively to denote anything that may be readily grasped by the mind and proved to exist; in this sense we speak of a _tangible_ reason, of _tangible_ evidence, etc. _Real_, from Low Latin _realis_, derived from res, thing, and a suffix, is applied to those things which have an actual existence. Where the proof of existence is thought to be demonstrable by the senses, _real_ means having a physical form.

####taste 
**TASTE, FLAVOR, RELISH, SAVOR.**  
_Taste_ comes from the Teutonic _tasten_, to touch lightly, and signifies either the organs which are easily affected or the act of discriminating by a light touch of the organ or the quality of the object which affects the organs; in this latter sense it is closely allied to the other terms. _Flavor_ most probably comes through Old French _fleür, flaür_, from the Latin _flare_, to blow, to breathe, signifying the rarefied essence of bodies which affect the organ of _taste. Relish_ was originally an after-taste, from Old French _reles_, that which is left behind, from _relaxare_, to loosen, to allow to rest, to leave behind. _Savor_ comes through French from Latin sopor, smell, taste, the _ν_ being analogical from _savor. Taste_ is the most general and indefinite of all these; it is applicable to every object that can be applied to the organs of _taste_, and to every degree and manner in which the organs can be affected: some things are _tasteless_, other things have a strong _taste_, and others a mixed _taste_. The _flavor_ is the predominating _taste_ and consequently is applied to such objects as may have a different kind or degree of _taste;_ an apple may have not only the general _taste_ of apple, but also a _flavor_ peculiar to itself; the _flavor_ is commonly said of that which is good; as a fine _flavor_, a delicious _flavor;_ but it may designate that which is not always agreeable; as the _flavor_ of fish, which is unpleasant in things that do not admit of such a _taste._ The _relish_ is also a particular _taste;_ but it is that which is artificial, in distinction from the _flavor_, which may be the natural property. We find the _flavor_ such as it is; we give the _relish_ such as it should be or as we wish it to be: milk and butter receive a _flavor_ from the nature of the food with which the cow is supplied: sauces are used in order to give a _relish_ to the food that is dressed with them.  
_Savor_ is a term in less frequent use than the others, but, conforming to the Latin derivation, it is employed to designate that which smells as well as _tastes_, a sweet-smelling _savor;_ so likewise, in the moral application, a man's actions or expressions may be said to _savor_ of vanity.  
_Taste_ and _relish_ may be, moreover, compared as the act or power of _tasting_ or _relishing:_ we _taste_ whatever affects our _taste_, but we _relish_ that only which pleases our _taste:_ we _taste_ fruits in order to determine whether they are good or bad; we _relish_ fruits as a dessert or at certain seasons of the day.  
So in the extended or moral application, the words are distinguished in the same manner.  
**TASTE, GENIUS.** — _Taste_, in another sense, designates the capacity to derive pleasure from an object: _genius_ designates the power we have for accomplishing any object. He who derives particular pleasure from music may be said to have a _taste_ for music; he who makes very great proficiency in the theory and practice of music may be said to have a _genius_ for it. It is obvious, therefore, that we may have a _taste_ without having _genius;_ but it would not be possible to have _genius_ for a thing without having a _taste_ for it: for nothing can so effectually give a _taste_ for any accomplishment as that capacity to learn it and that susceptibility to all its beauties, which are circumstances inseparable from _genius._

The idea of something given by the people to the government is expressed by all these terms. _Tax_ comes through French from the substantive based on Late Latin _taxare_ (ultimately from _tangere)_, to touch, to handle, also to rate, value, appraise, whence Low Latin _taxa_, a tax, signifying the handling and appraising of valuables. _Custom_ signifies that which is given under certain circumstances, according to _custom_, from Old French _costume_, based on an assumed neuter plural, _consuetumina_, derived from classical _consuetudo_, custom. _Duty_ signifies that which is given as a due or debt. _Toll_, in Anglo-Saxon _tall_, etc., Low Latin _tolonium_, classical _toloneum_, Greek _τέλος_, a custom, signifies a particular kind of _custom_ or due.  
_Tax_ is the most general of these terms, and applies to or implies whatever is paid by the people to the government, according to a certain estimate: the _customs_ are a species of _tax_ which are less specific than other _taxes_, being regulated by _custom_ rather than any definite law; the _customs_ apply particularly to what was _customarily_ given by merchants for the goods which they imported from abroad: the _duty_ is a species of _tax_ more positive and binding than the _custom_, being a specific estimate of what is _due_ upon goods, according to their value; hence it is not only applied to goods that are imported, but also to many other articles inland: _toll_ is that species of _tax_ which serves for the repair of roads and havens, or the liberty to buy or sell at fairs or other places.  
The preceding terms refer to that which is levied by authority on the people; but they do not directly express the idea of levying or paying: _impost_, on the contrary, signifies, literally, that which is imposed; and _tribute_ that which is paid or yielded; the former, therefore, exclude that idea of coercion which is included in the latter. The _tax_ is levied by the consent of many, the _impost_ is imposed by the will of one, and the _tribute_ is paid at the demand of one or a few: the _tax_ serves for the support of the nation; the _impost_ and the _tribute_ serve to enrich a government. Conquerors lay heavy _imposts_ upon the conquered countries; distant provinces pay a _tribute_ to the princes to whom they owe allegiance. _Contribution_ signifies the _tribute_ of many in unison or for the same end; in this general sense it includes all the other terms; for _taxes_ and _imposts_ are paid alike by many for the same purpose; but, as the predominant idea in _contribution_ is that of common consent, it supposes a degree of freedom in the agent which is incompatible with the exercise of authority expressed by the other terms: hence the term is with more propriety applied to those cases in which men voluntarily unite in giving toward any particular object, as charitable _contributions_, or _contributions_ in support of a war; but it may be taken in the general sense of a forced payment, as in speaking of military _contribution._ These words, _tax, tribute_, and _contribution_, have an extended application to other objects besides those which are pecuniary: _tax_, in the sense of what is laid on without the consent of the person on whom it is imposed; _tribute_, that which is given to another as his due; and _contribution_, that which is given by one in common with others for some common object.  
**TAX, BATE, ASSESSMENT.** — _Tax_, according to the above explanation, and _rate_, from the Latin _ratus_ and _reor_, to think or estimate, both derive their principal meaning from the valuation or proportion, according to which any sum is demanded from the people; but the _tax_ is imposed directly by the government for public purposes, as the land-_tax_ and the window-_tax_; and the _rate_ is imposed indirectly for the local purposes of each parish, as the church-_rates_, and the poor-_rates_. The _tax_ or _rate_ is a general rule or ratio by which a certain sum is raised upon a given number of persons; the _assessment_ is the application of that rule to the individual.

####tease 
**TEASE, VEX, TAUNT, TANTALIZE, TORMENT.**  
_Tease_ is developed from Anglo-Saxon _tœsan_, to card wool, to pluck or pull, and hence, in a figurative sense, meaning to _vex_ or _tease. Vex_ (see [displease](entry://displease)). _Taunt_ is from the French _tenter_, Latin _tentare_, to tempt, to try or test. _Tantalize_ (see [aggravate](entry://aggravate)). _Torment_, from the Latin _tormentum_ and _torquere_, to twist, signifies to give pain by twisting or griping.  
The idea of acting upon others so as to produce a painful sentiment is common to all these terms; they differ in the mode of action and in the degree of the effect. To _tease_ is applied to that which is most trifling; _torment_ to that which is most serious. We are _teased_ by a jocose friend, or we are _vexed_ by the carelessness and stupidity of our servants; we are _taunted_ by the sarcasms of others; we are _tantalized_ by the fair prospects which present themselves only to disappear again; we are _tormented_ by the importunities of troublesome beggars. It is the repetition of unpleasant trifles which _teases;_ it is the crossness and perversity of persons and things which _vex;_ it is the contemptuous and provoking behavior which _taunts;_ it is the disappointment of awakened expectations which _tantalizes;_ it. is the repetition of grievous troubles which _torments._ We are _tormented_ by that which produces bodily or mental pain; we are _teased, vexed, taunted_, and _tantalized_ only in the mind. Irritable and nervous people are most easily _teased;_ captious and fretful people are most easily _vexed_ or _taunted;_ sanguine and eager people are most easily _tantalized:_ in all these cases the imagination or the bodily state of the individual serves to increase the pain: but persons are _tormented_ by such things as inflict positive pain.

####tegument 
**TEGUMENT, COVERING.**  
_Tegument_, in Latin _tegumentum_, from _tegere_, to cover, is properly but another word to express the sense of _covering_, yet it is now employed in eases where the term _covering_ is inadmissible. _Covering_ signifies mostly that which is artificial; but _tegument_ is employed for that which is natural; clothing is the _covering_ for the body; the skin of vegetable substances, as seeds, is called the _tegument._ The _covering_ is said of that which covers the outer surface: the _tegument_ is said of that which covers the inner surface; the pods of some seeds are lined with a soft _tegument._

_Temperament_ and _temperature_ are both used to express that state which arises from the tempering of opposite or varying qualities; the _temperament_ is said of animal bodies and the _temperature_ of the atmosphere. Men of a sanguine _temperament_ ought to be cautious in their diet; all bodies are strongly affected by the _temperature_ of the air.

####temple 
**TEMPLE, CHURCH.**  
These words designate an edifice destined for the exercise of religion, but with collateral ideas which sufficiently distinguish them from each other. The _templum_ of the Latins signified originally an open, elevated spot (the name being derived through Latin _temulum_, from Greek _τέμενος_, a sacred enclosure, from _τέμνειν_, to cut), marked out by the augurs with their _lituus_, or sacred wand, whence they could best survey the heavens on all sides: the idea, therefore, of spacious, open, and elevated enters into the meaning of this word. The Greek _ναός_, from _ναίω_, to inhabit, signifies a dwelling-place, and, by distinction, the dwelling-place of the Almighty, in which sense the Hebrew word is also taken to denote the high and holy place where Jehovah peculiarly dwelleth, otherwise called the _holy heavens_, Jehovah's dwelling or resting-place; whence St. Paul calls our bodies the _temples_ of God when the Spirit of God dwelleth in us. The Roman poets used the word _templum_ in a similar sense.  
The word _temple_, therefore, strictly signifies a spacious open place set apart for the peculiar presence and worship of the Divine Being: it is applied with particular propriety to the sacred edifices of the Jews, but may be applied to any sacred place without distinction of religion.  
_Church_ is an interesting word because it seems to have been a term taken over by the northern barbarians into the Teutonic tongues directly from Greek, some time before they were Christianized. There is nothing corresponding to it in Latin, the usual intermediary between Greek and English. It is in Greek _κυριακόν_, a church, neuter of _κυριακός_ (from _κύριος_, Lord), and signifies literally House of the Lord. A _church_ is therefore a building consecrated to the Lord, and from the earliest periods of building _churches_ this was done by some solemn ordinance.  
The word _church_ has by a figure of speech been applied to any building consecrated to the service of God.  
_Church_, in the sense of a religious assembly, is altogether a different word, bearing no affinity to the word _temple._

####temporal 
See [secular](entry://secular)

####temporary 
**TEMPORARY, TRANSIENT, TRANSITORY, FLEETING.**  
_Temporary_, from _tempus_, time, characterizes that which is intended to last only for a time, in distinction from that which is permanent; offices depending upon a state of war are _temporary_, in distinction from those which are connected with internal policy: _transient_, that is, passing, or in the act of passing, characterizes what in its nature exists only for the moment: a glance is _transient. Transitory_, that is, apt to pass away, characterizes everything in the world which is formed only to exist for a time and then to pass away; thus our pleasures, and our pains, and our very being, are denominated _transitory. Fleeting_, which is derived from Anglo-Saxon _fleotan_, to float, is but a stronger term to express the same idea as _transitory._

####tenacious 
**TENACIOUS, PERTINACIOUS.**  
To be _tenacious_ is to hold a thing close, to let it go with reluctance: to be _pertinacious_ is to hold it out in spite of what can be advanced against it, the prepositive syllable _per_ having an intensive force. A man of a _tenacious_ temper insists on matters which he considers important; one of a _pertinacious_ temper insists on every trifle which is apt to affect his opinions. _Tenacity_ may be a virtue or a vice, depending on circumstances; _pertinacity_ is usually a foible: the former, if reprehensible, is more excusable than the latter. We may be _tenacious_ of that which is good, as when a man is _tenacious_ of whatever may affect his honor; but we cannot be _pertinacious_ in anything but our opinions, and that, too, in cases when they are least defensible. It commonly happens that people are most _tenacious_ of being thought to possess that in which they are most deficient, and most _pertinacious_ in maintaining that which is most absurd. A liar is _tenacious_ of his reputation for truth: persons of an iconoclastic tendency are the most _pertinacious_ objectors to whatever is established. 

####tendency 
**TENDENCY, DRIFT, SCOPE, AIM.**  
_Tendency_, from to _tend_, denotes the property of tending toward a certain point, which is the characteristic of all these words, but this is applied only to things; and _drift_, from the Anglo-Saxon _drifan_, modern English _drive_, to drive; _scope_, probably from a Late Latin _scopus_, Greek _σκοπός_, watcher, spy, from _σκέπτομαι_, look; and _aim_, from the verb to aim (see that word), all characterize the thoughts of a person looking forward into futurity and directing his actions to a certain point. Hence we speak of the _tendency_ of certain principles or practices as being pernicious; the _drift_ of a person's discourse; the _scope_ which he gives himself either in treating of a subject or in laying down a plan; or a person's _aim_ to excel, or _aim_ to supplant another, and the like. The _tendency_ of many writings in modern times has been to unsettle the opinions of men: where a person wants the services of another, whom he dares not openly solicit, he will reveal his wishes by the _drift_ of his discourse; a man of a comprehensive mind will allow himself full _scope_ in digesting his plans for every alteration which circumstances may require when they come to be developed: our desires will naturally give a cast to all our _aims;_ and, so long as they are but innocent, they are necessary to give a proper stimulus to exertion.

####tenet 
**TENET, POSITION.**  
The _tenet_ (Latin _tenet_, he holds) is the opinion which we hold in our minds; the _position_ is that which we lay down for others. Our _tenets_ may be hurtful, our _positions_ false. He who gives up his _tenets_ readily evinces an unstable mind; he who argues on a false _position_ shows more tenacity and subtlety than good sense. The _tenets_ of the different denominations of Christians are scarcely to be known or distinguished, inasmuch as they often rest upon such trivial points: the _positions_ which an author lays down must be very definite and clear when he wishes to build upon them any theory or system. See also [doctrine](entry://doctrine)

####tenor 
**TENOR, DRIFT, PURPORT.**  
These words all signify the apparent significance of something, generally of a speech or series of remarks in oral or written form. _Purport_ means the meaning that another is intended _to_ get, the general intent. _Tenor_ and _drift_ express this meaning also under rather obvious metaphors. _Tenor_ comes from Late Latin _tenorem_, a holding on, and refers to the voice which, in a masculine chorus, carries the air, and hence seems to hold the whole musical composition together. The _tenor_ of a speech is the general theme and meaning, something corresponding to the part of the musical whole which is sustained by the tenor voice. _Drift_ expresses the same idea under a different metaphor. It refers to the movement of a current, which even in moments of deceptive tranquillity, or in a storm which drives the waves before the wind against the current, may be detected by the direction in which floating objects on the surface of the water are _drifting_ or moving. The _drift_ of a speech is the general direction in which its thought seems to be moving, the apparent intention and meaning. 

####tentative 
See [empirical](entry://empirical)

####term 
**TERM, LIMIT, BOUNDARY.**  
_Term_, in Latin _terminus_, from the Greek _τέρμα_, an end, is the point that ends and that to which we direct our steps: _limit_, from the stem of the Latin _limes_, a landmark, is the line which marks. _Boundary_, from Late Latin _bodina_, possibly of Celtic origin, is the obstacle which interrupts our progress and prevents us from passing.  
We are carried either toward or away from the _term;_ we keep either within _limits_ or we overstep them; we contract or extend a _boundary._ The _term_ and the _limit_ belong to the thing; by them it is ended: the _boundary_ is that which is made or conceived by the person _bounding._ The _term_ is the point that terminates; the _limit_ is either a line or point which marks where to stop; the _boundary_ is a line which includes a space and points out the extent beyond which one may not pass. The Straits of Gibraltar was the _term_ of Hercules's voyages: it was said, with more eloquence than truth, that the _limits_ of the Roman Empire were those of the world: the sea, the Alps, and the Pyrenees are the natural _boundaries_ of France.  
So likewise in application to moral objects. We mostly reach the _term_ of our prosperity when we attempt to pass the _limits_ which Providence has assigned to human efforts: human ambition often finds a _boundary_ set to its gratification by circumstances which were the most unlooked for and apparently the least adapted to bring about such important results. We see the _term_ of our evils only in the _term_ of our life: our desires have no _limits;_ their gratification only serves to extend our prospects indefinitely: those only are happy whose fortune is the _boundary_ of their desires.

####territory 
**TERRITORY, DOMINION.**  
Both these terms signify a portion of country under a particular government; but the word _territory_ brings to our minds the land which is included; _dominion_ conveys to our minds the power which is exercised: the _territory_ speaks of that which is in its nature bounded; _dominion_ may be said of that which is boundless. A petty prince has his _territory_, the monarch of a great empire has _dominions._ It is the object of every ruler to guard his _territory_ against the irruptions of an enemy; ambitious monarchs are always aiming to extend their _dominions._

####thankfulness 
**THANKFULNESS, GRATITUDE.**  
_Thankfulness_, or a _fulness_ of _thanks_ (from Anglo-Saxon _thanc_, a thought, hence a pleasant thought, a grateful remembrance), is the outward expression of a _grateful_ feeling. _Gratitude_, from the Latin _gratitude_, is the feeling itself. Our _thankfulness_ is measured by the number of our words; our _gratitude_ is measured by the nature of our actions. A person appears very_ thankful_ at the time who afterward proves very _ungrateful. Thankfulness_ is the beginning of _gratitude: gratitude_ is the completion of _thankfulness._

####theatrical 
**THEATRICAL, DRAMATIC, STAGEY, HISTRIONIC.**  
These words all signify belonging to the stage or the art of the stage, but they differ considerably in their meaning. _Theatrical_, from Latin _theatricus_, Greek _θεατρικός_, a dramatic show, means pertaining to the theatre, that is, exaggerated and artificial in such a way as to create an emotional and sensuous effect. _Theatrical_ is sometimes applied in a derogatory sense to actions or manners which are artificial, but it always adds to the general idea of artificiality that of a deliberate effect, usually an emotional effect. _Dramatic_ comes through Latin from the Greek word _δράμα_, a deed, act, drama, meaning that which is done or acted, from _δράω_, I do, and means pertaining to an action represented on the stage — _i.e._, a _drama. Dramatic_ does not suggest artificiality; it merely indicates that which is emotionally striking and exciting — that in which the normal effect of action and feeling is heightened and emphasized without transcending the bounds of reality. _Theatrical_ implies something falsely _dramatic_, wherein the effect does not arise naturally, but is created simply by a method of presentation. _Stagey_ is a translation of _theatrical_ into ruder and more downright terms. It means resembling the exaggerations of the _stage. Histrionic_, from Latin _histrio_, an actor, has an entirely different meaning. It means pertaining to the art of the actor, and is not used in a derogatory sense. 

####theme 
See TOPIC 

####theory 
**THEORY, SPECULATION.**  
_Theory_, from the Greek _θεωρία_, from _θεάομαι_, to behold, and _speculation_, from the Latin _speculatus_, participle of _speculari_, to behold, based on _specula_, a watch-tower, are both employed to express what is seen with the mind's eye. _Theory_ is the fruit of reflection, it serves the purposes of science; practice will be incomplete when the _theory_ is false; _speculation_ belongs more to the imagination; it has, therefore, less to do with realities; it is that which is rarely to be reduced to practice, and can, therefore, seldomer be brought to the test of experience. Hence it arises that _theory_ is contrasted sometimes with the practice, to designate its insufficiency to render a man complete; and _speculation_ is put for that which is fanciful and unreal; a general who is so only in _theory_ will acquit himself miserably in the field; a religionist who is so only in _speculation_ will make a wretched Christian. 

####there 
See [yonder](entry://yonder)

####therefore 
**THEREFORE, CONSEQUENTLY, ACCORDINGLY.**  
_Therefore_, that is, for this reason, marks a deduction; _consequently_, that is, in _consequence_, marks a _consequence; accordingly_, that is, according to some thing, implies an agreement or adaptation. _Therefore_ is employed particularly in abstract reasoning; _consequently_ is employed either in reasoning or in the narrative style; _accordingly is_ used principally in the narrative style. Young persons are perpetually liable to fall into error through inexperience; they ought, _therefore_, the more willingly to submit themselves to the guidance of those who can direct them: the world is now reduced to a state of little better than moral anarchy; _consequently_ nothing but renewed ideals and good government can bring the people back to the use of their sober senses: every preparation was made, and every precaution was taken; _accordingly_ at the fixed hour they proceeded to the place of destination. 

####thick 
**THICK, DENSE.**  
Between _thick_ (Anglo-Saxon _thicce)_ and _dense_ (Latin _densus)_ there is little other difference than that the latter is employed to express that species of _thickness_ which is philosophically considered as the property of the atmosphere in a certain condition: hence we speak of _thick_ in regard to hard or soft bodies, as a _thick_ board or _thick_ cotton; solid or liquid, as a _thick_ cheese or _thick_ milk: but we use the term _dense_ mostly in regard to the air in its various forms, as a _dense_ air, a _dense_ vapor, a _dense_ cloud, and figuratively a _dense_ population. 

####thievery 
See [kleptomania](entry://kleptomania)

####thin 
**THIN, SLENDER, SLIGHT, SLIM.**  
_Thin_, Anglo-Saxon _thine_, meant originally stretched out. _Slender_, Old French _esclendre_, is allied to Old Low German _slender_, a trailing gown, and is a nasalized form of the stem found in the verb _slide;_ that which is long, trailing, is associated generally with the idea of _slenderness_ in the modern sense. _Slight_ is an Old Low German word meaning originally even or flat, then plain, smooth, simple; then trivial, of no real weight and importance — thence _slight_ in the sense in which it is here used. _Slim_ comes from Dutch; it meant originally oblique, hence weak, poor, bad, thin, slight. In most of these cases the present physical application develops out of a more general application. _Thin_ is the generic term, the rest are specific: _thin_ may be said of that which is small and short, as well as small and long; _slender_ is always said of that which is small and long at the same time: a board is _thin_ which wants solidity or substance: a poplar is _slender_, because its tallness is disproportioned to its magnitude or the dimensions of its circumference. _Thinness_ is sometimes a natural property; _slight_ and _slim_ are applied to that which is artificial: the leaves of trees are of a _thin_ texture; a board may be made _slight_ by continually planing; a paper box is very _slim. Thinness_ is a good property sometimes; _thin_ paper is frequently preferred to that which is thick: _slightness_ and _slimness_, which is a greater degree of _slightness_, are always defects; that which is made _slight_ is unfit to bear the stress that will be put upon it; that which is _slim_ is altogether unfit for the purpose proposed: a carriage that is made _slight is_ quickly broken and always out of repair; paper is altogether too _slim_ to serve the purpose of wood.  
_Thinness_ is a natural property of many bodies, whether solid or fluid; _slender_ and _slight_ have a moral and figurative application. 

####think 
**THINK, REFLECT, PONDER, MUSE.**  
_Think is_ a Teutonic word found in most of the Germanic tongues in some form. _Reflect_, in Latin _reflectere_, signifies literally to bend back, that is, to bend the •mind back on itself. _Ponder_, from _pondus_, a weight, signifies to weigh. For the derivation of _muse_ see [amuse](entry://amuse).  
To _think is_ a general and indefinite term; to _reflect_ is a particular mode of _thinking;_ to _ponder_ and _muse_ are different modes of _reflecting_, the former on grave matters, the latter on matters that interest either the affections or the imagination: we _think_ whenever we receive or recall an idea to the mind; but we _reflect_ only by recalling, not one only, but many ideas: we _think_ if we only suffer the ideas to revolve in succession in the mind; but in _reflecting_ we compare, combine, and judge of those ideas which thus pass in the mind: we _think_, therefore, of things past, as they are pleasurable or otherwise; we _reflect_ upon them as they are applicable to our present condition: we may _think_ on things past, present, or to come; we _reflect, ponder_, and _muse_ mostly on that which is past or present. The man _thinks_ of the days of his childhood and wishes them back; the child _thinks_ of the time when he shall be a man and is impatient until it has come: the man _reflects_ on his past follies and tries to profit by experience; he _ponders_ over any serious concern that affects his destiny, and _muses_ on the happy events of his childhood.  
**THINK, SUPPOSE, IMAGINE, BELIEVE, DEEM.** — To _think_ is here, as in the preceding article, the generic term. It expresses, in common with the other terms, the act of having a particular idea in the mind; but it is indefinite as to the mode and the object of the action. To _think_ may be the act of the understanding or merely of the _imagination:_ to _suppose_ and _imagine_ are rather the acts of the _imagination_ than of the understanding. To _think_, that is, to have any thought or opinion upon a subject, requires reflection; it is the work of time: to _suppose_ and _imagine_ may be the acts of the moment. We _think_ a thing right or wrong; we _suppose_ it to be true or false; we _imagine_ it to be real or unreal. To _think_ is employed promiscuously in regard to all objects, whether actually existing or not, or, if existing, are above our comprehension: to _suppose_ applies to those which are uncertain or precarious; _imagine_, to those which are unreal. _Think_ and _imagine_ are said of that which affects the senses immediately; _suppose_ is said only of that which occupies the mind. We _think_ that we hear a noise as soon as the sound catches our attention; in certain states of the body or mind we _imagine_ we hear noises which were never made: we _think_ that a person will come to-day, because he has informed us that he intends to do so; we _suppose_ that he will come to-day, at a certain hour, because he came at the same hour yesterday.  
In regard to moral points, in which case the word _deem_ may be compared with the others, to _think_ is a conclusion drawn from certain premises. I _think_ that a man has acted wrong: to _suppose_ is to take up an idea arbitrarily or at pleasure; we argue upon a _supposed_ case merely for the sake of argument: to _imagine_ is to take up an idea by accident or without any connection with the truth or reality; we _imagine_ that a person is offended with us, without being able to assign a single reason for the idea; we _imagine_ evils even more numerous than those which are real: to _deem_ is to form a conclusion; things are _deemed_ hurtful or otherwise in consequence of observation.  
To _think_ and _believe_ are both opposed to knowing or perceiving; but _think_ is a more partial action than _believe:_ we _think_ as the thing strikes us at the time; we _believe_ from a settled deduction: hence it expresses much less to say that I _think_ a person speaks the truth than that I _believe_ that he speaks the truth. I _think_ from what I can recollect that such and such were the words, is a vague mode of speech, not admissible in a court of law as positive evidence: the natural question which follows upon this is, Do you firmly _believe_ it? an affirmative answer to which, when made with the appearance of sincerity, must be admitted as testimony. Hence it arises that the word _think_ can be employed only in matters that require but little thought in order to come to a conclusion; and _believe_ is applicable to things that must be admitted only on substantial evidence. We are at liberty to say that I _think_ or I _believe_ that the account is made out right; but we must say that I _believe_, not _think_, that the Bible is the word of God.

####thoughtful 
**THOUGHTFUL, CONSIDERATE, DELIBERATE.**  
_Thoughtful_, or full of _thinking; considerate_, or ready to _consider_ (see [consider](entry://consider)); and _deliberate_, ready to _deliberate_, rise upon one another in their signification: he who is _thoughtful_ does not forget his duty; he who is _considerate_ pauses and _considers_ properly what is his duty; he who _deliberates_ considers _deliberately._ It is a recommendation to a subordinate person to be _thoughtful_ in doing what is wished of him: it is the recommendation of a confidential person to be _considerate_, as he has often to judge according to his own discretion; it is the recommendation of a person who is acting for himself in critical matters to be _deliberate_, from Latin _de_ and _librare_, to weigh. There is this further distinction in the word _deliberate_ that it may be used in the bad sense to mark a settled intention to do evil: young people may sometimes plead in extenuation of their guilt that their misdeeds do not arise from _deliberate_ malice. 

####thoughtless

####thraldom 
**THRALDOM, VASSALAGE.**  
_Thraldom_ refers to the condition of the northern _thrall_ (Icelandic _thrœll)_ or slave, who served in the household and on the land; _vassalage_ to the condition of the feudal _vassal_ or dependent who was bound to render his lord certain military and financial services. _Thraldom_ therefore suggests a more absolute state of servitude, an entire subjection to the will of another, with the implication of something irksome and harassing in the state. _Vassalage_ indicates a partial subjection, a subjection of will and more or less personal dependence.  
See also [servitude](entry://servitude)

####threat 
**THREAT, MENACE.**  
_Threat_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _threát_, a crowd, a pushing, and signifies a method of exerting force by word of mouth. _Menace_ is of Latin extraction. They do not differ in signification; but, as is frequently the case, the Anglo-Saxon is the familiar term and the Latin word is employed only in the higher style. We may be _threatened_ with either small or great evils; but we are _menaced_ only with great evils. One individual _threatens_ to strike another: a general _menaces_ the enemy with an attack. We are _threatened_ by things as well as persons: we are _menaced_ by persons only (or things personified): a person is _threatened_ with a look: he is _menaced_ with a prosecution by bis adversary.

_Thrill_, from Anglo-Saxon _thyrlian_, meant originally to pierce. For the derivations of _stir_ and _vibrate_ see those words. These three terms all indicate a movement in response to some impulse received from without, and are figuratively applied to a psychological state. But the character of the movement differs. _Stir_ is the most general of the three words. It means simply to be set in motion, and refers to any physical or psychological response to a stimulus. _Vibrate_ refers to a regular motion to and fro, or up and down. _Thrill_ indicates a sudden piercing, poignant movement which quickly spends itself. Figuratively applied to psychological states, to _vibrate_ means simply to respond to a stimulus, to move in harmony with it, as a sounding-board may respond to the soundwaves and _vibrate_ accordingly. To _thrill_ indicates more definite but momentary emotion, an electric current of feeling, as it were, suddenly quivering through the whole nervous system.

####tidy 
**TIDY, NEAT, TRIM.**  
These three words contain the same general idea of a combination of orderliness and cleanness, but they differ in the degree and kind of orderliness indicated. _Tidy_, from Middle English _tid_, time, emphasizes the idea of a seasonable, and hence a seemly, order — a _tidy_ room is a room in which everything is picked up and put in its proper place. _Neat_ emphasizes the idea of cleanness added to order. _Trim_ adds to the notion of cleanness and order a suggestion of something more positively pleasing. A _trim_ attire is one in which _neatness_ and _tidiness_ are made positively striking by effective arrangement and emphasis.

####time 
**TIME, SEASON.**  
_Time_ is here the generic term; it is taken either for the whole or the part: _season_ is any given portion of _time._ We speak of _time_ when the simple idea of _time_ only is to be expressed; as the _time_ of the day or the _time_ of the year; the _season_ is spoken of in reference to given circumstances, as the year is divided into four parts, called the _seasons_, according to the nature of the weather: hence in general _time_ is called the _season_ which is suitable for any particular purpose; youth is the _season_ for improvement. It is a matter of necessity to choose the _time;_ it is an affair of wisdom to choose the _season._  
**TIME, PERIOD, AGE, DATE, ERA, EPOCH.** — _Time_ is, as before, taken either for _time_ in general or _time_ in particular; all the other terms are taken for particular portions of _time._ In the sense of a particular portion of _time_, the word _time_ is applied generally and indefinitely.  
_Time_ included within any given points is termed a _period_, from the Greek _περίοδος_, signifying a course, round, or any revolution: thus, the _period_ of day or of night is the space of _time_ comprehended between the rising and setting, or setting and rising, of the sun: the _period_ of a year comprehends the space which, according to astronomers, the earth requires for its annual revolution. So, in an extended and moral application, we have stated _periods_ in our life for particular things: during the _period_ of infancy a child is in a state of total dependence on its parents; a _period_ of apprenticeship has been appointed for youth to learn different trades.  
The _period_ is sometimes taken not only for the space of time included between two points of _time_, but sometimes for the terminating point; in this sense, to put a _period_ to a thing is to terminate its existence, to destroy it.  
The _age_ is the _period_ comprehended within the life of one man, or of numbers living at the same time, and consequently refers to what is done by men living within that _period:_ hence we speak of the different _ages_ that have existed since the commencement of the world, and characterize this or that _age_ by the particular degrees of vice or virtue, genius, and the like, for which it is distinguished.  
The _date_ is properly the point of _time_ which is marked on a writing, either to show the _time_ when it was written, as the _date_ of a letter, or to show when any contract is to be performed, or thing done, as the _date_ of a bill of exchange. As the _date_ in the first case shows when anything has been done, the word _date_ may be applied generally to the time of any past event, as a thing of late _date_ or early _date;_ so of a thing out of _date_, which is so long gone by that the _date_ of it is not known.  
As the _date_ in the second case shows how long it will be before a thing is to be done, as a bill of short _date_ shows that it has but a short time to run, so the term _date_ may be applied to the duration of any event.  
_Era_, in Latin _ara_, probably from _œs_, brass, signifying a brass counter used in computing; and _epoch_, from the Greek _εποχή_, from _επέχειν_, to stop, signifying a resting-place; both refer to points of _time_ that are in some manner marked or distinguished; but the former is more commonly employed in the literal sense for points of computation in chronology, as the Christian _era;_ the latter is indefinitely employed for any _period_ distinguished by remarkable events: the captivity of the Jews is an _epoch_ in the history of that nation. The terms may also be figuratively employed in the latter sense, as an eventful _era._  
**TIMELY, SEASONABLE.** — The same distinction exists between the epithets _timely_ and _seasonable_ as between _time_ and _season_ in the preceding article. The former signifies within the time, that is, before the time is past; the latter according to the season, or what the season requires. A _timely_ notice prevents that which would otherwise happen; a _seasonable_ hint seldom fails of its effect because it is _seasonable._ We must not expect to have a _timely_ notice of death, but must be prepared for it at any time; an admonition to one who is on a sickbed is very _seasonable_ when given by a minister or a friend. The opposites of these terms are _untimely_ or _ill-timed_ and _unseasonable: untimely_ is directly opposed to _timely_, signifying before the time appointed; as an _untimely_ death; but _ill-timed_ is indirectly opposed, signifying in the wrong _time;_ as an _ill-timed_ remark.  
_Time-serving, Temporizing. — Time-serving_ and _temporizing_ are both applied to the conduct of one who adapts himself servilely to the time and season; but a _time-server_ is rather active, and a _temporizer_ passive. A _time-server_ avows those opinions which will serve his purpose: the _temporizer_ forbears to avow those which are likely for the time being to hurt him. The former acts from a desire of gain, the latter from a fear of loss. _Time-servers_ are of all parties, as they come in the way: _temporizers_ are of no party, as occasion requires. Sycophant courtiers must always be _time-servers:_ ministers of state are frequently _temporizers._

####tolerate 
**TOLERATE, ENDURE, SUFFER.**  
_Tolerate_ comes ultimately from Latin _tollere_, to bear; _endure_, from Latin _durus_, firm, lasting; _suffer_, from Latin _sub_, up, and _ferre_, to bear. The words all indicate submission to something unpleasant, but they differ in the kind of submission and the extent of the unpleasantness indicated. _Tolerate_ suggests something annoying borne with » some patience; _endure_, something in the nature of positive suffering borne with courage and fortitude. _Suffer_ may indicate merely the granting of permission, the submission of the will, or it may imply the bearing of positive pain — that is, it may be either a much stronger word than _endure_ or merely a slightly more emphatic form of _tolerate._ In this last sense it is used in the Bible and in other somewhat archaic expressions.

####topsy-turvy 
**TOPSY-TURVY, UPSIDE-DOWN.**  
_Topsy-turvy_, earlier _topsy-tervy_, or _topside-tervy_, where _tervy_ represented a Middle English _terven_, to roll or overturn. _Upside-down_ bears its meaning on its face. _Upside-down_ is a prosaic and literal way of saying what is more humorously suggested in _topsyturvy. Upside-down_ means merely turned so that the upper part is where the lower part ought to be. _Topsyturvy_, while implying the same inversion, adds the idea of general confusion. It is a humorous and colloquial word. 

####torment 
**TORMENT, TORTURE.**  
_Torment_ and _torture_ both come from _torquere._ to twist, and express the agony which arises from a violent twisting or griping of any part; but the latter, which is more immediately derived from the verb, expresses much greater violence and consequent pain than the former. _Torture_ is an excess of _torment._ We may be _tormented_ by a variety of indirect means; but we are said to be _tortured_ mostly by the direct means of the rack or similar instrument. _Torment_ may be permanent: _torture_ is only for a time or on certain occasions. It is related in history that a person was once _tormented_ to death by a violent and incessant beating of drums in his prison: the Indians practiced every species of _torture_ upon their prisoners: whence the application of these terms to moral objects. A guilty conscience may _torment_ a man all his life: the horrors of an awakened conscience are a _torture_ to one who is on his death-bed.

####trade 
**TRADE, COMMERCE, TRAFFIC, DEALING.**  
The old Middle English sense of _trade_ was _path;_ the word is allied to _tread._ It meant the beaten path worn between merchant and customer, hence regular business. _Commerce_ is derived from Latin _cum_, with, and _merx_, merchandise. It refers to an exchange of merchandise between two or more people. _Traffic_ comes through French from Italian _trafficare_, a Low Latin _traficum, trafica_, based perhaps on _trans_ and a hypothetical verb _vicare, vicis_, or "change across. " To engage in exchange or _trade._  
The leading idea in _trade_ is that of carrying on business for purposes of gain; the rest are but modes of _trade; commerce_ is a mode of _trade_ by exchange: _traffic_ is a sort of personal _trade_, a sending from hand to hand; _dealing_ is a bargaining or calculating kind of _trade. Trade_ is either on a large or small scale, _commerce_ is always on a large scale; we may _trade_ retail or wholesale; we always carry on _commerce_ by wholesale: _trade_ is either within or without the country; _commerce_ is always between different countries: there may be a _trade_ between two towns; but there is a _commerce_ between England and America, between France and Italy: hence it arises that the general term _trade_ is of inferior import when compared with _commerce._ The _commerce_ of a country, in the abstract and general sense, conveys more to our mind, and is a more noble expression, than the _trade_ of the country, as the merchant ranks higher than the _tradesman_, and a _commercial_ house than a _trading_ concern. _Trade_ may be altogether domestic and between neighbors; the _traffic_ is that which goes backward and forward between any two or more points: in this manner there may be a great _traffic_ between two towns or cities, as between London and the capitals of the different counties; we also speak of busy thoroughfares of a city as full of _traffic. Trade_ may consist simply in buying and selling according to a stated valuation; _dealings_ are carried on in matters that admit of a variation: hence we speak of _dealers_ in wool, in corn, seeds, and the like, who buy up portions of these goods, more or less, according to the state of the market.  
_Trade_, however, in its most extended sense, comprehends all the rest.

####tramontane 
**TRAMONTANE, ULTRAMONTANE.**  
_Tramontane_, in French _tramontain_, northerly, from Italian _tramontano_, that from Late Latin _transmontanus, across_ or _beyond_ the mountains, is both an adjective and a substantive. As an adjective it implies lying north or being _beyond_ the mountains, that is, the Alps, as the Italians originally applied the term, hence _foreign._ Subsequently the term was applied by the French to the Italians, as being south, _beyond_, or on the other side of the mountains. In the latter application the term takes the form of _ultramontane_, from Latin _ultra_, beyond, and _montanus_, a mountain.  
As a substantive _tramontane_, as well as _ultramontane_, signifies one living or coming _across_ or from _beyond_ or from the other side of the mountains, hence a stranger, one of _foreign_ habitation.  
_Tramontane_ also implies the north wind _(tramontana)_ in the Mediterranean, and a peculiar blighting wind, very harmful in the Archipelago: and _ultramontane_, in church history, the name given in the Vatican Council (1870) to the opinion of the church that the Papal utterances _ex cathedra_ on matters of faith and morals are irrevocable.

####transfer 
**TRANSFER, TRANSMIT.**  
These words both signify to remove from one place to another, but there is a slight difference in meaning corresponding to the difference in derivation. _Transfer_ comes from Latin _trans_, across, and _ferre_, to carry, and signifies to carry across an intervening space. _Transmit_ comes from Latin _trans_, across, and _mittere_, to send, and signifies to send across. We use _transfer_ wherever the idea of actually bearing or carrying is prominent. We speak of _transmitting_ messages by telegraph; of _transferring_ goods by freight. 

####transfigure 
**TRANSFIGURE, TRANSFORM, METAMORPHOSE.**  
_Transfigure_ is to make to pass over into another figure: _transform_ and _metamorphose_ (from Greek _μετά_ and _μορφόω_, or I change about) are to put into another form, the first being said only of spiritual beings, and particularly in reference to our Saviour; the other two terms being applied to that which has a corporeal form.  
_Transformation_ is commonly applied to that which changes its outward form; in this manner a harlequin _transforms_ himself into all kinds of shapes and likenesses. _Metamorphosis_ is applied to the form internal as well as external, that is, to the whole nature; in this manner Ovid describes, among others, the _metamorphoses_ of Narcissus into a flower and Daphne into a laurel: with the same idea we may speak of a rustic being _metamorphosed_, by the force of art, into a fine gentleman.

####transpire 
**TRANSPIRE, EXHALE, LEAK OUT.**  
_Transpire_ originally meant to be sent off as vapor, to be breathed out, from Latin _trans_, through, and _spirare_, to breathe. It is a synonyme of _exhale_ (from Latin _ex_, out, and _halare_, to breathe) when used literally, and a synonyme of _leak out_, used figuratively. It is not a synonyme of _happen_ or _occur_, though vulgarly employed as such. We speak of a secret _transpiring_, meaning that it is breathed out, becomes known. _Exhale_ has the same literal meaning, but not the same figurative application. _Leak out_ has a similar figurative application, but the metaphor is not that of vapor _exhaled_, but of water, or other liquid, dripping out.

####travesty 
**TRAVESTY, BURLESQUE, CARICATURE, PARODY.**  
_Travesty_, in French _travesti_, past participle of _travestir_, to disguise one's self, from the Latin _trans_, across, over, implying a change, and _vestire_, to clothe, signifies that which has a changed or unusual attire, disguised in garments so as to present a ridiculous appearance. As a substantive it signifies that which has been changed, transformed, from a lofty, serious style into a ridiculous, ludicrous one.  
_Burlesque_, as an adjective, signifies the exciting to laughter by an extravagant contrast; as a substantive, a ludicrous, grotesque representation; as a verb, to ridicule or make ridiculous by a humorous, fantastic, sarcastic change in an original. _Caricature_, as a substantive, comes through Italian from Latin _carricare_, to load a car, hence to overweight, to "lay on thick, " to _caricature._ It signifies a figure or description of a person or thing in which defects are greatly exaggerated in order to give the subject a ridiculous appearance, a representation in which the salient features of the original are changed to the extent of producing a ludicrous effect, without entirely, or even essentially, destroying the resemblance.  
Though _travesty_ and _parody_ have a general relationship they differ in application. _Parody_ changes the subject-matter in hand and the personalities, and mockingly imitates the style of the original, as Richelieu's parody of Corneille's _Cid; travesty_ leaves the subject matter partially, and the personalities wholly, unaltered, producing its intended effect by substituting the grotesque in action or speech for the serious, noble, or heroic.  
For further critical distinctions between the meaning and derivations of these words see [caricature](entry://caricature). 

####treacherous 
**TREACHEROUS, TRAITOROUS, TREASONABLE.**  
These epithets are all applied to one who betrays his trust, _treacherous_, from Middle High German _trechen_, to draw, entice, and _traitorous_, from Latin _traditorem_, a traitor, based on _tradere_, to give up; but _treacherous_ (see **faithless** under [faith](entry://faith)) connotes a man's private relations; _traitorous_, his public relation to his ruler and his country: he is a _treacherous_ friend and a _traitorous_ subject. We may be _treacherous_ to our enemies as well as our friends, for nothing can lessen the obligation to be faithful in keeping a promise; we may be _traitorous_ to our country by abstaining to lend that aid which is in our power. _Traitorous_ and _treasonable_ are both applicable to subjects: but the former is extended to all public acts; the latter only to those which affect the supreme power: a soldier is _traitorous_ who goes over to the side of the enemy against his country; a man is guilty of _treasonable_ practices who meditates taking the life of the king or aims at subverting his government: a man may be a _traitor_ and be guilty of _treason_ under all forms of government.

####treasure 
**TREASURE, HOARD.**  
The idea of laying up carefully is common to these verbs; but to _treasure_ is to lay up for the sake of preserving; to _hoard_, to lay up for the sake of accumulating; we _treasure_ the gifts of a friend; the miser _hoards_ up his money: we attach a real value to that which we _treasure_, a fictitious value to that which is _hoarded._ To _treasure_ is used either in the proper or improper sense; we _treasure_ a book on which we set particular value or we _treasure_, the words or actions of another in our recollection; the miser _hoards_ up whatever he can scrape together.

####trembling 
**TREMBLING, TREMOR, TREPIDATION.**  
The first two of these terms are derived from the same source (see [agitation](entry://agitation)), and designate a general state of agitation: _trembling is_ not only the most familiar, but also the most indefinite, term of the three; _trepidation_ (from Latin _trepidare)_ and _tremor_ are species of _trembling. Trembling_ expresses any degree of involuntary shaking of the frame, from the affection cither of the body or the mind; cold, nervous affections, fear, and the like are the ordinary causes of _trembling: tremor_ is a slight degree of _trembling_, which arises mostly from a mental affection; when one is agitated one's mind is thrown into a _tremor_ by any trifling incident: _trepidation_ is more violent than cither of the two, and springs from the defective state of the mind; it shows itself in the action, or the different movements, of the body, rather than in the body; those who have not the requisite composure of mind to command themselves on all occasions are apt to do what is required of them with _trepidation. Trembling_ and _tremulous_ are applied as epithets, either to persons or things; a _trembling_ voice evinces _trepidation_ of mind, a _tremulous_ voice evinces a _tremor_ of mind: notes in music are sometimes _trembling;_ the motion of the leaves of trees is _tremulous._

####trench 
**TRENCH, CHANNEL, DITCH, FURROW.**  
These words all indicate a passage cut in the ground. _Furrow_ is the passage made by a plough in the field for the receiving of the seed. A _trench_ is a deeper and wider passage cut in the ground and thoroughly excavated; it now refers particularly to the protective fortifications developed underground by both sides in the European war. A _ditch_ is a small _trench_ into which water is drained and carried off. A _channel_ serves the same purpose as a _ditch_, but usually refers to a natural passageway made by the action of a stream or is figuratively extended to refer to something resembling such a natural passage, as when we speak of _channels_ of trade, _channels_ of intercourse, etc. 

####trenchant 
**TRENCHANT, SHARP.**  
_Trenchant_, from French _trencher_, to cut (Latin _truncare)_, to cut down the _trunk_ of a tree, means _sharp_, but implies a positive action of the sharp instrument on something. It is now used mainly in the figurative sense, whereas _sharp_ has a literal as well as a figurative significance. A _sharp_ speech is that which hurts or cuts like the blade of a knife; a _trenchant_ criticism is that which suggests a _sharp_ instrument wielded by an energetic hand. There is more action and deliberate purpose in _trenchant_ than in _sharp._

####tribunal 
**TRIBUNAL, BAR, BENCH, COURT, JUDGMENT-SEAT. **  
_Tribunal_ is a substantive, derived from Latin _tribunal_, based on _tribunus._ The term implies a place for making decisions, a high or principal resort for litigants, consistently with its Latin prototype, which meant a raised platform on which the seats of the _tribunes_, or magistrates, were placed.  
In ordinary language the _bar_ in a court-room applies to the railing which separates the space for spectators from the part reserved for the judge, jury, lawyers, court officers, and witnesses when testifying. A law student is _called to the bar_ when he is summoned to this railing to be sworn as a practitioner, and after the ceremony he is _admitted to the bar_ and permitted to take a place _within the bar._  
The _bench_, or, figuratively, the _judgment-seat_, is the seat of a judge, singly or with associates, when discharging judicial duties. Collectively judges and lawyers are spoken of as _the bench and bar._  
The _bar, bench_, and _court_, the latter applying to the judge, the Judicial department, and the place of adjudication, have varied jurisdictions, according to the special purpose of a _court._ The _bar and bench_ remain the lawyers and judges in all cases, but the _court_, as the judicial department of government, is generally divided into several parts, each having authority to deal with specific cases, and all ranging from trial to appeal.  
The term _tribunal_ has received a very broad application in recent years by its extension to the adjudication of international disputes, etc., the highest type of which is what is known officially as the Permanent Court of Arbitration of The Hague, and popularly as The Hague Tribunal.

####trice 
**TRICE, JIFFY.**  
_Trice_ is a Scandinavian word, but the phrase _in a trice_ is imitated from Spanish _en un tris, iris_, an imitative word meaning here the cracking of glass — the phrase therefore signifying in the time that it takes to smash something. _Jiffy_ is a somewhat colloquial word of unknown origin. There is little difference in the meaning of the two words. Both signify "in the least possible time"; but _jiffy_ is a familiar and half-humorous term. _Trice_ is more suitable in dignified writing.

####trifling 
**TRIFLING, TRIVIAL, PETTY, FRIVOLOUS, FUTILE.**  
_Trifling_ comes from Old French _truffle_, signifying a thing of small worth. _Trivial_ is derived from Latin _trivium_, from _tres_, three, and _via_, way, a place where three roads met, signifying that which can be picked up on the most frequented part of the common highway; hence, worthless, of no account. _Petty_ comes from French _petit_, small — a Celtic word. _Frivolous_ is derived from Latin _frivola_, broken potsherds, and goes back ultimately to _fricare_, to rub away. _Futile_ contains the same root as Latin _fundere_, to pour, and signifies that which is poured out as worthless.  
All these epithets characterize an object as of little or no value: _trifling_ and _trivial_ differ only in degree, the latter denoting a still lower degree of value than the former. What is _trifling_ or _trivial_ is that which does not require any consideration and may be easily passed over as forgotten: _trifling_ objections can never weigh against solid reason; _trivial_ remarks only expose the shallowness of the remarkers; what is _petty_ is beneath our consideration, it ought to be disregarded and held cheap; it would be a _petty_ consideration for a minister of state to look to the small savings of a private family: what is _frivolous_ and _futile_ is disgraceful for any one to consider; the former in relation to all the objects of our pursuit or attachment, the latter only in regard to matters of reasoning; dress is a _frivolous_ occupation when it forms the chief business of a rational being; the objections of anarchists against orderly government are as _futile_ as they are mischievous.

####trite 
**TRITE, BANAL, HACKNEYED.**  
All these words signify that which through familiarity has bred contempt. _Trite_ comes from Latin _tritus_, the past participle of _terere_, to rub or grind. It refers to something out of which all possible interest or meaning has been rubbed or ground. A _trite_ remark is that which has been made many times. _Hackneyed_ comes through French from an uncertain source; perhaps from Dutch _hacken_, to chop, and _negge_, a nag, with the implication of jolting. A _hackney_ was originally a horse used for every-day riding, as opposed to a war-horse; _hackney_ then came to signify a hired equipage (whence _hack_ is derived), and through that something common. _Banal_ is derived from Late Latin _bannum_, from a Germanic root _bannan_, to summon. It referred originally to the service demanded of all feudal vassals, and, through the idea of something common to all, developed the meaning of _commonplace._ Of these three words _hackneyed_ expresses most distinctly the idea of worn out by usage. A _hackneyed_ quotation, for example, may be an excellent quotation in itself, but it has been used so often that it has lost its significance. _Trite_ conveys the same meaning, but does it less clearly and distinctly. However, it adds to the suggestion of constant use a general implication that the whole substance of the thing denominated _trite_ is stale and uninteresting. A _hackneyed_ remark is one which has been made before; a _trite_ remark may not have been made before in exactly the same form, but it conveys an idea which has lost its force through familiarity. _Banal_ emphasizes the idea of staleness, obviousness, still further, and departs more widely from the simple idea of _hackneyed. Banal_ means "what any ordinary person might think of" — implying not repetition so much as an utter lack of originality in the first place. 

####triumph 
**TRIUMPH, CONQUEST, EXULTATION, SUCCESS, VICTORY.**  
_Triumph_, in old French _triumphe_, French _triomphe_, from Latin _triumphum_, accusative of _triumphus_, cognate with Greek _θρίαμβος_, a hymn to Βacchus, Spanish _triunfo_, Portuguese _triumfo_, Italian _trionfo_, implied originally a grand procession in which a victorious general entered Rome by the Porta Triumphalis, in a chariot drawn by four horses, wearing an embroidered robe, an undergarment decorated with palm leaves, and a wreath of laurel round his forehead.  
As a substantive, in ordinary language, the term signifies a display of pomp of any kind; a public festivity, tournament, pageant, unusual celebration; the expression of joy, great gladness, _exultation_ for some noteworthy _success._ As a verb, it signifies to win a _conquest_, prevail over an adversary, achieve a decisive advantage in battle or other encounter, to subdue opposition, to accomplish a _victory._  
In a reprehensible sense it signifies to boast, brag, chuckle, exult on an advantage gained over another or believed to be gained, to "crow" insolently over the discomfiture of another. 

####troop 
**TROOP, COMPANY.**  
In a military sense, a _troop_ is among the horse what a _company_ is among the foot; but this is only a partial acceptation of the terms. _Troop_, in French _troupe_, immediately from Low Latin _troppus_, may be a metathesized form of English _thorp_; cf. Icelandic _thorp_, German _dorf;_ it signifies an indiscriminate multitude; _company_ (see [accompany](entry://accompany)) is any number joined together and bearing one another _company:_ hence we speak of a _troop_ of hunters, a _company_ of players; a _troop_ of horsemen, a _company_ of travellers. 

####trouble 
**TROUBLE, DISTURB, MOLEST.**  
Whatever uneasiness or painful sentiment is produced in the mind by outward circumstances is effected either by _trouble_ (see **affliction** under [afflict](entry://afflict)), by _disturbance_ (see [commotion](entry://commotion)), or by _molestation_ (see [inconvenience](entry://inconvenience)). _Trouble_ is the most general in its application; we may be _troubled_ by the want of a thing or _troubled_ by that which is unsuitable; we are _disturbed_ and _molested_ only by that which actively _troubles._ Pecuniary wants are the greatest _troubles_ in life, the perverseness of servants, the indisposition or ill behavior of children, are domestic _troubles:_ but the noise of children is a _disturbance_, and the prospect of want _disturbs_ the mind. _Trouble_ may be permanent; _disturbance_ and _molestation_ are temporary, and both refer to the peace which is destroyed; a _disturbance_ ruffles or throws out of a tranquil state, a _molestation_ burdens or bears hard either on the body or the mind: noise is always a _disturbance_ to one who wishes to think or to remain in quiet; talking, or any noise, is a _molestation_ to one who is in an irritable frame of body or mind.  
**TROUBLESOME, IRKSOME, VEXATIOUS.** — These epithets are applied to the objects which create _trouble_ or _vexation. Troublesome_ is here, as before, the generic term; _irksome_ and _vexatious_ are species of the _troublesome:_ what is _troublesome_ creates either bodily or mental pain; what is _irksome_ creates a mixture of bodily and mental pain; and what is _vexatious_ creates purely mental pain. What requires great exertion, or a too long-continued exertion or exertions, coupled with difficulties, is _troublesome:_ in this sense the laying in stores for the winter is a _troublesome_ work for the ants, and compiling a dictionary is a _troublesome_ labor to the compiler: what requires any exertion which we are unwilling to make, or interrupts the peace which we particularly long for, is _irksome;_ in this sense giving and receiving of visits is _irksome_ to some persons; travelling is _irksome_ to others: what comes across our particular wishes, or disappoints us in a particular manner, is _vexatious;_ in this sense the loss of a prize which we had hoped to gain may be _vexatious._

####truant 
**TRUANT, TRAMP, VAGRANT, VAGABOND.**  
_Truant_ means one who wilfully absents himself from his duties or his usual place — a wanderer out of the beaten track, with the suggestion of idleness and irresponsibility. A _vagrant_ (from Old French _walcrer_, to wander about, Old High German _walchan_ (cf. English _walk)_, probably influenced by French _vagant_, wandering, based on Latin _vagari_, to wander) is a wanderer; _vagabond_ comes from the same Latin word, but adds to the idea of wandering that of shiftlessness, uselessness, irresponsibility. A _tramp_, from the verb _tramp_, is one that _tramps_ through the country begging from house to house. All these words have therefore in common the idea of _wandering_ with the implication of idleness and irresponsibility. 

####truce 
**TRUCE, ARMISTICE.**  
_Truce_ comes through Middle English _trews_, a plural form, from Anglo-Saxon _treowa_, a compact; cf. Anglo-Saxon _treowe_, Modern English _true._ It means a cessation of hostilities on both sides accompanied by a pledge to refrain from attack until further notice. The implication of _true_ comes from this mutual pledge. _Armistice_ is derived from Latin _arma_, arms, and _-stitum_, the form assumed in composition by _statum_, past participle of _sistere_, a secondary form of _stare_, to stand. It means a suspension of arms by mutual agreement. In ordinary usage there is really no difference between _armistice_ and _truce. Truce_ indicates perhaps an _armistice_ of some duration. It is the more simple and practical of the two words, and has therefore a wider figurative application.

**TRY, TEMPT.**  
To _try_ (see also ATTEMPT) is a particular species of trial: we _try_ either ourselves or others; we _tempt_ others: we _try_ a person only in the path of his duty; but we may _tempt_ him to depart from his duty: it is necessary to _try_ the fidelity of a servant before you place confidence in him; it is wicked to _tempt_ any one to do that which we should think wrong to do ourselves; our strength is _tried_ by frequent experiments; we are _tempted_, by the weakness of our principles, to give way to the violence of our passions.

####tumid

####tumultuous 
**TUMULTUOUS, TUMULTUARY.**  
_Tumultuous_ signifies having tumult; _tumultuary_ (a word but rarely used today), disposed for tumult: the former is applied to objects in general, the latter to persons only: in _tumultuous_ meetings the voice of reason is the last thing that is heard; it is the natural tendency of large and promiscuous assemblies to become _tumultuary._  
**TUMULTUOUS, TURBULENT, SEDITIOUS, MUTINOUS.** — _Tumultuous_ (see [bustle](entry://bustle)) describes the disposition to make a noise; those who attend the playhouses, particularly the lower orders, are frequently _tumultuous: turbulent_ marks a hostile spirit of resistance to authority; when prisoners are dissatisfied they are frequently _turbulent: seditious_ marks a spirit of resistance to government; in republics the people are often disposed to be _seditious: mutinous_ marks a spirit of resistance against officers either in the army or navy; a general will not fail to quell the first risings of a _mutinous_ spirit. Electioneering mobs are always _tumultuous;_ the young and the ignorant are so averse to control that they are easily led by the example of an individual to be _turbulent;_ among the Romans the people were in the habit of holding _seditious_ meetings, and sometimes the soldiery would be _mutinous._

####turgid 
**TURGID, TUMID, BOMBASTIC.**  
_Turgid_ and _tumid_ both signify swollen (from Latin _turgere_ and _tumere_, both meaning to swell), but they differ in their application: _turgid_ is most commonly applied to what swells by a physical process, as a _turgid_ vessel; _tumid_ is said of that which seems to swell in an unnatural or unusual manner, as the _tumid_ waves. They are both applied to words. _Bombastic_, from _bombast_, a kind of cotton, signifying puffed up like cotton, is, figuratively, applicable to words only; but the _bombastic_ includes the sentiments expressed; _turgidity_ is confined mostly to the mode of expression. A writer is _turgid_ who expresses a simple thought in lofty language: a person is _bombastic_ who deals in large words and introduces high sentiments in common discourse.  
_Tumid_ is rarely applied to the style. 

####turn 
**TURN, BEND, TWIST, DISTORT, WRING, WREST, WRENCH.**  
_Turn_ comes from Latin _tornare_, to turn a lathe, Greek _τόρνος_, a lathe. _Bend_ (see that word). _Twist_, Anglo-Saxon _twist_, signified originally a rope of double thread, from root found in _twice_, and hence as a verb it signifies the motion involved in winding one thread about another. _Distort_, in Latin _distortus_, participle of _distorquere_, compounded of _dis_, apart, and _torquere_, to turn, signifies to turn violently aside.  
To _turn_ signifies in general to put a thing out of its place in an uneven line; to _bend_, and the rest, are species of _turning:_ we _turn_ a thing by moving it from one point to another; thus we _turn_ the earth over: to _bend_ is simply to change its direction; thus a stick is _bent_ or a body may _bend_ its direction to a certain point: to _twist_ is to _bend_ many times, to make many _turns:_ to _distort_ is to _turn_ or _bend_ out of the right course; thus the face is _distorted_ in convulsions. To _wring_ is to _twist_ with violence; thus linen which has been wet is _wrung:_ to _wrest_ or _wrench_ is to separate from a body by means of _twisting;_ thus a stick may be _wrested_ out of the hand or a hinge _wrenched_ off the door.  
The same distinction holds good in the figurative or moral application: we _turn_ a person from his design; we _bend_ the will of a person; we _twist_ the meaning of words to suit our purposes; we _distort_ them so as to give them an entirely false meaning; we _wring_ a confession from one.  
**TURN, BENT.** — These words are compared here only in the figurative application, as respects the state of a person's inclination: _turn_ is, therefore, as before, indefinite as to the degree; it is the first rising inclination: _bent_ is a positively strong _turn_, a confirmed inclination; a child may early discover a _turn_ for music or drawing; but the real _lent_ of his genius is not until he has made progress in his education and has had an opportunity of trying different things: it may be very well to indulge the _turn_ of mind; it is of great importance to follow the _bent_ of the mind as far as respects arts and sciences.  
**TURN, WIND, WHIRL, TWIRL, WRITHE.** — To _turn_ (see above) is, as before, the generic term; the rest are but modes of _turning; wind_ is to _turn_ a thing round in a regular manner; _whirl_, to _turn_ it round in a violent manner; _twirl_, to turn it round in any irregular and unmeaning way; _writhe_, to turn round in convolution within itself. A worm seldom moves in a straight line; it is, therefore, always _turning:_ sometimes it lies, and sometimes it _writhes_ in agony: a wheel is _whirled_ round by the force of gunpowder: a top is _twirled_ by a child in play. 

####turret 
**TURRET, MINARET, PINNACLE, TOWER.**  
_Turret_, in old French _tourette_, diminutive of French _tour_, a tower, Latin _turris_, a tower, implied, in ancient warfare, a movable structure of wood for carrying soldiers, implements, supplies, etc., that could be rolled on its wheels to an advantageous position for attacking a fortified place, a contrivance suggestive of the wooden horse of Troy.  
A _minaret_ (Spanish _minarete_, from Arabian _manárat_, a candlestick, lamp, lighthouse) is a tall, slender _turret_ or tower attached to a mosque and surrounded with balconies from which the muezzin calls the people to prayer. In Tudor architecture a _turret_ is a small tower attached to another tower or erected at the angles of a church or public building. A _pinnacle_ (Latin _pinnaculum_, a double diminutive of _pinna_, a wing) is a small polygonal _turret_ rising above the rest of a building and forming its highest point.  
In modern and most common usage the term _turret_ applies to a rotating cylindrical steel tower rising above the deck of a warship and bearing guns that can be trained to discharge in any required direction. The first vessel constructed with such a _turret_ was Captain John Ericsson's _Monitor_, described by the Confederates as "a cheese-box on a raft, " which was hastily built for the Federal navy in the early part of the American Civil War. This had a single _turret_, mounting two guns. The later development of the warship into the battleship, and then the dreadnaught and the superdreadnaught, has called for twin _turrets_ on some vessels and a second set superimposed on the first or others. 

####twaddle 
**TWADDLE, BALDERDASH.**  
_Twaddle_ and _balderdash_ have practically the same meaning. They differ only in their original derivation and in the general effect created by the form and sound of the word. _Twaddle_ is an imitative word, a variation of _tattle_, a frequentative signifying to say "Ta, ta, ta. " _Balderdash_ is a Scandinavian word which originally signified a jumbled mixture of liquids. _Twaddle_ more distinctly suggests the act of talking; _balderdash_, the nonsensical character of the talk. 

####twain

####tweedle 
**TWEEDLE, ALLURE, COAX, DECOY, ENTICE.**  
_Tweedle_ is a term of unproved etymology, but is believed to be allied with _twaddle_ (see that word) or _twiddle_, signifying, in music, to touch lightly, to play, as on a violin, with a tremulous, quivering motion, also to busy one's self with trifles. _Tweedle_ is closely allied with _wheedle_, both terms as verbs signifying to _allure_, to tempt by the offer of something good, real, or apparent, to _coax_ or cajole one to do or give something against his first impulse, to flatter in order to gain a point; to _decoy_, to lead or _allure_ or to practice deception to gain an end, and to _entice_ or attract with soft words with the intent of getting what might otherwise be unattainable, to _wheedle out_ of a person that which one wishes to get or know.  
A very familiar use of the term _tweedle_ is in connection with the term _tweedledum_ in the phrase _tweedledum and tweedledee_, implying a distinction without a difference, an attempt to distinguish things or parts where no difference actually exists. This expression is said to have arisen in the eighteenth century, when a controversy occurred between _the_ admirers of Bononcini and those of Handel concerning the merits of those musicians. The controversy reached such a wide and animated state that John Byrom (1691-1763) alluded to it as follows: "Some say, compared to Bononcini, That Mynheer Handel's but a ninny; Others aver that he to Handel Is scarcely fit to hold a candle. Strange all this difference should be 'Twixt _tweedledum_ and _tweedledee. "_

####twit 
**TWIT, GIBE, TAUNT.**  
_Twit_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _œtwitan_, to point to, to reproach. It means to annoy by reminding of something discreditable or assumed to be discreditable. To _gibe_, allied to the Swedish dialectical word _gipa_, to gape, to talk foolishly or rashly, means to speak in a sneering or sarcastic manner. _Taunt_ (see [tease](entry://tease)) is an exaggerated form of _twitting_ — something positively malicious, not merely teasing. _Twitting_ is a particular form of _gibing_ — a more specific word.

####tyro 
**TYRO, AMATEUR, NEOPHYTE, NOVICE.**  
_Tyro_, properly _tiro_, in Latin in similar form, Italian _tirone_, French _tiron_, perhaps from Greek _τέρην_, delicate, soft, signifies a _beginner_ in learning, a _learner_ of the first rudiments, one having only an imperfect or slight knowledge, a mere smattering of a subject, an apprentice to a trade. A _neophyte_, through Latin from Greek _νεόφυτος_, newly planted, is a recent convert, one recently baptized, or one newly admitted to the order of the priesthood, a term sometimes used by Roman Catholic missionaries to designate their converts in non-Christian lands.  
A _novice_, from Latin _novitius_, a derivative of _novus_, new, in ordinary language, is one who is new to any business, profession, art, or vocation, one who is as yet unskilled, just at the bottom of the ladder. In ecclesiastical usage the term signifies the title given to men or women who have entered a religious house and desire to embrace its rules, and in this sense it is synonymous with _postulant_, specifically one who asks, demands, or requests, a French substantive from Latin _postulo_, to demand, Spanish and Italian _postulante_. 

####ubiquitous 
**UBIQUITOUS, EVERYWHERE, OMNIPRESENT, UNIVERSAL.**  
_Ubiquitous_, from Latin _ubique_, everywhere, is simply the Latin corresponding to the native English _everywhere_, used as an adjective. It differs from _everywhere_ in being distinctly an "educated" word, one found only in the vocabulary of the educated. _Omnipresent_ differs from _ubiquitous_ in meaning not merely everywhere, but present everywhere at the same time, _Omnipresence_ is one of the attributes of God. _Universal_ is a more general word which may be limited to correspond to _everywhere;_ it means _everywhere_ throughout the whole scheme of things. 

####ugly 
**UGLY, HOMELY, HIDEOUS, UNSIGHTLY.**  
_Ugly_, from Anglo-Saxon _oga_, fear, from the Teutonic root _agh_, which also appears in the English word _awe_ (Gothic _agis_, Icelandic _agi)_, and _ly_, like, signifies that which is hateful, and hence the opposite of beautiful. _Homely_ meant originally _homelike_, that which belongs to the home. It came to signify that which is contrasted with the splendor and beauty of social life outside of the home — that which is not regarded outside of the circle of the hearth. It indicates the opposite of beautiful, but not a positive degree of unpleasantness. To be _homely_ is to be only mildly _ugly_ or merely not beautiful; it does not suggest the presence of something really disagreeable as does _ugly. Unsightly_ and _hideous_ characterize that which is _ugly_ by the psychological reaction to it. _Unsightly_ means not fit for the sight, something from which we turn away our eyes. _Hideous_, through French _hideux_, a development of Old French _hisdos_, from Latin _hispidosus_, rough, bristly, meant originally something fearful, revolting — the superlative degree of ugliness characterized by its effect upon the onlooker. It is therefore the strongest of these words, as _homely_ is the mildest. 

####ultimate 
See [last](entry://last)

####ultimatum 
**ULTIMATUM, FINAL WORD, LAST TERMS.**  
_Ultimatum_, in Latin the neuter singular of _ultimatus_, the past participle of _ultimare_, signifies, literally, to be the last, to come to an end, and, in ordinary language, the last word. The term is used in connection with many actions, but its strongest application is to diplomatic negotiations, in which it has the dual sense of a declaration and a demand. In an international controversy the term implies directly the most favorable terms which a negotiator is prepared or willing to offer, the rejection of which will be considered as putting an end to negotiation and placing upon the second party the responsibility for whatever consequences may follow. In critical cases an _ultimatum_ implies the _last terms_ or conditions that will be offered, the _final word_, the extreme end in a controversy, and a direct or suggestive threat that if rejected resort will be had to redressive measures, but, apart from these rather lame attempts at periphrasis, it really has no synonymes.  
The _ultimatum_ was frequently employed in the great European war. Just prior to the outbreak Austria sent an _ultimatum_ to Serbia regarding the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife; and later Japan sent one to Germany, Russia one to Bulgaria, and, it was believed that both the Entente and the Central Powers had sent one to Greece for the purpose of winning her active cooperation in the war. The United States had frequent occasion to send messages to the belligerents, but these were known officially as _protests_, though they contained the essence of an _ultimatum_, as they pointed out the possibility of a severance of friendly relations if unheeded.  
The "note" to Austria-Hungary, under date of December 12, 1915, concerning the sinking of the steamship _Ancona_ by a submarine flying the Austro-Hungarian flag, with the loss of many American lives, was more of the character of an _ultimatum_, for it demanded that "the Imperial and Royal Government denounce the sinking of the _Ancona_ as an illegal and indefensible act, that the officer who perpetrated the deed be punished, and that reparation by the payment of an indemnity be made for the citizens of the United States who were killed or injured by the attack on the vessel. " The "note" further expressed the expectation that the Austro-Hungarian Government would "accede to its demand promptly. " 

####ultramontane 
See [tramontane](entry://tramontane)

####umbrage 
**UMBRAGE, PIQUE.**  
_Umbrage_ comes from Latin _umbra_, a shade. _Pique_ comes through French from the Teutonic word found in _pick_, meaning a prick, the sensation produced by the contact with a sharp point. Both words are used now in a figurative sense to indicate a slight and momentary feeling or expression of vexation or jealous annoyance. _Umbrage_, in the phrase, to take _umbrage_, indicates the more positive feeling of the two — a shadowing, as it were, of anger and jealousy. _Pique_ indicates a slighter and more frivolous feeling, a temporary pang of jealousy that is not strong enough to become a real and effective emotion. Neither of them indicate serious or permanent states of feeling. 

####umbrella 
**UMBRELLA, PARASOL.**  
_Umbrella_ comes from Latin _umbra_, and is a diminutive form, meaning a little shadow. It indicates a screen, composed of a kind of canopy held over the head by a handle, to ward off the rain. _Parasol_, borrowed through French from Portuguese, and compounded of _parar_, to ward off (English _parry)_, and _sol_, sun, means a similar screen of lighter and gayer material carried to protect the bearer from the sun.

####unbelief 
**UNBELIEF, INFIDELITY, INCREDULITY.**  
_Unbelief_ (see [belief](entry://belief)) concerns matters in general; _infidelity_ (see **faithful** under [faith](entry://faith)) is _unbelief_ as respects Divine revelation; _incredulity_ is _unbelief_ in ordinary matters. _Unbelief_ is taken in an indefinite and negative sense; it is the want of _belief_ in any particular thing that may or may not be _believed._ The term _unbelief_ does not of itself convey any reproachful meaning; it signifies properly a general disposition not to _believe._  
We may be _unbelievers_ in indifferent as well as the most important matters, but the term _unbeliever_ taken absolutely means one who disbelieves religious dogmas.  
_Infidelity_ is a more active state of mind; it supposes a violent and total rejection of that which is commonly _believed: incredulity_ is also an active state of mind, in which we refuse _belief_ in matters that may or may not be rejected. The Jews are _unbelievers_ in the mission of our Saviour; the Turks, from the Christian point of view, are _infidels_, inasmuch as they do not believe in the Bible: Deists and atheists alike are likewise considered _infidels_, inasmuch as they set themselves up against the Christian revelation; well-informed people are always _incredulous_ of stories respecting ghosts and apparitions.

####uncover 
**UNCOVER, DISCOVER, DISCLOSE.**  
To _uncover_, like _discover_, implies to take off the covering; but the former refers mostly to an artificial, material, and occasional covering; the latter, of rarer application, to a natural, moral, and habitual covering: plants are _uncovered_ that they may receive the benefit of the air; they are _discovered_ to aid the researches of the botanist.  
To _discover_ and _disclose_ (see [publish](entry://publish)) both signify to lay open, but they differ in the object and manner of the action: to _discover_ is to remove the covering which hides a thing from view, whether it be there by accident or design; to _disclose_ is to open that which has been closed: as many things may be covered which are not closed, such things may, by drawing aside the covering, be _discovered:_ a country is properly _discovered_, or a plant growing in some heretofore unknown place may be _discovered;_ whatever is _disclosed_ must have been previously closed or enclosed in some other body; as to _disclose_ the treasures which lie buried in the earth.  
So, in the figurative or moral application, a plot may be _discovered_, but a secret which lies deep in the bosom may be _disclosed._

####unction 
**UNCTION, UNGUENT.**  
Both of these words come from Latin _ungere_, to anoint, but _unguent_ has kept its literal significance, and _unction_, while not wholly losing its original meaning, has developed a figurative application. An _unguent_ is a soothing salve or oil applied to the skin; _unction_ had originally the same meaning, but it is now used figuratively to signify that which is soothing or healing. Moreover, from its original significance of an oil for anointing, it has developed another figurative meaning, and refers to a kind of manner or speech, insincere suavity or exaggerated fervor — so that it is a variation of that which is expressed in popular speech by the figurative use of _oily_, in "an _oily_ manner, " an _"oily_ address. " In the phrase _extreme unction_, the word retains its literal significance with the addition of a figurative meaning. It signifies the anointing of the eyes, ears, nostrils, hands, and feet of a person mortally ill to signify the application of the oil of grace to the soul. The phrase means literally the "last anointing. "

####under 
**UNDER, BELOW, BENEATH.**  
_Under_, like _hind_ in _behind_, and the German _unter, hinter_, etc., are all connected with the preposition _in_, implying the relation of enclosure. _Below_ denotes the state of being low; and _beneath_, Anglo-Saxon _beneothan_, allied to German _nieder_ and English _nether_, has the same original signification. It is evident, therefore, from the above, that the preposition _under_ denotes any situation of retirement or concealment; _below_, any situation of inferiority or lowness; and _beneath_, the same, only in a still greater degree. We are covered or sheltered by that which we stand _under;_ we excel or rise above that which is _below_ us; we look down upon that which is _beneath_ us: we live _under_ the protection of government; the sun disappears when it is _below_ the horizon; we are apt to tread upon that which is altogether _beneath_ us. 

####undergo 
**UNDERGO, BEAR, ENDURE, EXPERIENCE, SUFFER.**  
_Undergo_, a compound of the prefix _under_ and the English _go_, signifies, literally, to go, move, or pass under or below something, and has numerous applications. We undertake, or take upon ourselves, an enterprise, duty obligation; we _bear_ up with or against sorrow, misfortune, pain; we _endure_ or put up with physical suffering, wrongs, conditions that we cannot alter; we _suffer_ from annoyances, ill-health, untoward circumstances, accidents, losses, the enmity or machinations of others; and we _experience_, pass through, partake of, are subjected to, much that is unpleasant, disastrous, burdensome, heart-breaking.

####understanding 
**UNDERSTANDING, INTELLECT, INTELLIGENCE.**  
_Understanding_ (see [conceive](entry://conceive)), being the Saxon word, is employed to describe a familiar and easy power or operation of the mind in forming distinct ideas of things. _Intellect_ (see that word) is employed to mark the same operation in regard to higher and more abstruse objects. The _understanding_ applies to the first exercise of the rational powers: it is therefore aptly said of children and savages that they employ their _understandings_ on the simple objects of perception; a child uses his _understanding_ to distinguish the dimensions of objects or to apply the right names to the things that come before his notice.  
_Intellect_, being a matured state of the _understanding_, is most properly applied to the efforts of those who have their powers in full vigor: we speak of _understanding_ as the characteristic distinction between man and brute; but human beings are distinguished from one another by the measure of their _intellect._ We may expect the youngest children to employ an _understanding_ according to the opportunities which they have of using their senses; we are gratified when we see great _intellect_ in the youth whom we are instructing.  
_Intellect_ and _intelligence_ are derived from the same word; but _intellect_ is applied merely to human power and _intelligence_ to the spiritual power of higher beings, as the _intelligence_ of angels: so, when applied to human beings, it is taken in the most abstract sense for the _intellectual_ power: hence we speak of _intelligence_ as displayed in the countenance of a child whose looks evince that he has exerted his _intellect_ and thereby proved that it exists.

####undetermined 
**UNDETERMINED, UNSETTLED, UNSTEADY, WAVERING.**  
_Undetermined_ (see [determine](entry://determine)) is a temporary state of the mind; _unsettled_ is commonly more lasting: we are _undetermined_ in the ordinary concerns of life; we are _unsettled_ in matters of opinion: we may be _undetermined_ whether we shall go or stay; we are _unsettled_ in our faith or religious profession.  
_Undetermined_ and _unsettled_ are applied to particular objects; _unsteady_, and _wavering_ are habits of the mind: to be _unsteady_ is, in fact, to be habitually _unsettled_ in regard to all objects. An _unsettled_ character is one that has no settled principles: an _unsteady_ character has an unfitness in himself to settle. _Undetermined_ describes one uniform state of mind, namely, the want of determination: _wavering_ describes a changeable state, namely, the state of determining variously at different times. _Undetermined_ is always taken in an indifferent, _wavering_ mostly in a bad, sense: we may frequently be _undetermined_ from the nature of the case, which does not present motives for determining; but a person is mostly _wavering_, from a defect in his character, in cases where he might determine. A parent may with reason be _undetermined_ as to the line of life which he shall choose for his son: men of soft and timid characters are always _wavering_ in the most trivial, as well as the most important, concerns of life.

####undulate 
**UNDULATE, VIBRATE, WAVE.**  
_Undulate_, in Latin _undulatus_, from _unda_, a wave, allied to Greek _ίδωρ_, water, and the English word _water_ (as well as to the Russian root _vodá_, water, which appears in _vodka)_, refers to the rise and fall of the waves of the sea, and hence to any alternate elevation and depression of a surface. _Vibrate_, Latin _vibrare_, means to move to and fro or up and down. It usually signifies a quicker and more regular motion than _undulate_, with lesser elevations and depressions. _Wave_, as verb, comes from Anglo-Saxon _wafian;_ the noun _wave_, derived from the verb, took the place of the Middle English _wawe_, allied to _wag:_ it means to move to and fro in response to an impulse received from without. A flag _waves_ to and fro in the wind; we _wave_ a handkerchief to a friend on the deck of a steamer. _Wave_ does not suggest alternate elevation and depression as do _vibrate_ and _undulate._ It merely suggests a movement to and fro.

**UNFOLD, UNRAVEL, DEVELOP.**  
To _unfold_ is to open that which has been folded; to _unravel_ is to open that which has been _ravelled_ or tangled; to _develop_ is to open that which has been wrapped in an _envelope._ The application of these terms, therefore, to moral objects is obvious: what has been _folded_ and kept secret is _unfolded;_ in this manner a hidden transaction is _unfolded_ by being related circumstantially: what has been entangled in any mystery or confusion is _unravelled:_ in this manner a mysterious transaction is _unravelled_ if any circumstance is fully accounted for: what has been wrapped up so as to be entirely shut out from view is _developed;_ in this manner the plot of a play or novel, or the talent of a person, is _developed._

####unforeseen 
See [sudden](entry://sudden)

####unfunded 
**UNFUNDED, FLOATING.**  
_Unfunded_ is a compound of the prefix _un_, not, and _funded_, provided with funds, and signifies a monetary obligation that has not been paid through lack of necessary means. While the term implies a debt, comprising bills, notes, and other evidences, in varying amounts, and due at different dates, it is most commonly employed to designate the part of a debt remaining unpaid and standing against a corporation or government.  
A _floating_ debt is that _unfunded_ one which constitutes the real debt, the part of an originally larger one that is. still owing, is unpaid. The _unfunded_ debt of a government arises from arrears in its receipts, from obligations on which money has been raised, to be repaid out of future receipts. It is thus distinguished from a _funded_ debt, which is that part of a public debt for the payment of interest for the reduction of which funds are appropriated at necessary intervals. 

####ungainly 
**UNGAINLY, UNCOUTH.**  
_Ungainly_ is compounded of the negative prefix _un_ and Icelandic _gegn_, ready, serviceable: cf. Scotch _gane_, fit, meaning originally not fitting. _Uncouth_, from Anglo-Saxon _uncuth_, unknown, hence strange, signifies a lack of conformity to prevailing modes of conduct or style, hence roughness, lack of social grace, etc. (Compare the similar development of _outlandish_, which originally meant simply from another land.) _Ungainly_ refers mainly to physical awkwardness, _uncouth_ to awkwardness of speech or manner. An _ungainly_ person is one who is so constructed physically that he does not move with ease or grace. _Uncouth_ indicates a lack of education and social advantages. 

####ungovernable 
See [unruly](entry://unruly)

####ungraceful 
**UNGRACEFUL, INELEGANT, UNDIGNIFIED, UNEASY.**  
_Ungraceful_, a compound term, signifies, in its application to a person or object, that which is not pleasing to the eye or appropriate to its particular use. A person is _ungraceful_ who is awkward, clumsy, bungling, unhandy, rough, uncouth in manners, unrefined, unpolished; _undignified_, uncouth in speech, clownish, gawky, slouchy in action: _inelegant_, in the choice of language or attire; _uneasy_, overactive, restless, boorish, unmannerly, excessively nervous, in general bearing.  
A material object is _ungraceful_ when it is unbecoming, ill-fitted, inappropriate, lacking in harmonious, pleasing appearance, unsuitable, not conformable to surroundings. An article of attire is _ungraceful_ that does not correspond with other associated articles or does not accord with the wearer's complexion or figure. 

####unhappy 
**UNHAPPY, MISERABLE, WRETCHED.**  
_Unhappy_ is literally not to be happy; this is the negative condition of many who might be happy if they pleased. _Miserable_, from _misereri_, to pity, is to deserve pity; that is, to be positively and extremely _unhappy:_ this is the lot only of comparatively few: _wretched_, from our word _wreck_, Anglo-Saxon _wrecca_, an outcast (compare the Anglo-Saxon verb _wreccan_, to persecute, from which our words _wreck_ and the verb _wreak_, in the phrase _wreak vengeance_, are derived), signifies cast away or abandoned, that is, particularly _miserable_, which is the lot of still fewer. As happiness lies properly in the mind, _unhappy_ is taken in the proper sense with regard to the state of the feelings, but is figuratively extended to the outward circumstances which occasion the painful feelings; we lead an _unhappy_ life, or are in an _unhappy_ condition: as that which excites the compassion of others must be external, and the state of abandonment must of itself be an outward state, _miserable_ and _wretched_ are properly applied to the outward circumstances which cause the pain, and improperly to the pain which is occasioned. We may measure the force of these words, that is to say, the degree of _unhappiness_ which they express, only by the circumstances which cause the _unhappiness._ An _unhappy_ man is indefinite, as we may be _unhappy_ from slight circumstances or from those which are important; a child may be said to be _unhappy_ at the loss of a plaything; a man is _unhappy_ who leads a vicious life: _miserable_ and _wretched_ are more limited in their application; a child may be both _miserable_ and _wretched_ if it has some serious cause, either in its own mind or in its circumstances, to make it so: a man is _miserable_ who is tormented by his conscience; a mother will be _wretched_ whose child is taken from her.

####unimportant 
**UNIMPORTANT, INSIGNIFICANT, IMMATERIAL, INCONSIDERABLE.**  
The want of _importance_, of _consideration_, of _signification_, and of _matter_ or substance, is expressed by these terms. They differ, therefore, principally according to the meaning of the primitives; but they are so closely allied that they may be employed sometimes indifferently. _Unimportant_ regards the consequences of our actions: it is _unimportant_ whether we use this or that word in certain cases: _inconsiderable_ and _insignificant_ respects those things which may attract notice: the former is more adapted to the grave style, to designate the comparative low value of things; the latter is a familiar term which seems to convey a contemptuous meaning: in a description, we may say that the number, the size, the quantity, etc., is _inconsiderable;_ in speaking of persons, we may say they are _insignificant_ in stature, look, talent, station, and the like; or, speaking of things, an _insignificant_ production or an _insignificant_ word: _immaterial_ is a species of the _unimportant_ which is applied only to familiar subjects; it is _immaterial_ whether we go to-day or to-morrow; it is _immaterial_ whether we have a few or many. 

####uninterruptedly 
See [incessantly](entry://incessantly)

####union 
**UNION, CONFEDERATION, COALITION, FUSION.**  
These are all words used to signify a governmental or political combination. _Union_ is the most general word. It signifies a making different entities _one_, from Latin _unus_, one, and may refer to any combination. _Confederation, coalition_, and _fusion_ are different forms of political _union. Confederation_, from Latin _con_, together, and _fœdus_, league, means a joining together, a _union_ in which different groups surrender part of their individual rights or powers to a central authority, but without entirely losing their separate identities. In a _confederation_ such as that of the United States, for example, the states delegate certain of their powers to the central government without merging their separate identities in one. _Coalition_ is derived from the past participle of the Latin word _coalescere_, found in English _coalesce_, and meaning to grow together. It signifies a temporary union of representatives of political parties for the purpose of carrying through some project in which they are all interested. A _coalition_ cabinet is a cabinet composed of leaders of various political parties united in a common cause. _Fusion_, from the past participle _fusus_ of Latin _fundere_, to pour (meaning something poured together, so that separate identities are lost), refers to a _union_ of political parties in support of a single candidate or platform.

**UNOFFENDING, INOFFENSIVE.**  
Both of these words indicate the negative of _offending_ or _offensive_, and mean not _offending._ But _inoffensive_ refers to a general disposition; _unoffending_, to a particular case. An _inoffensive_ person is in the nature of things _unoffending;_ one who is _unoffending_ in one matter may not always be _inoffensive. Inoffensive_ often carries with it the faintest implication of contemptuous condescension on the part of the speaker. It may mean not able to _offend_, not having capacity or energy enough to _offend. Unoffending_ does not suggest this idea. 

####unpolluted

####unprecedented 
**UNPRECEDENTED, EXCEPTIONAL, UNEXAMPLED, UNRIVALLED, UNIQUE.**  
_Unprecedented_, a compound of the English _un_, not, and _precedented_, antecedent, previous, former, or prior, signifies that which is so rare that there is nothing to be compounded with it, something that is _sui generis_, of its own kind, standing alone, wholly by itself. It is a stronger term than _exceptional_, which implies that which is unusual, and it is more closely allied with _unexampled_ and _unrivalled_, each implying something without a counterpart or anything parallel with or equal to it. The distinction is seen, for instance, in a formal address. An _exceptional_ address may be one of unusual cleverness, interest, and brilliancy, without being so rare as to reach the acme of intellectual effort, yet it may not be an _unexampled_ one, much less an _unrivalled_ one, as the just application of those terms depends on the varying viewpoints of the hearers. Strictly, _unexampled_ implies that which is without the same likeness in its essentials, and _unrivalled_, that which is of the best, of the first water; but in common usage the terms are frequently erroneously applied to several objects or degrees of objects when in truth they belong to one only, as only one can be supreme. _Unique_ expresses the same idea in positive rather than negative terms. That which is _unique_ is the only one of its kind (from Latin _unus_, one). It is the superlative expression of the idea common to all these terms, and should not be compared; a thing is _unique;_ it cannot be more or most _unique._

####unpremeditated 
**UNPREMEDITATED, EXTEMPORANEOUS, IMPROMPTU, OFF-HAND, UNSTUDIED.**  
_Unpremeditated_, a compound of the English _un_, not, and _premeditated_, from the Latin _prœmeditatus, prœ_, before, and _meditari_, to meditate, implying to think of before, in advance of an action. This term is a very common one in criminology, signifying the commission of an act on the spur of the moment, on a sudden provocation, without previous cause, plan, or thought, as a felonious attack upon another that may result in a charge of assault and battery or of some degree of homicide, justifiable or otherwise.  
_Extemporaneous_, from the Latin phrase _ex tempore_, at the moment, and _impromptu_, from the phrase _in promptu_, in readiness, from _promere_, to bring forward, are most generally applied to a spoken address that is called forth by an unexpected invitation, permitting the person called upon no opportunity for preparation. _Off-hand_ is a less dignified term, as it implies a certain degree of carelessness, an indifferent fitting of language to occasion, a feeling that "anything will answer. " _Unstudied_ is most akin to _unpremeditated_, yet it implies a different effort, as an _unpremeditated_ act may be one not previously thought of, while an _unstudied_ act may be one that would ordinarily be studied or planned beforehand, but in its special application was done without any previous preparation.

####unruffled 
**UNRUFFLED, CALM, PEACEFUL, SMOOTH, TRANQUIL.**  
_Unruffled_, a compound of the English _un_, not, and _ruffled_, parallel with Old Dutch _ruyffelen_, to wrinkle, and allied to _ruff, rumple_, etc., is applied both to objects and persons, implying that which is not agitated, not stirred up, not changed from a normal condition. The surface of a stream remains _unruffled_ when it is not forced into ripples by the wind; a person, when under exciting conditions, displays neither agitation, nervousness, apprehension, nor fear. The sea, the atmosphere, a person, are _calm_ when undisturbed by abnormal conditions; they are then said to be serene, placid, imperturbable. _Peaceful_ and _peaceable_ are terms frequently misapplied. The former signifies freedom from agitation or commotion, and thus belongs to the present group, while the latter signifies freedom from strife or contest.  
_Smooth_ and _even_, too, are likewise used erroneously, to imply a level condition; but they really signify more than that. _Smooth_, as distinguished from _even_, means that which i is free from every degree of roughness, however small, while whatever is _even_ may be free only from unusual roughness or irregularities. _Smooth_, therefore, in its truest application is in full accord with _unruffled. Tranquil_, however, admits of but one condition, that is, freedom from agitation, physical or mental, from disturbance, roughness of any character or degree, or from anything that would interfere with quietude, repose. 

####unruly 
**UNRULY, UNGOVERNABLE, REFRACTORY.**  
_Unruly_ marks the want of disposition to be ruled; _ungovernable_, an absolute incapacity to be governed: the former is a temporary or partial error, the latter is an habitual defect in the temper: a high-spirited child will be occasionally _unruly;_ any child of strong passions will become _ungovernable_ by excessive indulgence: we say that our wills are _unruly_ and our tempers are _ungovernable. Refractory_, from _refractus_, past participle of the Latin _refrangere_, to break open, marks the disposition to break everything down before it: it is the excess of the _unruly_ with regard to children: the _unruly_ is, however, negative; but the _refractory_ is positive: an _unruly_ child objects to be ruled; a _refractory_ child sets up a positive resistance to all rule; an _unruly_ child may be altogether silent and passive; a _refractory_ child always commits himself by some act of insubordination in word or deed: he is _unruly_ if in any degree he gives trouble in the _ruling;_ he is _refractory_ if he actively resists being ruled. 

####unsatisfactory 
**UNSATISFACTORY, DISSATISFYING, INSUFFICIENT.**  
All these terms mean not meeting the wishes or expectations. _Unsatisfactory_, however, is a less positive term than _dissatisfying._ That which is _unsatisfactory_ fails to satisfy; that which is _dissatisfying_ produces a positive emotional reaction which is the opposite to satisfaction. One fails to meet the conditions; the other definitely opposes them. _Insufficient_ means literally not enough. It indicates a special kind of unsatisfactoriness. That which is _insufficient_ is lacking in quantity; that which is _unsatisfactory_ may be lacking in quality as well. That which is _insufficient_ is _unsatisfactory;_ that which is _unsatisfactory_ may be much more than _insufficient._

####unsearchable 
**UNSEARCHABLE, INSCRUTABLE.**  
These terms are both applied to things set above the understanding of man, but not altogether indifferently; for that which is _unsearchable_ is not set at so great a distance from us as that which is _inscrutable:_ for that which is _searched_ is in common concerns easier to be found than that which requires a _scrutiny._ The ways of God are to us finite creatures more or less _unsearchable;_ but the mysterious plans of Providence, as frequently evinced in the affairs of men, are altogether _inscrutable._

####unspeakable 
**UNSPEAKABLE, INEFFABLE, UNUTTERABLE, INEXPRESSIBLE.**  
_Unspeakable_ and _ineffable_, from the Latin _ineffabilis_, based on _in_, not, and _effabilis_, utterable, from _effari_, to speak out, have precisely the same meaning; but the _unspeakable_ is said of objects in general, particularly of that which is above human conception, and surpasses the power of language to describe; as the _unspeakable_ goodness of God: _ineffable_ is said of such objects as cannot be painted in words with adequate force; as the _ineffable_ sweetness of a person's look: _unutterable_ and _inexpressible_ are extended in their signification to that which is incommunicable by signs from one being to another; thus grief is _unutterable_ which it is not in the power of the sufferer by any sounds to bring home to the feelings of another; grief is _inexpressible_ which is not to be expressed by looks, or words, or any signs. _Unutterable_ is therefore applied only to the individual who wishes to give _utterance; inexpressible_ may be said of that which is to be expressed concerning others: our own pains are _unutterable;_ the sweetness of a person's countenance is _inexpressible._

####unswerving 
**UNSWERVING, CONSTANT, DETERMINED, RESOLUTE.**  
In the moral sense, _unswerving_ implies the quality that makes a person steadfast in his course of life, in his friendships, in his varied dealings with others, always resolved, faithful, persevering, unhesitating, unwavering, wholly dependable. He is _constant_ whose course of action is incessant, uninterrupted, regular, who remains true through all contingencies. _Determined_ is a more vigorous term, as it implies a consideration of certain conditions, a decision as to a proper course to follow, and a persistent adherence to that course, despite allurements or seeming advantages to the contrary. A _resolute_ person is one possessing the quality of more than ordinary firmness of purpose, one having a fixed, unalterable purpose, one constant in the pursuit of an aim, one who is unshaken on all occasions, undaunted, inflexible, stout-hearted under trying or adverse circumstances. The terms _determined_ and _resolute_ have various shades of meaning, which are more critically considered under the term DECIDED.

####untruth 
**UNTRUTH, FALSEHOOD, FALSITY, LIE.**  
_Untruth is_ an _untrue_ saying; _falsehood_ and _lie_ are _false_ sayings: _untruth_ of itself reflects no disgrace on the agent; it may be unintentional or not: a _falsehood_ and a _lie_ are intentional _false_ sayings, differing only in degree as to the guilt of the offender: a _falsehood_ is not always spoken for the express intention of deceiving, but a _lie_ is uttered only for the worst of purposes. Some persons have a habit of telling _falsehoods_ from the mere love of talking: those who are guilty of bad actions endeavor to conceal them by _lies._ Children are apt to speak _untruths_ for want of understanding the value of words: travellers, from a love of exaggeration, are apt to introduce _falsehoods_ into their narrations: it is the nature of a _lie_ to increase itself to a tenfold degree; one _lie_ must be backed by many more.  
_Falsehood is_ also used in the abstract sense for what is _false. Falsity_ is never used but in the abstract sense, for the property of the _false._ The former is general, the latter particular, in the application: the truth or _falsehood_ of an assertion is not always to be distinctly proved; the _falsity_ of any particular person's assertion may be proved by the evidence of others.

####unveil 
**UNVEIL, DISCLOSE, REMOVE, REVEAL, SHOW.**  
_Unveil_, a compound of the English _un_, not, and _veil_, a covering, the latter in Old French _veile_, French _voile_, from the Latin _velum_, a sail, from _vehere_, to carry _(i.e._, that which carries or moves the boat), and hence any piece of cloth, or a covering, signifies, as a transitive, to remove a covering from something, to make clear something that was previously hidden or but slightly visible; as an intransitive, to come to light or become known. The term has many applications — among them: we _unveil_ a memorial, statue, or painting by removing its temporary covering; we _unveil_ a secret, conspiracy, plot, purpose, by making it known; we _unveil_ a mental burden by confiding it to another.  
_Disclose_, from the Latin _discludere_, to open, signifies the act of making known or public something that is concealed, to bring to light something not generally known, and _reveal_, from the Latin _revelare_, to draw back a cover, in French _révéler_, signifies to divulge something known to ourselves but not to others, to lay bare a mystery or a secret purpose, in a special sense, to make known something which could not become known without divine or supernatural instruction. _Remove_ signifies to take away, put aside, disassociate, separate, as to displace something that covers or conceals something else; and _show_ implies an exhibition, a display, a presentation to the view, of something that has not been generally seen, by an action that makes it visible. 

####unwilling 
See [averse](entry://averse)

####unworthy 
**UNWORTHY, WORTHLESS.**  
_Unworthy_ is a term of less reproach than _worthless;_ for the former signifies not to be _worthy_ of praise or honor; the latter signifies to be without any worth, and consequently in the fullest sense bad. It may be a mark of modesty or humility to say that I am an _unworthy_ recipient of your kindness; but it would be folly and extravagance to say that I am a _worthless_ recipient of your kindness. There are many _unworthy_ members in every religious community; but every society that is conducted upon proper principles will take care to exclude _worthless_ members. In regard to one another, we are often _unworthy_ of the distinctions or privileges we enjoy; in regard to our Maker, we are all _unworthy_ of His goodness, though not _worthless_ in His eyes. 

####upbraid

####uphold 
**UPHOLD, AID, MAINTAIN, SANCTION, SUPPORT, VINDICATE.**  
_Uphold_, a compound of the English _up_ and _hold_, from a widely distributed Germanic root, _hal_, signifying to raise, hence to grasp and keep, means to keep raised or elevated. The term is equally applicable to persons and objects. We _uphold_ a person when we agree with him, stand by him, make his attitude our own, on some controversy, proposition, or position he has assumed; we _aid_ him by helping, assisting him to retain the position or attitude he has taken; we _maintain_ his actions or declarations by affirming or defending them, adopting them as consistent with our own judgment; we _sanction_ what he does or says by confirming, assenting to, coinciding with, the act or saying; we _support_ him by favoring, seconding, consenting to, or vouching for, his position; and we _vindicate_ him when we corroborate, establish the validity, or defend successfully that which he has said or done. In a material sense, _uphold_ and _support_ are applied to one object set beneath another, to bear it up, sustain it, or keep it from falling, as a pillar, base, foundation, or any object on which another object rests, and _maintain_ is applied to the province or duty of the object so used.

####usage 
**USAGE, CUSTOM, PRESCRIPTION.**  
The _usage_ is what one has been long used to do; _custom_ is what one generally does; _prescription_ is what is prescribed by usage to be done. The _usage_ acquires force and sanction by dint of time; the _custom_ acquires sanction by the frequency of its being done or the numbers doing it; the _prescription_ acquires force by the authority which _prescribes._ Hence it arises that _customs_ vary in every age, but that _usage_ and _prescription_ supply the place of written law.

####utility 
**UTILITY, USE, SERVICE, AVAIL.**  
_Utility_ and use both come ultimately from _utor. Service_, from the Latin _servire_, to employ or make use of. _Avail_, from _a_ or _ad_ and French _valoir_, Latin _valere_, signifies strength for a given purpose or to a given end.  
All these terms imply fitness to be employed to advantage (see [advantage](entry://advantage)). _Utility_ is applied in a general sense to what may be usefully employed: _use_ to that which is actually so employed; things are said to be of general _utility_, or a thing is said to be of a particular _use._  
The word _use_ refers us to the employment of things generally and the advantage derived from such use; _service_, the particular state or capacity of a thing to be usefully employed. It is proper, therefore, to say that prayers and entreaties are of _use;_ but in speaking of tools, weapons, and the like, to say they are of _service._ Prudence forbids us to destroy anything that may be of _use;_ economy enjoins upon us not to throw aside anything as long as it is fit for _service._  
All the preceding terms are taken absolutely; _avail_ is a term of relative import; it respects the circumstances under which a thing may be fit or otherwise to be employed with efficacy. When entreaties are found to be of no _avail_, females sometimes try the force of tears. 

####utopian 
**UTOPIAN, CHIMERICAL, FANCIFUL, IDEAL, VISIONARY.**  
_Utopian_ was derived from the Greek _ού_, not, and _τόπος_, a place, literally nowhere, and has the sense of a good or happy place. The term _Utopia_ was coined by Sir Thomas More for his famous work, published in 1513, describing an imaginary island, where the most nearly perfect system of laws and institutions existed; hence _Utopian_, as an adjective, has come to apply to anything founded on or involving ideal perfection, and, as a substantive, to a person enthusiastic in efforts to promote schemes for unalloyed social happiness. The term has had a general acceptance ever since Sir Thomas coined it, as it seemed to apply admirably to a class of political and social propagandists who aimed at impracticable, ideal perfectibility.  
The term _chimerical_, from the Latin _chimœra_ and Greek _χίμαιρα_, takes us back to the annals of mythology, wherein the _chimera_, is described as a fire-spouting monster with a lion's head, a serpent's tail, and a goat's body, that was killed by Bellerophon. Hesiod narrates that the monster was the daughter of Typhaon and Echidna. When the term was introduced into common English language, it was used to imply an unreal creature of the imagination, and hence any vain or idle fancy. As _fancy_ (for derivation see [fanciful](entry://fanciful)) signifies a notion, caprice, idea, creative imagination, or that which does not really exist, but is hoped to exist, so _fanciful_ signifies whatever one would like to see, do, or possess, yet is incapable of in any of these respects. So, too, is the _ideal_ a _visionary_ condition impossible of realization, however desirable or beneficial that state might be, because existing only in the imagination, a mental image, a conception of what ought to be. This term is also applied to a person or object regarded as a standard of perfection, as possessing qualities far above the ordinary. 

####utter 
**UTTER, SPEAK, ARTICULATE, PRONOUNCE.**  
_Utter,_ from _out_, Middle English _outen_, a verb formed from the adverb _out_, corresponding to the colloquial expression "out with it, " signifies to send forth a sound: this, therefore, is a more general term than _speak_, which is to _utter_ an intelligible sound. We may _utter_ a groan; we _speak_ words only or that which is intended to serve as words. To _speak_, therefore, is only a species of _utterance;_ a dumb man has _utterance_, but not _speech. Articulate_ and _pronounce_ are modes of _speaking;_ to _articulate_, from _articulation_, a joint, is to _pronounce_ distinctly the letters or syllables of words; which is the first effort of a child beginning to _speak._ It is of great importance to make a child _articulate_ every letter when he first begins to _speak_ or read. To _pronounce_, from the Latin _pronunciare_, to speak out loud, is a formal mode of _speaking._ A child must first _articulate_ the letters and the syllables, then he _pronounces_ or sets forth the whole word; this is necessary before he can _speak_ to be understood.

####uttermost 
**UTTERMOST, EXTREME, FARTHEST, LAST.**  
_Uttermost_, from Anglo-Saxon _utor_, signifies the _extreme_ outer edge of anything. It therefore is a more limited application of the idea contained in _extreme._ The same is true of its relation to _farthest_ and _last. Farthest_ and _last_ have a meaning similar to that of _extreme_, but they emphasize the utmost limit suggested in _extreme_ from different points of view. _Farthest_ lays the stress on distance; _last_ expresses the idea in terms of numbers, or rather from the standpoint of some one counting. _Last_ is that which comes at the end of a series. 

####vacancy 
**VACANCY, VACUITY, INANITY.**  
_Vacancy_ and _vacuity_ both denote the space unoccupied, or the abstract quality of being unoccupied. _Inanity_, from the Latin _inanis_, denotes the abstract quality of emptiness or of not containing anything: hence the former terms _vacancy_ and _vacuity_ are used in an indifferent sense; _inanity_ always in a bad sense: there may be a _vacancy_ in the mind, or a _vacancy_ in life, which we may or may not fill up as we please; but _inanity_ of character denotes the want of the essentials that constitute a character. 

####vacant 
See [empty](entry://empty); [idle](entry://idle)

####vacillate 
**VACILLATE, WAVER.**  
_Vacillate_, from Latin _vacillare_, to waver, is the Latin word corresponding to the native English _waver_, a frequentative of _wave. Waver_ is used with a literal as well as a figurative significance. _Vacillate_ is now used only figuratively to indicate mental indecision, an inability to determine upon a course of action or an opinion and to stick to it. It has a more limited application than _waver_, but is more specific within its narrower field. 

####vagary 
**VAGARY, CROTCHET, FANCY, WHIM.**  
_Vagary_, in Latin _vagari_, French _vaguer_, Italian _vagare_, as a transitive signifies to roam, stroll, wander; as a substantive, a wandering of the thoughts, a wild freak, a _whim_, an unsubstantial purpose, an imaginary concept, a capricious frolic; as a verb, to wander about or wind, as a river.  
A _vagary_, in whatever form it may assume, is an outgrowth of an unsteady mind, in most instances harmless, though often annoying to others; in some instances a consequence of imbecility, delirium, or insanity.  
A _caprice_ (derived through French from Italian _capriccio_, from _caprio_, goat, meaning a sudden leap of the mind like the leap of a goat — compare _caper)_, or sudden impulse of the mind, may take the form of an innocent frolic or of a questionable act; a _crotchet_, originally a musical term, "tune" or "air, " hence a _fancy_ or a _whim_, is usually a _fancy_ made especially noticeable by the tenacity with which its possessor clings to and displays it, a thought or idea out of the ordinary, a bit of imagination, groundless but conjured up; and a _whim_ may be a sudden flash of the mind, a more or less ridiculous impression, or the result of a progressive aberration.

####vain 
**VAIN, INEFFECTUAL, FRUITLESS.**  
These epithets are all applied to our endeavors: but the term _vain_ (see [idle](entry://idle)) is the most general and indefinite; the other terms arc particular and definite. What we aim at, as well as what we strive for, may be _vain;_ but _ineffectual_, that is, not _effectual_ (see **effective** under [effect](entry://effect)), and _fruitless_, that is, without _fruit_, signifying not producing the desired fruit of one's labor, refer only to the termination or value of our labors. When the object aimed at is general in its import it is common to term the endeavor _vain_ when it cannot attain this object: it is _vain_ to attempt to reform a person's character until he is convinced that he stands in need of reformation; when the means employed are inadequate for the attainment of the particular end, it is usual to call the endeavor _ineffectual;_ cool arguments will be _ineffectual_ in convincing any one inflamed with a particular passion; when labor is specifically employed for the attainment of a particular object, it is usual to term it _fruitless_ if it fail: peace-makers will often find themselves in this condition, that their labors will be rendered _fruitless_ by the violent passions of angry opponents. 

####valor 
See **bravery** under [brave](entry://brave)

####valuable 
**VALUABLE, PRECIOUS, COSTLY.**  
_Valuable_ signifies fit to be _valued; precious_, having a high price; _costly, costing_ much money. _Valuable_ expresses directly the idea of _value; precious_ and _costly_ express the same idea indirectly: on the other hand, that which is _valuable_ is said only to be fit or deserving of _value;_ but _precious_ and _costly_ denote that which is highly _valuable_, according to the ordinary measure of _valuing_ objects, that is, by the _price_ they bear; hence, the latter two express the idea much more strongly than the former.  
They are similarly distinguished in their moral application: a book is _valuable_ according to its contents, or according to the estimate which men set upon it, either individually or collectively. The Bible is the only _precious_ book in the world that has intrinsic _value_, that is, set above all price. There are many _cosily_ things, which are _valuable_ only to the individuals who are disposed to expend money upon them.  
**VALUE, WORTH, RATE, PRICE.** — _Value_, from the feminine past participle of the French _valoir_, Latin _valere_, to be strong, implies those essential qualities which constitute its strength. _Worth_, in Anglo-Saxon _weorth_, valuable, a Germanic word from the root _war_, to guard or keep, found in _wary, ward_, etc., signifies that which deserves to be kept and guarded, hence the good experienced or felt to exist in a thing. _Rate_ (see [proportion](entry://proportion)). _Price_, through Old French from Latin _pretium_, signifies what a thing is sold for.  
_Value_ is a general and indefinite term, applied to whatever is conceived to be good in a thing the _worth_ is that good only which is conceived or known as such. The _value_, therefore, of a thing is as variable as the humors and circumstances of men; it may be nothing or something very great in the same object at the same time in the eyes of different men. The _worth_ is, however, that _value_ which is acknowledged; it is therefore something more fixed and permanent: we speak of the _value_ of external objects which are determined by taste; but the _worth_ of things as determined by rule. The _value_ of a book that is out of print is fluctuating and uncertain; but its real _worth_ may not be more than what it would fetch for waste paper. The _rate_ and _price_ are the measures of that _value_ or _worth;_ the former in a general, the latter in a particular, application to mercantile transactions. Whatever we give in exchange for another thing, whether according to a definite or an indefinite estimation, is said to be done at a certain _rate;_ thus we purchase pleasure at a dear _rate_ when it is at the expense of our health: _price_ is the _rate_ of exchange estimated by coin or any other medium: hence _price_ is a fixed _rate_, and may be figuratively applied in that sense to moral objects; as when health is expressly sacrificed to pleasure, it may be termed the _price_ of pleasure.  
**VALUE, PRIZE, ESTEEM.** — To _value_ is in the literal sense to fix a _value_ on a thing. _Prize_, signifying to fix a _price_, and _esteem_ are both modes of _valuing._  
To _value_ is to set any _value_, real or supposititious, relative or absolute, on a thing: in this sense men _value_ gold above silver, or an appraiser _values_ goods. To _value_ may be applied to either material or spiritual subjects, to corporeal or mental actions: _prize_ and _esteem_ are taken only as mental actions; the former in reference to sensible or moral objects, the latter only to moral objects: we may _value_ books according to their market price, or we may _value_ them according to their contents; we _prize_ books only for their contents, in which sense _prize_ is a much stronger term than _value;_ we also _prize_ men for their usefulness to society; we _esteem_ their moral char-

**VARIATION, VARIETY.**  
_Variation_ denotes the act of _varying_ (see [change](entry://change)); _variety_ denotes the quality of _varying_, or the thing _varied._ The astronomer observes the _variations_ in the heavens; the philosopher observes the variations in the climate from year to year. _Variety_ is pleasing to all persons, but to none so much as the young and the fickle: there is an infinite _variety_ in every species of objects, animate or inanimate.

####venal 
**VENAL, MERCENARY.**  
_Venal_, from the Latin _venalis_, signifies salable or ready to be sold, which, applied as it commonly is to persons, is a much stronger term than _mercenary._ A _venal_ man gives up all principles for interest; a _mercenary_ man seeks his interest without regard to principle: _venal_ writers are such as write in favor of the cause that can promote them to riches or honors; a servant is commonly a _mercenary_, who gives his services according as he is paid: those who are loudest in their professions of political purity are the best subjects for a minister to make _venal;_ a _mercenary_ spirit is engendered in the minds of those who devote themselves exclusively to trade.

####venial 
**VENIAL, PARDONABLE.**  
_Venial_, from the Latin _venia_, pardon or indulgence, is applied to what may be tolerated without express disparagement to the individual or direct censure; but the _pardonable_ is that which may only escape severe censure, yet cannot be allowed: garrulity is a _venial_ offence in old age; levity in youth is _pardonable_ in single instances.

####vexation 
**VEXATION, MORTIFICATION, CHAGRIN.**  
_Vexation_ (see **displeasure** under [displease](entry://displease)) springs from a variety of causes, acting unpleasantly on the inclinations or passions of men; _mortification_ (see [humble](entry://humble)) is a strong degree of _vexation_, which arises from particular circumstances acting on particular passions: the loss of a day's pleasure is a _vexation_ to one who is eager for pleasure; the loss of a prize, or the circumstance of coming into disgrace where we expected honor, is a _mortification_ to an ambitious person. _Vexation_ arises principally from our wishes and views being crossed; _mortification_, from our pride and self-importance being hurt; _chagrin_, in French _chagrin_ (compare the title of Balzac's novel, _La Peau de Chagrin)_, comes originally from _shagreen_, a word of Oriental origin meaning a rough and granular skin used for polishing, hence by extension anything irritating, or a state of irritation; disappointments are always attended with more or less _vexation_, according to the circumstances which give pain and trouble; an exposure of our poverty may be more or less of a _mortification_, according to the value which we set on wealth and grandeur; a refusal of a request will produce more or less _chagrin_, as it is accompanied with circumstances more or less _mortifying_ to our pride.

####view 
**VIEW, SURVEY, PROSPECT.**  
_View_ (see [look](entry://look)) and _survey_, compounded of _vey_ or _view_ and _sur_, over (Coleridge uses the word _surview_ to mean a complete view of a thing as a whole), mark the act of the person, namely, the looking over a thing with more or less attention: _prospect_, from the Latin _prospectus_ and _prospicere_, to see before, designates the thing seen. We take a _view_ or _survey;_ the _prospect_ presents itself: the _view_ is of an indefinite extent; the _survey_ is always comprehensive in its nature. Ignorant people take but narrow _views_ of things; men take more or less enlarged _views_, according to their cultivation: the capacious mind of a genius takes a _survey_ of all nature. The _view_ depends altogether on the train of a person's thoughts; the _prospect_ is set before him, it depends upon the nature of the thing: our _views_ of advancement are sometimes very fallacious; our _prospects_ are very delusive; both occasion disappointment; the former is the keener, as we have to blame the miscalculation upon ourselves. Sometimes our _prospects_ depend upon our _views_, at least in matters of religion; he who forms erroneous _views_ of a future state has not foreseen the _prospect_ beyond the grave.  
**VIEW, PROSPECT, LANDSCAPE.** — _View_ and _prospect_, though applied here to external objects of sense, have a similar distinction as in the preceding article. The _view_ is not only that which may be seen, but that which is actually seen; hence the term _view_ is mostly coupled with the person _viewing_, although a _prospect_ exists continually, whether seen or not: hence we speak of our _view_ being intercepted, but not our _prospect_ intercepted; a confined or bounded _view_, but a lively or dreary _prospect_, or the _prospect_ clears up or extends.  
_View_ is an indefinite term; it may be said either of a number of objects or of a single object, of a whole or of a part: _prospect_ is said only of an aggregate number of objects; we may have a _view_ of a town, of a number of scattered houses, of a single house, or of the spire of a steeple; but the _prospect_ comprehends that which comes within the range of the eye. _View_ may be said of that which is seen directly or indirectly; _prospect_ only of that which directly presents itself to the eye: hence a drawing of an object may be termed a _view_, although not a _prospect. View_ is confined to no particular objects; _prospect_ mostly suggests rural objects; and _landscape_ means only a _view_ on land. _Landscape, land-skip_, or _landshape_, denote any portion of country which is in a particular form: hence the _landscape_ is a species of _prospect._ A _prospect_ may be wide, and comprehend an assemblage of objects both of nature and art; but a _landscape_ is narrow, and lies within the compass of the naked eye: hence it is also that _landscape_ may be taken for the drawing of a _landscape_, and consequently for a species of _view:_ the taking of _views_ or _landscapes_ is the last exercise of the learner in drawing.

####violent 
**VIOLENT, FURIOUS, BOISTEROUS, VEHEMENT, IMPETUOUS.**  
_Violent_ signifies having force (see [force](entry://force)). _Furious_ signifies having _fury_ (see [anger](entry://anger)). _Boisterous_ comes possibly from _bestir_, signifying ready to _bestir_ or come into motion. _Vehement_, in Latin _vehemens_, compounded of _veho_ and _mens_, signifies carried away by the mind or the force of passion. _Impetuous_ signifies having an _impetus_ (from _in_, on, and _petere_, to fly, hence to seek, to rush on, to fall upon).  
_Violent_ is here the most general term, including the idea of force or violence, which is common to them all; it is as general in its application as in its meaning. When _violent_ and _furious_ are applied to the same objects, the latter expresses a higher degree of the former: a _furious_ whirlwind is _violent_ beyond measure. _Violent_ and _boisterous_ are likewise applied to the same objects; but the _boisterous_ refers only to the _violence_ of the motion or noise: hence we say that a wind is _violent_ inasmuch as it acts with great force upon all bodies; it is _boisterous_ inasmuch as it causes the great motion of bodies: _impetuous_, like _boisterous_, is also applied to bodies moving with great _violence._  
These terms are all applied to persons, or what is personal, with a similar distinction: a man is _violent_ in his opinions, _violent_ in his measures, _violent_ in his resentments; he is _furious_ in his anger, or has a _furious_ temper; he is _vehement_ in his affections or passions, _vehement_ in love, _vehement_ in zeal, _vehement_ in pursuing an object, _vehement_ in expression: _violence_ transfers itself to some external object on which it acts with force; but _vehemence_ implies that species of _violence_ which is confined to the person himself: we may dread _violence_ because it is always liable to do mischief; we ought to suppress our _vehemence_ because it is injurious to ourselves: a _violent_ partisan renders himself obnoxious to others; a man who is _vehement_ in any cause puts it out of his own power to be of use. _Impetuosity_ is rather the extreme of _violence_ or _vehemence:_ an _impetuous_ attack is an excessively _violent_ attack; an _impetuous_ character is an excessively _vehement_ character. _Boisterous_ is said of the manner and the behavior rather than the mind. 

####virgin 
**VIRGIN, DAMSEL, GIRL, LASS, MAID, MAIDEN.**  
All these words indicate a young unmarried woman. _Virgin_, Latin _virgo, virginis_, refers specifically to a lack of experience of sexual intercourse, and may be used simply as a synonyme of _pure, untouched_, etc., as when we speak of _virgin_ soil, _virgin_ forests, etc. _Damsel_ comes from the Old French _damoisel_, a young page or squire, from Late Latin _dominicellus_, a little lord, the diminutive of _dominus_, lord. _Girl_, also, was originally applied to a boy; it meant a child in general. _Lass_ may be of Scandinavian origin. _Maid_ is an abbreviation of _maiden_, Anglo-Saxon _mœgden_, an unmarried girl. Of these terms _girl_ is the usual word; _virgin_ carries the special emphasis upon chastity. _Lass_ is archaic or colloquial; _maiden_ is poetic, laying some emphasis upon the idea suggested in _virgin; maid_ is poetic, but is also used colloquially to indicate a female servant. _Damsel_ is also a somewhat poetic and archaic word, sometimes humorously applied to particularly unpoetic persons. 

####virtuous 
**VIRTUOUS, CHASTE, GOOD, MORAL, PURE, UPRIGHT.**  
_Virtuous_, in French _vertueux_, from Low Latin _virtuosus_, Latin _virtus_, indicated the proper character of a man (_vir_), the sum of all manly virtues. It now signifies the person who is at heart morally _good_, who abstains from vice, acts in the spirit of the _moral_ law, is brave, valorous, and strong in principles, efficient through the operation of inherent qualities, _pure_ in deed and thought, _upright_, honest, impartial, prompt in all his dealings, and, when applied to women, one having excellent qualities, specifically being _chaste, pure_, unspotted. When applied to actions the term signifies that which is done in conformity with the moral or divine law or with duty, that which is beneficial to others, that which creates or promotes goodness, morality, purity, in the community. 

####virulent 
**VIRULENT, MALIGNANT.**  
_Virulent_ comes from Latin _virus_, originally slime, but used to signify poison. _Malignant_ comes from Latin _malus_, bad, and _gignere_, to be born, to be of a certain nature. (Compare _benignant_ for a similar formation and contrary meaning.) Both words signify actively and violently hostile or evil. In accordance with their derivations, however, _virulent_ indicates that which is poisonous, _malignant_ that which is fatally hostile to life or peace. _Virulent_ speech is speech so permeated by intense and morbid ill-will that it seems to be poisoned. _Venomous_ has a similar meaning, but is not so strong a word as _virulent. Malignant_ speech is that which is also hostile; but the emphasis is placed upon the ill-will itself, not upon its morbid and poisonous character. _Malignant_ is applied more frequently to actions and facial expression, _virulent_ mainly to speech and emotion.

####vision 
**VISION, APPARITION, PHANTOM, SPECTRE, GHOST.**  
_Vision_, from the Latin _visus_, seeing or. seen, signifies either the act of seeing or thing seen: _apparition_, from _appear_, signifies the thing that appears. As the thing seen is only the improper signification, the term _vision_ is never employed but in regard to some agent: the _vision_ depends upon the state of the visual organ; the _vision_ of a person whose sight is defective will frequently be fallacious, he will see some things double which are single, long which are short, and the like. In like manner, if the sight be miraculously impressed, his _vision_ will enable him to see that which is supernatural: hence it is that _vision is_ either true or false, according to the circumstances of the individual; and a _vision_, signifying a thing seen, is taken for a supernatural exertion of the _vision; apparition_, on the contrary, refers us to the object seen; this may be true or false, according to the manner in which it presents itself. Joseph was warned by a _vision_ to fly into Egypt with his family; Mary Magdalene was informed of the resurrection of our Saviour by an _apparition:_ feverish people often think they see _visions;_ timid and credulous people sometimes take trees and posts for _apparitions. Phantom_, from the Greek _φάντασμα_, based on _φαίνω_, to appear, is used for a false _apparition_ or the _appearance_ of a thing otherwise than what it is; thus the _ignis fatuus_, vulgarly called jack-o'-lantern, is a _phantom. Spectre_, formed from _specere_, to behold, and _ghost_, from Anglo-Saxon _gast_, a spirit, are the _apparitions_ of immaterial substances. The _spectre_ is taken for any spiritual being that appears, but _ghost_ is taken only for the spirits of departed men who appear to their fellow-creatures: a _spectre_ is sometimes made to appear on the stage; _ghosts_ exist mostly in the imagination of the young and the ignorant.

**VOCATION, CALLING, EMPLOYMENT, OCCUPATION, PROFESSION.**  
All these words refer to a man's habitual business. _Vocation_ is the Latin word corresponding to Teutonic _calling._ It means the business to which the natural talents or tastes lead a man. _Employment_ signifies a more temporary business than _occupation. Profession_ implies a formal intellectual training and is applied to the occupations demanding such a training — as law, medicine, etc. 

####vogue 
**VOGUE, FASHION.**  
_Vogue_, ultimately from a Germanic word allied to _wave_ or _wag_, and _fashion_, from Latin _factionem_, a noun derived from _facere_, to make, have much the same meaning, but _vogue is_ a somewhat more specific and sophisticated word applied to the fashion that makes a particular appeal to the wealthy and otherwise _élite_ and is temporarily emphasized by them.

####voluble 
**VOLUBLE, FLUENT, GLIB, LOQUACIOUS, TALKATIVE.**  
_Voluble_, a French term taken from the Latin _volubilem_, that from _volvere_, signifies that which IS easily turned about, rolled, or fickle. _Fluent_, from Latin _fluere_, to flow, signifies a ready speech which resembles Tennyson's brook or a brimming river in its continuous movement. _Glib_, originally _slippery, is_ allied to the verb _glide._ (Compare Dutch _glibbery.) Loquacious is_ derived ultimately from the Latin _loqui_, to speak, through _loquax_, talkative, and corresponds to _talkative_ in its derivation. These words all mean ready of speech, but there are slight shades of difference between them. _Fluent_ simply indicates speech that is uttered easily, without hesitation. It is generally a term of praise, or, at least, merely indifferent, not derogatory. _Loquacious_ may be derogatory. A _loquacious_ person is one who talks a great deal or talks too much. _Talkative_ has a similar significance, but, being of English derivation, it carries its meaning on the face of it more plainly than does _loquacious_ and is a more homely word. _Voluble_ means both _fluent_ and _loquacious_, inclined to talk freely and uttering the words with great speed and readiness. _Glib_ means ready of speech, with especial reference to plausible and conciliatory language.

_Vote_ comes from _votum_, the neuter past participle of Latin _vovere_, to vow, and has therefore the same derivation as English _vow;_ it signified a formal expression of opinion. _Suffrage_ comes from Latin _suffragium. Voice_ is here figuratively taken for the _voice_ that is raised in favor of a thing.  
The _vote_ is the wish itself, whether expressed or not; a person has a _vote_, that is, the power of wishing; but the _suffrage_ and the _voice_ are the wish that is expressed; a person gives his _suffrage_ or his _voice._ The _vote_ is the settled and fixed wish, it is that by which social concerns in life are determined; the _suffrage_ is a _vote_ given only in particular cases; the _voice_ is the declared opinion or wish, expressed either by individuals or the public at large. The _vote_ and _voice_ are given either for or against a person or thing; the _suffrage_ is commonly given in favor of a person: in all public assemblies the majority of _votes_ decide the question; members of most representative political bodies are chosen by the _suffrages_ of the people; in the execution of a will, every executor has a _voice_ in all that is transacted.

####vulnerable 
**VULNERABLE, WEAK, EXPOSED.**  
_Vulnerable_, from Latin _vulnus_, wound, means easily wounded. It is therefore a synonyme of _weak_, but only in a special sense. _Vulnerable_ refers to only one kind of weakness, and, it is therefore much more limited in its application, but more specific within its own range of application. _Exposed_ expresses the idea involved in _vulnerable_ by an indirect reasoning from cause to effect, as it were. That which is _exposed_ is easily hit by a missile; it is therefore _vulnerable._

####waft 
**WAFT, BEAK, CONVEY, FLOAT, SIGNAL, TRANSMIT.**  
_Waft_, a variant of WAVE (which see), signifies to _bear, convey_, transport something through a fluid or buoyant medium like the air or sea, to _float_, as on the water or through the air, to beckon or _signal_ by moving a flag or other object in the air, to _transmit_ (poetical) a message, good wishes, a blessing; also to turn quickly, as "_"Wafting_ his eyes to the contrary, " Shakespeare's _Winter's Tale_, to buoy up, as "Their lungs being able to _waft_ up their bodies, " Browne's _Vulgar Errors_, and a breath or current, as of air, as "One wide _waft, "_ Thomson's _Winter._

####wag 
**WAG, FLUCTUATE, OSCILLATE, SWING, VIBRATE.**  
_Wag_, from _wegan_, to bear, carry, move (whence _weigh_, to raise or lift, hence, in our sense, to weigh, is derived), signified to move back and forth, to keep moving. _Fluctuate_, from Latin _fluctus_, signified to move like a flood, like the tides of the sea, for instance. _Oscillate_ is derived from _oscillum_, literally "a little mouth, " applied to an image of Bacchus suspended from a tree, and hence meant to swing like a pendulum. _Swing_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _swingan_, to shake. (Compare _swinge_ from the same verb.) _Vibrate_ comes from Latin _vibrare_, to shake, brandish, etc. _Wag_ is a highly colloquial word meaning to move back and forth, especially applied to the conscious movements of living creatures. A dog _wags_ his tail. _Oscillate_ means to _swing_ between two objects. _Fluctuate_ means to rise and fall irregularly like the waves of the sea; _vibrate_ to move with a regular alternate depression and elevation. _Swing_ means simply to move back and forth as if suspended from something.

####wail 
**WAIL, CRY, DEPLORE, GRIEVE, LAMENT, MOAN, WEEP.**  
_Wail_, from Scandinavian _vœla_, signifies to cry woe, from _vœ, vei_, woe, used as an interjection. Compare _woe. Cry_, Old French _crier,_  
Italian _gridare;_ Latin _quiritare_, is a frequentative of Latin _queri_, to complain or lament, whence the word _querulous_ is derived. _Deplore_ comes from Latin _plorare_, to weep, to shed tears. For the derivation of _grieve_ see _grief;_ for _lament_ see _bewail;_ for _moan_ see _groan. Weep_ is derived from Anglo-Saxon _wepan_, to cry aloud, to raise an outcry. All of these terms indicate a different shade of _wailing._ When we _cry_ we make either a low, partially suppressed noise or one that amounts to a shriek or scream, according to the intensity of the cause or our power of self-control; so, too, when we _deplore, grieve_, or _lament_ for or over a distressing condition, the expressions may be entirely inaudible, more apparent in manner or a change of countenance, or be indicated by a _moan_, which is always a low and, generally, prolonged expression of pain or sorrow, or a grief or lamentation may reach the height of hysteria, with its paroxysms of loud laughter or weeping. Then, when we _weep_ we express our grief or anguish by shedding tears, a silent action in itself, but this, too, may be accompanied by an outcry, where the cause is especially intense. 

####wait 
**WAIT, WAIT FOR, AWAIT, LOOK FOR, EXPECT.**  
_Wait, wait for, await_, Old French _waite, gaite_, a guard, allied to Anglo-Saxon _wacian_, to watch, whence the verb _watch_ is itself derived, to see or look, and _expect_, from the Latin _ex_, out of, and _specto_, to behold, both signify originally the same thing as _look for_, that is, to look with concern for a thing.  
All these terms express the action of the mind when directed to future matters of personal concern to the agent. _Wait, wait for_, and _await_ differ less in sense than in application, the former two being in familiar use, and the latter only in the grave style: these words imply the looking simply toward an object in a state of suspense or still regard; as to _wait_ until a person arrives or _wait_ for his arrival; and _await_ the hour of one's death, that is, to keep the mind in readiness for it.  
_Wait_ and _wait for_ refer to matters that are remote and obscure in the prospect or uncertain in the event; _await_ may be applied to that which is considered to be near at hand and probable to happen, and in this sense it is clearly allied to _look for_ and _expect_, the former of which expresses the acts of the eye as well as the mind, the latter, the act of the mind only, in contemplating an object as very probable or even certain. It is our duty patiently to _await_ the severest trials when they threaten us. When children are too much indulged and caressed, they are apt to _look for_ a repetition of caresses at inconvenient seasons; it is in vain to _look for_ or _expect_ happiness from the conjugal state when it is not founded on a cordial and mutual regard.

####waive 
**WAIVE, ABANDON, FOREGO, RELINQUISH, REMIT, RENOUNCE.**  
_Waive_, a very common legal term, derived through Norman French from Old Norse, and ultimately from a Germanic root, _waibyan_, to fluctuate, to swing about, signifies, literally, to give up a claim to something, to abstain from insisting on some right or claim. The term implies a variety of actions. When we _abandon_ a person, object, or purpose, it is to be assumed that we give him or it up permanently, unless a time period is specified; but when we _forego_ an action it is to be supposed that we abandon it temporarily only, either for convenience or expediency, and are privileged to resume it subsequently.  
We _relinquish_ something by giving it up, parting with it, and this, too, may be either a permanent or temporary act; but when we _remit_ anything in the sense of _waive_, we moderate a condition by giving up a part of it, or surrender the condition or object to the other party in interest, as a magistrate may _remit_ or give up a fine he has imposed, for sufficient reason. To _renounce_ a matter, however, admits of but one effect, the total final rejection of it, either by positive repudiation, absolutely disowning it, or by other means of separating ourselves from it. 

####wakeful 
**WAKEFUL, WATCHFUL, VIGILANT.**  
We may be _wakeful_ without being _watchful;_ but we cannot be _watchful_ without being _wakeful. Wakefulness_ is an affair of the body, and depends upon the temperament; _watchfulness_ is an affair of the will, and depends upon the determination: some persons are more _wakeful_ than they wish to be; few are as _watchful_ as they ought to be. _Vigilance_, from the Latin _vigil_, expresses a high degree of _watchfulness_: a sentinel is _watchful_ who on ordinary occasions keeps good _watch_:__ but it is necessary for him, on extraordinary occasions, to be _vigilant_ in order to detect whatever may pass. We are _watchful_ only in the proper sense of _watching;_ but we may be _vigilant_ in detecting moral as well as natural evils.

####wander 
**WANDER, STROLL, RAMBLE, ROVE, ROAM, RANGE.**  
_Wander_, in German _wandern_, is a frequentative of _wenden_, to turn, signifying to turn frequently. To _stroll_, from a Germanic base found in the word to _strike_, allied with _straggle, struggle_, etc., refers to an indefinite finding one's way about — feeling one's way. _Ramble_ is a frequentative of _roam. Rove_, Dutch _roover_, a robber, is derived from Anglo-Saxon _reafian_, to rob, whence _rob_ itself is derived, as well as the verb _bereave._ It referred to the movements of pirates, wandering robbers, and hence came to refer rather to the wandering than to the robbing. _Range_, from Old High German _hring_, allied to _rank_, referred to something set in rows, _ranged_ in an orderly fashion; from this meaning the special significance of moving about in a certain fashion arose because the word referred to the movements of armed troops, ranks of men, and, as in the case of _rove_, came to signify the action rather than the subject acting. The word suggests the scouring of the country by armed men.  
The idea of going in an irregular and free manner is common to all these terms. To _wander_ is to go in no fixed path; to _stroll_ is to _wander_ out of a path that we had taken. To _wander_ may be an involuntary action; a person may _wander_ to a great distance or for an indefinite length of time; in this manner a person _wanders_ who has lost himself in a wood: to _stroll_ is a voluntary action, limited at our discretion; thus when a person takes a walk he sometimes _strolls_ from one path into another as he pleases: to _ramble_ is to _wander_ without any object, and consequently with more than ordinary irregularity; in this manner he who sets out to take a walk, without knowing or thinking where he shall go, _rambles_ as chance directs: to _rove_ is to _wander_ in the same planless manner, but to a wider extent; a fugitive who does not know his road _roves_ about the country in quest of some retreat: to _roam_ is to _wander_ from the impulse of a troubled mind; in this manner a lunatic who has broken loose may _roam_ about the country; so likewise a person who travels about, because he cannot rest in quiet at home, may also be said to _roam_ in quest of peace: to _range_ is the contrary of to _roam;_ as the former indicates a disordered state of mind, the latter indicates composure and fixedness; we _range_ within certain limits, as the hunter _ranges_ the forest, the shepherd _ranges_ the mountains.

####want 
**WANT, NEED, LACK.**  
To be without is the common idea expressed by these terms; but to _want_ (of Scandinavian origin) is to be without that which contributes to our comfort or is an object of our desire; to _need_ (Anglo-Saxon _nyd_, from a root signifying to force — that which forces us to the last extremity), a Germanic word, is to be without that which is essential for our existence or our purposes; to _lack_ expresses a little more than the general idea of being without, unaccompanied by any collateral idea. From the close connection which subsists between desiring and _want_, it is usual to consider what we _want_ as artificial and what we _need_ as natural and indispensable: what one man _wants_ is a superfluity to another; but that which is _needed_ by one is in like circumstances _needed_ by all: tender people _want_ a fire when others would be glad not to have it; all persons _need_ warm clothing and a warm house in the winter.  
To _want_ and _need_ may extend indefinitely to many or all objects; to _lack_, or be deficient, is properly said of a single object; we may want or need everything; we _lack_ one thing, we _lack_ this or that; a rich man may _lack_ understanding, virtue, or religion; he who _wants_ nothing is a happy man; he who _needs_ nothing may be happy if he _wants_ no more than he has; for then he _lacks_ that which alone can make him happy, which is contentment.

_Wave_, from the verb to _wave_, is applied to water in an undulating state; it is, therefore, the generic term, and the rest are specific terms: those _waves_ which swell more than ordinarily are termed _billows_, which is allied to the words _bulge, bag, bowl, bulk, belly_, etc., from a root signifying to swell: those _waves_ which rise higher than usual are termed _surges_, from the Latin _surgere_, to rise: those _waves_ which dash against the shore or against vessels with more than ordinary force are termed _breakers._

####way 
**WAY, MANNER, METHOD, MODE, COURSE, MEANS.**  
All these words denote the steps which are pursued from the beginning to the completion of any work. The _way_ (Anglo-Saxon _weg_, allied to Latin _via)_ is both general and indefinite; it is either taken by accident or chosen by design: the _manner_, from Old French _manière_, manner, through a verb _manier_, to handle, from Latin _manus_, hand, and _method_ (Latin _methodus_, from Greek _μέθοδος_, from _μετά_, after, and _οδός_. way, meaning after the manner of) are species of the _way_ chosen by design. Whoever attempts to do that which is strange to him will at first do it in an awkward _way;_ the _manner_ of conferring a favor is often more than the favor itself; experience supplies men in the end with a suitable _method_ of carrying on their business.  
The _method_ is said of that which requires contrivance; the _mode_ (from Latin _modus_, a measure, manner, kind, way, from a root also found in the verb _mete)_, of that which requires practice and habitual attention, the former being applied to matters of art and the latter to mechanical actions: the master has a good _method_ of teaching to write; the scholar has a good or bad _mode_ of holding his pen. The _course_ (Latin _cursus_, from _currere_, to run — a way in which one runs) and the _means_ are the _way_ which we pursue in our moral conduct: the _course_ is the _course_ of measures which are adopted to produce a certain result; the _means_ collectively for the _course_ which lead to a certain end: in order to obtain legal redress we must pursue a certain _course_ in law; law is one _means_ of gaining redress, but we do wisely, if we can, to adopt the safer and pleasanter _means_ of persuasion and cool remonstrance. 

####wayward 
**WAYWARD, WILFUL.**  
These words both indicate a disposition to follow one's own will, but _wayward_ is a stronger word than _wilful._ The _wilful_ boy does not easily yield his will to that of another; he wishes to have his own way, but the wish may go no further than a mere expression of it in speech or manner. A _wayward_ boy deliberately goes his own way contrary to the wishes of others. He expresses his _wilfulness_ in action. 

####weak 
**WEAK, FEEBLE, INFIRM.**  
_Weak_, allied to the Middle English verb _weaken_, from Anglo-Saxon _wican_, to make weak, is itself derived from an adjective, _wac_, weak, and related to the German _weichen_, to weaken. _Feeble_, Old French _fleble_, is derived from the Latin _flebilis_, from _flere_, to weep, and means _doleful_, a thing to be wept over, hence weak. _Infirm_ (see [debility](entry://debility)).  
The Saxon term _weak_ is here, as it usually is the familiar and universal term; _feeble_ is suited to a more polished style; _infirm_ is only a species of the_ weak:_ we may be _weak_ in body or _mind;_ but we are commonly _feeble_ and _infirm_ only in the body: we may be _weak_ from disease or _weak_ by nature; it equally conveys the gross idea of a defect: but the terms _feeble_ and _infirm_ are qualified expressions for _weakness:_ a child is _feeble_ from its infancy; an old man is _feeble_ from age; the latter may likewise be _infirm_ in consequence of sickness. We pity the _weak_, but their _weakness_ often gives us pain; we assist the _feeble_ when they attempt to walk; we support the _infirm_ when they are unable to stand. The same distinction exists between _weak_ and _feeble_ in the moral use of the words: a _weak_ attempt to excuse a person conveys a reproachful meaning; but the _feeble_ efforts winch we make to defend another may be praiseworthy, although _feeble._  
See also [vulnerable](entry://vulnerable)  
**WEAKEN, ENFEEBLE, DEBILITATE, ENERVATE, INVALID.** — To _weaken_ is to make _weak_, and is, as before, the generic term: to _enfeeble_ is to make _feeble:_ to _debilitate_ is to cause _debility:_ to _enervate_ is to _unnerve;_ and to _invalidate_ is to make not valid or strong: all of which are but modes of _weakening_ applicable to different objects. To _weaken_ may be either a temporary or permanent act when applied to persons; _enfeeble_ is permanent, either as to the body or the mind: we may be _weakened_ suddenly by severe pain; we are _enfeebled_ in a gradual manner, either by the slow effects of disease or age. To _weaken_ is either a particular or a complete act; to _enfeeble_, to _debilitate_, and _enervate_ are properly partial acts: what _enfeebles_ deprives of vital or essential power; what _debilitates_ may lessen power in one particular, though not in another; the severe exercise of any power, such as the memory or the attention, may tend to _debilitate_ that faculty: what _enervates_ acts particularly on the nervous system; it relaxes the frame and unfits the person for action either of body or mind. To _weaken_ is said of things as well as persons; to _invalidate_ is said of things only; we _weaken_ the force of an argument by an injudicious application; we _invalidate_ the claim of another by proving its informality in law. 

####weakness 
See [imperfection](entry://imperfection)

####weal 
**WEAL, WELFARE.**  
Both of these words are derived from Anglo-Saxon _wela_, abundance, allied to Modern English _well_ and _wealth. Weal_ is simply the archaic and poetic term corresponding to _welfare_ in ordinary speech. 

####wealth 
See [riches](entry://riches)

####wean 
**WEAN, ALIENATE, DETACH, WITHDRAW.**  
These terms all suggest the abandonment of some object of affection or desire or something to which one has been accustomed; but they differ in the character of the metaphor under which the idea is suggested and the energy of the action. To _alienate_ (for derivation and meaning see _alien)_ and _wean_ are the strongest of these terms. _Wean_, in Anglo-Saxon _wenian_, to accustom, German _entwohnen_, to accustom to do without, signifies literally to accustom an infant to do without its mother's milk, and figuratively it suggests the detaching or withdrawing of something to which one is as accustomed as the child is to its daily nourishment. _Detach_ (for derivation see _attach)_ means, literally, to unfasten. _Withdraw_ means to draw away. Both of these terms may be used literally of physical objects or figuratively of the mind, the affections, or the desires. 

####weapons

####weariness

####wearisome 
**WEARISOME, TIRESOME, TEDIOUS.**  
_Wearisome_ is the general and indefinite term; _tiresome_ and _tedious_, causing _tedium_, a specific form of _wearisomeness:_ common things may cause _weariness;_ that which acts painfully is either _tiresome_ or _tedious;_ but in different degrees the repetition of the same sounds will grow _tiresome;_ long waiting in anxious suspense is _tedious:_ there is more of the physical in _tiresome_ and of the mental in _tedious._  
**WEARY, TIRE, JADE, HARASS.** — To _weary_ is a frequentative of _wear_, that is, to _wear_ out the strength. To _tire_, Anglo-Saxon _tirian_, to be weary, may be used both as a transitive and an intransitive verb. To _jade_ is derived from the noun _jade_, a term of contempt applied to a worn-out horse. _Harass_ (see [distress](entry://distress)).  
Long exertion _wearies;_ a little exertion will _tire_ a child or a weak man; forced exertions _jade;_ painful exertions or exertions coupled with painful circumstances _harass:_ the horse is _jaded_ who is forced on beyond his strength; the soldier is _harassed_ who in his march is pressed by a pursuing enemy. We are _wearied_ with thinking when it causes us effort to think any longer; we are _tired_ of our employment when it ceases to give us pleasure; we are _jaded_ by incessant attention to business; we are _harassed_ by perpetual complaints which we cannot redress.

####weight 
**WEIGHT, HEAVINESS, GRAVITY.**  
_Weight_, from to _weigh_, is that which a thing _weighs. Heaviness_, from _heavy_ and _heave_, signifies the abstract quality of the _heavy_, or difficult to heave. _Gravity_, from the Latin _gravis_, likewise denotes the same abstract quality.  
_Weight_ is indefinite: whatever may be _weighed_ has a _weight_, whether large or small: _heaviness_ and _gravity_ are the property of bodies having a great _weight. Weight_ is opposed only to that which has or is supposed to have no _weight_, that is, what is incorporeal or immaterial; for we may speak of the _weight_ of the lightest conceivable bodies, as the _weight_ of a feather: _heaviness_ is opposed to lightness; the _heaviness_ of lead is opposed to the lightness of a feather. _Weight_ lies absolutely in the thing; _heaviness_ is relatively considered with respect to the person: we estimate the _weight_ of things according to a certain measure; we estimate the _heaviness_ of things by our feelings. _Gravity_ is that species of _weight_ which is scientifically considered as inherent in certain bodies; the term is therefore properly scientific.  
See also [heavy](entry://heavy); [importance](entry://importance)  
**WEIGHT, BURDEN, LOAD.** — _Weight_ (for derivation see above). _Burden_, from _bear_, signifies the thing borne. _Load_, Anglo-Saxon _lad_, a way, journey, or conveyance, signified originally that which was carried on a journey, hence, in our sense, a _load._ It has been confused with the verb _lade_, which has a different derivation, and this confusion has influenced the meaning.  
The term _weight_ is here considered in common with the other terms, in the sense of a positive _weight; by_ which it is allied to the word _burden:_ the _weight_ is said either of persons or things; the _burden_ more commonly respects persons; the _load_ may be said of either: a person may sink under the _weight_ that rests upon him; a platform may break down from the _weight_ upon it: a person sinks under his _burden_ or _had;_ a cart breaks down from the _load._ The _weight_ is abstractedly taken for what has _weight_, without reference to the cause of its being there; _burden_ and _load_ have respect to the person or thing by which they are produced; accident produces the _weight;_ a person takes a _burden_ upon himself or has it imposed upon him; the _load_ is always laid on: it is not proper to carry any _weight_ that exceeds our strength; those who bear the _burden_ expect to reap the fruit of their labor; he who carries _loads_ must be contented to take such as are given him.  
In the moral application these terms mark the pain which is produced by a pressure; but the _weight_ and _load_ rather describe the positive severity of the pressure; the _burden_ respects the temper and inclinations of the sufferer; the _load_ is in this case a very great _weight:_ a minister of state has a _weight_ on his mind at all times, from the heavy responsibility which attaches to his station; one who labors under strong apprehensions or dread of an evil has a _had_ on his mind; any sort of employment is a _burden_ to one who wishes to be idle; and time unemployed is a _burden_ to him who wishes to be always in action.

####well-being 
**WELL-BEING, WELFARE, PROSPERITY, HAPPINESS.**  
_Well-being_ may be said of one or many, but more of a body; the _well-being_ of society depends upon a due subordination of the different ranks of which it is composed. _Welfare_, or _faring well_, respects the good condition of an individual; a parent is naturally anxious for the _welfare_ of his child. _Well-being_ and _welfare_ consist of such things as more immediately affect our existence: _prosperity_, which comprehends both _well-being_ and _welfare_, includes likewise all that can add to the enjoyments of man. The _prosperity_ of a state or of an individual, therefore, consists in the increase of wealth, power, honors, and the like; as outward circumstances more or less affect the _happiness_ of man: _happiness_ is, therefore, often substituted for _prosperity;_ but it. must never be forgotten that _happiness_ properly lies only in the mind, and that consequently _prosperity_ may exist without _happiness;_ but _happiness_, at least as far as respects a body of men, cannot exist without some portion of _prosperity._  
See also [fortunate](entry://fortunate); [happiness](entry://happiness)

####well-bred 
**WELL-BRED, COURTEOUS, CULTIVATED, POLISHED, REFINED.**  
_Well-bred_, a compound of two English terms, _well_ and _bred_, from _breed_, meaning to generate, beget, signifies a person or animal born of a good breed, stock, or race, or one well-born. The term has a broad application in the personal sense, as it implies refinement and cultivation in either sex. A _courteous_ person _(i.e._, one who has courtly manners) is always polite and obliging: a _cultivated_ one exhibits the training or refining of the intellectual and social faculties; a _polished_ one possesses elegance and suavity of manners: and a _refined_ one displays an unvarying good taste and an instinctive aversion to anything that is coarse or extreme in thought or expression.  
These qualities are not always to be found in one person, for a _courteous_ one may be such from cultivation, not from nature, education, or association; a _polished_ one is not necessarily _courteous_, for he may be such from study, association, or imitation and still lack many of the qualities of good-breeding; but a _cultivated_ one is apt to exhibit the best and most attractive features of a broad and universal training, a wide knowledge of both books and men, and a high regard for the niceties of polite society.

####whole 
**WHOLE, ENTIRE, COMPLETE, TOTAL, INTEGRAL.**  
_Whole_ excludes subtraction; _entire_ excludes division; _complete_ excludes deficiency: a _whole_ orange has had nothing taken from it; an _entire_ orange is not yet cut; and a _complete_ orange is grown to its full size: it is _possible_, therefore, for a thing to be _whole_ and not _entire:_ and to be both, and yet not _complete:_ an orange cut into parts is _whole_ while all the parts remain together, but it is not _entire;_ it may be _whole_ as distinguished from a part, _entire_ as far as it has no wound or incision in it; but it may not be a _complete_ orange if it is defective in its growth. _Whole_ is applied to everything of which there may be a part actually or in imagination; as the _whole_ line, the _whole_ day, the _whole_ world: _entire_ is applied only to such things as may be damaged or injured, or is already damaged to its fullest extent; as an _entire_ building, or _entire_ ruin: _complete_ is applied to that which does not require anything further to be done to it; as a _complete_ house, a _complete_ circle, and the like.  
_Total_, from Low Latin _totalis_, extended from _totus_, the whole, has the same significance, but only a limited application; as a _total_ amount or a _total_ darkness, as distinguished from a partial amount or a partial degree of darkness.  
_Integral_, from _integer_, literally untouched, from _in_ (not) and the root _tag_ which appears in the Latin _tangere_, to touch, has the same signification, but is applied now to parts or numbers not broken.

####wicked 
**WICKED, INIQUITOUS, NEFARIOUS.**  
_Wicked_ (see [bad](entry://bad)) is here the generic term; _iniquitous_, from _iniquus, inœquus_, not equal, signifies that species of _wickedness_ which consists in violating the law of right between man and man; _nefarious_, from the Latin _nefas_, not according to the law (from _fari_, to speak, a law being something spoken, decreed, either by man or a power above man. Compare _fatum_, fate, the thing spoken). The term _wicked_, being indefinite, is commonly applied in a milder sense than _iniquitous;_ and _iniquitous_ than _nefarious:_ it is _wicked_ to deprive another of his property unlawfully, under any circumstances; but it is _iniquitous_ if it be done by fraud and circumvention, and _nefarious_ if it involves any breach of trust; any undue influence over another, in the making of his will, to the detriment of the rightful heir, is _iniquitous;_ any underhand dealing of a servant to defraud his master is _nefarious._

####wield 
**WIELD, BRANDISH.**  
_Wield_, from Anglo-Saxon _wealdan_, to have power, means to exercise with skill and effect. It is used with reference to the skilful handling of a weapon — to _wield_ a sword, to _wield_ an axe — and, figuratively, of the exercising of any power, as when we say "He _wields_ a great influence. " _Brandish_ resembles _wield_ in its physical application. It means, literally, to wield a sword, from Old French _brand_, sword, of Germanic origin. However, it does not imply such a skilful handling as _wield;_ there is more show and flourish in _brandish._ To _brandish_ a sword is to wave it in the air so that every one may see and fear; to _wield_ a sword is to exercise it skilfully in the work for which it was intended. In its figurative application _brandish_ means to make a great show of power and authority, to flourish threateningly.

####will 
**WILL, WISH.**  
The _will_ is that faculty of the soul which is the most prompt and decisive; it immediately impels to action: the _wish_ is but a gentle motion of the soul toward a thing. We can _will_ nothing but what we can effect; we may _wish_ for many things which lie above our reach. The _will_ must be under the entire control of reason or it will lead a person into every mischief: _wishes_ ought to be under the direction of reason or otherwise they may greatly disturb our happiness.  
**WILLINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, SPONTANEOUSLY.** — To do a thing _willingly_ is to do it with a good will; to do a thing _voluntarily_ is to do it of one's own accord: the former implies one's _willingness_ to comply with the wishes of another; we do what is asked of us; it is a mark of good-nature: the latter implies our freedom from foreign influence; we do that which we like to do; it is a mark of our sincerity. It is pleasant to see a child do his task _willingly;_ it is pleasant to see a man _voluntarily_ engage in any service of public good. _Spontaneously_ (from a lost Latin substantive _spons)_ is but a mode of the _voluntary_, applied, however, more commonly to inanimate objects than to the will of persons: the ground produces _spontaneously_ when it produces without culture; and words flow _spontaneously_ which require no effort on the part of the speaker to produce them. If, however, applied to the will, it bespeaks in a stronger degree the totally unbiassed state of the agent's mind: the _spontaneous_ effusions of the heart are more than the _voluntary_ services of benevolence. The _willing_ is opposed to the unwilling, the _voluntary_ to the mechanical or involuntary, the _spontaneous_ to the reluctant or the artificial.

####wisdom 
**WISDOM, PRUDENCE.**  
_Wisdom_, allied to German _wissen_, to know, is the general term; it embraces the whole of practical knowledge: _prudence_ (see **prudent** under [judge](entry://judge)) is a branch of _wisdom. Wisdom_ directs all matters present or to come. _Prudence_, which acts by foresight, directs what is to come. Rules of conduct are framed by _wisdom_, and it is the part of _prudence_ to apply these rules to the business of life. 

####wish 
See [desire](entry://desire); [will](entry://will)

####wit 
**WIT, HUMOR, SATIRE, IRONY, BURLESQUE.**  
_Wit_, like wisdom, according to its original, from Anglo-Saxon _witan_, to know (compare German _wissen)_, signifies knowledge, but it has so extended its meaning as to signify that faculty of the mind by which knowledge or truth is perceived, and in a more limited sense the faculty of discovering the agreements or disagreements of different ideas. _Wit_, in this latter sense, is properly a spontaneous faculty, and is, as it were, a natural gift: labored or forced _wit_ is no _wit._ Reflection and experience supply us with wisdom; study and labor supply us with learning; but _wit_ seizes with an eagle eye that which escapes the notice of the deep thinker and elicits truths which are in vain sought for with any severe effort.  
_Humor_ is a species of _wit_ which flows out of the _humor_ of a person. _Wit_, as distinguished from _humor_, may consist of a single brilliant thought; but _humor_ runs in a vein; it is not a striking, but an equable and pleasing flow of _wit._ Of this description of _wit_ Mr. Addison, who knew best how to explain what _wit_ and _humor_ were, and to illustrate it by his practice, has given us the most admirable specimens in his writings.  
_Humor_ may likewise display itself in actions as well as words, whereby it is more strikingly distinguished from _wit_, which displays itself only in the happy expression of happy thoughts.  
_Satire_ (from _satura lanx_, a full dish, a dish of mixed ingredients, applied figuratively to a species of poetry full of animadversions on different persons and events) and _irony_ from the Greek _ειρωνεία_, simulation and dissimulation, are personal and censorious sorts of _wit_, the first of which openly points at the object and the second in a covert manner takes its aim.  
_Burlesque_ (perhaps from Latin _burrula_, diminutive of _burros_, trifles, Italian _burlesco_, ludicrous) is rather a species of _humor_ than direct _wit_, which consists in an assemblage of ideas extravagantly discordant. The _satire_ and _irony_ are the most ill-natured kinds of _wit; burlesque_ stands in the lowest rank.

####wonder 
**WONDER, ADMIRE, SURPRISE, ASTONISH, AMAZE.**  
_Wonder_ is a Germanic word whose ultimate derivation is unknown. _Admire_ is derived from Latin _admirari_, to wonder at, and allied to _miracle_, a thing to be wondered at. Surprise, compounded of French _sur_, on, and _prise_, taken, the feminine past participle of _prendre_, from Latin _prehendere_, signifies to take on a sudden. _Astonish_, Old French _estoner_, Latin _ex_ and _tonare_, to thunder (compare the word _thunderstruck_, a forceful and colloquial synonyme of _astonished)_, signifies to strike as it were with the overpowering noise of thunder. _Amaze_ signifies to be in a _maze_ so as not to be able to collect one's self.  
That particular feeling which anything unusual produces on our minds is expressed by all these terms, but under various modifications. _Wonder_ is the most indefinite in its signification or application, but it is still the least vivid sentiment of all: it amounts to little more than a pausing of the mind, a suspension of the thinking faculty, an incapacity to fix on a discernible point in an object that rouses our curiosity: it is that state which all must experience at times, but none so much as those who are ignorant: they _wonder_ at everything, because they know nothing. _Admiration_ is _wonder_ mixed with esteem or veneration: the _admirer_ suspends his thoughts, not from the vacancy, but the fulness, of his mind: he is riveted to an object which for a time absorbs his faculties: nothing but what is great and good excites _admiration_, and none but cultivated minds are susceptible of it: an ignorant person cannot _admire_, because he cannot appreciate the value of anything. _Surprise_ and _astonishment_ both arise from that which happens unexpectedly; they are species of _wonder_ differing in degree, and produced only by the events of life: the _surprise_, as its derivation implies, takes us unawares; we are _surprised_ if that does not happen which we calculate upon, as the absence of a friend whom we looked for; or we are _surprised_ if that happens which we did not calculate upon; thus we are _surprised_ to see a friend returned whom we supposed was on his journey: _astonishment_ may be awakened by similar events which are more unexpected and more unaccountable: thus we are _astonished_ to find a friend at our house whom we had every reason to suppose was many hundred miles off; or we are _astonished_ to hear that a person has got safely through a road which we conceived to be absolutely impassable.  
_Surprise_ may for a moment startle; _astonishment_ may stupefy and cause an entire suspension of the faculties; but _amazement_ has also a mixture of perturbation. We may be _surprised_ and _astonished_ at things in which we have no particular interest: we are mostly _amazed_ at that which immediately concerns us.  
**WONDER, MIRACLE, MARVEL, PRODIGY, MONSTER.** — _Wonder_ is that which causes _wonder. Miracle_, Latin _miraculum_, is allied to _admire_, which see above. _Marvel_ is derived from Latin _mirabilia_, which has the same root — signifying wonder. _Prodigy_, from Latin _prod_ for _pro_, and a suppositious word, _agium_, a saying, which also appears in _adage_, means a saying beforehand, hence a sign, token, or portent, something extraordinary. _Monster_, in Latin _monstrum_, comes from _moneo_, to warn, because among the Romans any unaccountable appearance was considered as an indication of some future event.  
_Wonders_ are natural: _miracles_ are supernatural. The whole universe is full of _wonders;_ the Bible contains an account of the _miracles_ which happened in those days. _Wonders_ are real; _marvels_ are often fictitious; _prodigies_ are extravagant and imaginary. Natural history is full of _wonders;_ travels abound in _marvels_ or in _marvellous_ stories, which are the inventions either of the artful or the ignorant and credulous: ancient history contains numberless accounts of _prodigies. Wonders_ are fitting to the laws of nature; they are _wonderful_ only as respects ourselves: _monsters_ are violations of the laws of nature. The production of a tree from a grain of seed is a _wonder;_ but the production of a calf with two heads is a _monster._

####word 
**WORD, TERM, EXPRESSION.**  
_Word_ is here the generic term, the other two are specific. Every _term_ and _expression_ is a _word_, but every _word_ is not denominated a _term_ or _expression._ Language consists of _words;_ they are the connected sounds which serve for the communication of thought. _Term_, from _terminus_, a boundary, signifies any _word_ that has a specific or limited meaning; _expression_ (see [express](entry://express)) signifies any _word_ which conveys a forcible meaning. Usage determines _words;_ science fixes _terms;_ sentiment provides _expressions._ The purity of a style depends on the choice of _words;_ the precision of a writer depends upon the choice of his _terms;_ the force of a writer depends upon the aptitude of his _expressions._ The grammarian treats of the nature of _words;_ the philosopher weighs the value of scientific _terms;_ the rhetorician estimates the force of _expressions._ See also [promise](entry://promise)

####work 
**WORK, LABOR, TOIL, DRUDGERY, TASK.**  
_Work_, in Saxon _weorc_, Greek _εργον_, is the general term, as including that which calls for the exertion of our strength: _labor_ (for derivation see that term) differs from it in the degree of exertion required; it is hard _work: toil_, probably connected with _till_, expresses a still higher degree of painful exertion: _drudgery_ (see [servant](entry://servant)) implies a mean and degrading _work._ Every member of society must _work_ for his support, if he is not in independent circumstances: the poor are obliged to _labor_ for their daily subsistence; some are compelled to _toil_ incessantly for the pittance which they earn: _drudgery_ falls to the lot of those who are the lowest in society. A man wishes to complete his _work;_ he is desirous of resting from his _labor;_ he seeks for a respite from his _toil;_ he submits to _drudgery. Task_, from Latin _tasca_, a tax _(tax_ being another form of the same word), is a _work_ imposed by others, and consequently more or less burdensome. Sometimes taken in the good sense for that which one imposes on one's self.

####worry 
**WORRY, ANXIETY.**  
_Worry_ comes from Anglo-Saxon _wyrgan_, to strangle, to harm. It has thus a metaphorical significance similar to that of _anxiety_, for which see [care](entry://care). As a substantive _worry_ has almost the same meaning as _anxiety_, but being an Anglo-Saxon word, whereas _anxiety_ is of Latin origin, it differs in quality and atmosphere. _Worry_ is a more homely and emphatic word than _anxiety_, and suggests the psychological state more directly.

####writer 
**WRITER, PENMAN, SCRIBE.**  
_Writer_ is an indefinite term; every one who _writes_ is called a _writer;_ but none are _penmen_ but such as are expert at their pen. Many who profess to teach _writing_ are themselves but sorry _writers:_ the best _penmen_ are not always the best teachers of _writing._ The _scribe_ is one who _writes_ for the purpose of copying; he is, therefore, an official _writer. Writer_ and _penman_ have an extended application to one who _writes_ his own compositions; the former is now used for an author or composer, as the _writer_ of a letter or the _writer_ of a book; the latter for one who _pens_ anything worthy of notice for the use of the public.  
_Scribe_ may be taken for one who performs, as it were, the office of _writing_ for another.  
**WRITER, AUTHOR.** — Writer refers us to the act of _writing; author_ (from Latin _auctor_, an originator, literally one who makes a thing to grow, from _augure_, to increase) lays emphasis on the act of inventing. There are, therefore, many _writers_ who are not _authors_, but there is no _author_ of books who may not be termed a _writer:_ compilers and contributors to periodical works are properly _writers_, though not always entitled to the name of _authors._ Poets and historians are properly termed _authors_ rather than _writers._

####wry 
**WRY, DISTORTED, TWISTED, ASKEW, WARPED.**  
All of these words signify a turning from a normal position. _Wry_ means bent to one side and somewhat twisted in the bending. _Distorted_, from _torquere_, to turn, means turned out of a normal state or position, with the implication not simply of bending, but of turning round and round. _Twisted_, past participle of _twist_, meant originally wound round and round, as in the case of two threads wound around and around each other by _twisting. Askew_ is from Old Low German; it means turned aside like a _shying_ horse, and is derived from the root that appears in English _shy. Warped_ means made uneven in outline, referring to a flat surface that has become somewhat arched or otherwise irregular. 

####xanthous

####xylography 
**XYLOGRAPHY, WOOD-ENGRAVING.**  
_Xylography_ is the technical term, _wood-engraving_ the common term for the same process. The difference is therefore not one of meaning, but of usage. _Xylography_, a term compounded of the Greek _ξύλον_, wood, and _γράφει_, to write or draw, signifies the art of the _wood-engraver_ or the act of cutting designs or figures on wood for printing, an art that in recent years has largely been superseded by various processes for book and periodical illustration. The term is also applied to a mode of printing or graining from the natural surface of the wood, and to a process of decorative painting on wood. 

####yearn 
**YEARN, CRAVE, LONG.**  
_Yearn, crave_, and _long_, as verbs, all mean to desire intensely, but the quality of the desire differs. _Long_ means simply to wish intensely. _Yearn_, from Anglo-Saxon _georn_, eager, has a special suggestion of tenderness; _crave_ is used of physical appetite.

####yonder 
**YONDER, BEYOND, YON.**  
The first two words are derived from the Anglo-Saxon adverb _geond; yon_ is the Saxon adjective _geon_, signifying a place removed by more or less distance. _Yonder_ means at a distance; it is becoming slightly archaic now. _Yon_ is a poetic abbreviation for _yonder. Beyond_ differs from _yonder_ in signifying a place on the other side of a given point. We may say in general that the village is _yonder_, or we may say quite specifically that it is _beyond_ the river. 

####youthful 
**YOUTHFUL, JUVENILE, PUERILE.**  
_Youthful_ signifies full of _youth_, or in the complete state of _youth: juvenile_, from the Latin _juvenis_, signifies the same; but _puerile_, from _puer_, a boy, signifies, literally, _boyish._ Hence the first two terms are taken in an indifferent sense, but the latter in a bad sense, or at least always in the sense of what is suitable to a boy only: thus we speak of _youthful_ vigor, _youthful_ employments, _juvenile_ performances, _juvenile_ years, and the like: but _puerile_ objections, _puerile_ conduct, and the like. We expect nothing from a _youth_ but what is _juvenile;_ we are surprised and dissatisfied to see what is _puerile_ in a. man. 

####zany 
**ZANY, HARLEQUIN, MERRY-ANDREW. **  
_Zany_, a substantive derived from the Old Italian _zane_, in Modern Italian _zanni_, the familiar form of Giovanni or John, signifies a silly-John, a former appellation of buffoon and clown, a person who amuses others professionally by jests, antics, odd gestures, etc., especially by awkwardly and ineffectually trying to mimic the other actors. A _harlequin_ (a word of uncertain origin, but probably from Old Low German _helle Kyn_, "kin of hell, " goblins, devils; thence by extension clown, buffoon) is the performer in the Italian pantomime who wears party-colored garments and carries a talismanic wand with which he produces unexpected or ludicrous effects while executing his part; he is the lover of Columbine.  
_Merry-andrew_ is a term that is now comparatively seldom used in the United States, though at one time it was quite common here and very popular in England. It is said to be derived from Andrew Borde, physician to Henry VIII, "who, in order to instruct the people, used to address them at fairs and other crowded places in an eccentric and amusing manner, " but this is doubtful. 

####zeal 
**ZEAL, ARDOR, EARNESTNESS.**  
All of these words indicate energy and intensity of interest. _Earnestness_ indicates a general attitude of mind; _ardor_ is applied to warm emotions; _zeal_ indicates energy applied to the carrying through of a cause or the propagation of an idea. 

####zenith 
**ZENITH, ACME, APEX.**  
_Zenith_, a substantive from the Old French _cenith_, derived from Arabic _samt_, pronounced _semt_, signifies the summit or top of the heavens, the part directly over a spectator's head. Figuratively, it is the highest or culminating point of anything seen or referred to. _Acme_, Greek _ακμή_, has a similar meaning; it means the point or top. _Apex_, Latin _apex_, means the summit or topmost point of something. While the two words had originally the same meaning, _acme_ is now used with a figurative significance, whereas _apex_ more clearly retains its original literal meaning. 

####zeppelin 
See [aircraft](entry://aircraft)

####zero 
**ZERO, CIPHER, NAUGHT, NEUTRAL, NOTHING.**  
_Zero_ is the same in form in French and Italian, and is considered a contraction of _zefiro_ or _zifro_, from the Arabian _sifr_, meaning a cipher. The Old Latin treatises on arithmetic Latinized the Arabic term as _zephyrum_, which became _zefiro_ in Italian, and then _zero._ Low Latin _zifra_, Old French _cifre_, Modern French _chiffre_, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese _cifra_, German _ziffer_, all meaning nothing, the absence of anything, all come from a parallel Arabic form _zifra. Cipher_ and _zero_, therefore, are doublets, and each is indicated by the sign 0. In general these terms mean no thing or _nothing_, and stand for the _neutral_ point between any ascending and descending scale or series, implying the extreme point of depression.  
In the thermometer and similar scales the _zero_ is the point or line from which all the divisions are measured, up or down. In the Centigrade and Reaumur thermometers _zero_ marks the freezing-point of water; in the Fahrenheit scale it is placed at 32° below that freezing-point. The _absolute zero_ of the temperature is the lowest possible temperature which the nature of heat permits, or — 273° Centigrade. _Zero_ in arithmetic is called _naught_, and implies no number; in algebra, no quantity; in mathematics it possesses no value of its own, but when placed after a number it increases the value of that number tenfold.  
While _zero_ and _cipher_ are distinctly scientific terms, they, and more commonly the latter, have come to be applied to persons and objects in a depreciative sense, as a person is said to be a mere _cipher_ who possesses no value in character, importance, influence, or otherwise, or who has got down to _zero_, when he has expended all his money, energy, will-power: so an object, proposition, argument, objection, is said not to amount to a _cipher_ when it is unquestionably worthless. 

####zest 
**ZEST, GUSTO.**  
_Zest_, in Old French the same, Modern French _zeste_, from the Latin _schistos_, that from the Greek _σχίζω_, meaning to peel, skin, or divide, the French form implying a piece of the skin of a citron or lemon, and the English form something that gives a special relish, an added taste, as the skin or rind of a citron or lemon, commonly used in cookery for flavoring. That is _zest_, therefore, that imparts to anything an increased taste, flavor, satisfaction, enjoyment, a piquancy, or sharpness, tartness, spiciness. _Gusto_, from the Latin _gusto_, taste, meant the taste, the hearty enjoyment of food, hence any particularly hearty enjoyment. _Zest_ and _gusto_ both mean keenness of enjoyment, but _gusto_ indicates a more pronounced pleasure than _zest._
